President Uhuru Kenyatta will carry the day on October 26, Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has said. He urged residents not to waste their vote, but to choose the winning team. He said there is no way NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga will emerge the winner since the opposition alliance has not campaigned. He likened Uhuru and Raila to farmers. “There is a saying utavuna ulichokipanda [You’ll reap what you sow]. Only the farmer who clears the field and plants expects a harvest. The wider the area planted, the more the harvest,” Mutua said. He spoke at Masii market, Mwala subcounty, on Monday during a rally by Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto. “Clear logic [shows] that the person who has humbled himself by going to the ground to seek votes will definitely have a bigger harvest,” Mutua said.
