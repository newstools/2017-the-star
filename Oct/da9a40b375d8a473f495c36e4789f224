Three pupils were on Monday hospitalised after police lobbied teargas canister at Patrickâ€™s Awich Kodingo ECDE centre during the anti-IEBC protests in Kisumu. In a Facebook post accompanied by a video, Beatrice Schneli-Okello, founder of the school located in Nyalenda slums wrote that during the protest, police officers unlawfully entered into the school premises. She said they hurled teargas in the compound without any regard for the children aged between three-seven years and the staff. â€œI fail to understand this kind of attack on small children. It is unthinkable to target innocent children in school premises. The children are traumatised and some have suffered injuries," the post reads. Social media users have expressed their disappointment after viewing the video, which shows children screaming and running away as Good Samaritans and teachers try to take them away from the teargas. People are demanding for action to be take on the police officers. When the Star visited the school yesterday, head teacher Eunice Odhiambo said two pupils were taken to Milimani Hospital. The third one is at Lumumba Hospital. Odhiambo said 20 students did not report to the school yesterday. She said parents said they were affected by the teargas. The school has 101 pupils. Odhiambo said on Monday, teachers heard a bang and pupils started screaming in one of the classrooms. "When we ran to the class, we found a teargas canister near the door and started evacuating the students," she said. Odhiambo said before all the students were evacuated from the classes, a second and third teargas canister were lobbied into the school.
