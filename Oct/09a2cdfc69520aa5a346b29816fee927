Kenya lags behind in ensuring accountability and provision of quality basic education, Unesco has said. This is in the latest Global Educational Monitoring report launched yesterday. The report highlights a host of issues that affect the
quality of basic education. They include poor regulations, which have
seen establishment of sub-standard learning institutions, poor
infrastructure, shortage of teachers and discrimination.  The report states that in sub-Saharan Africa, 41 per cent of children of primary school age do not complete basic education while 87 per cent do not reach the minimum proficiency level in reading. The report further found that despite progress made in recent years, many countries are struggling to cater for their poorest children. Quoting the World Inequitable Database on Education, the report
points out that the percentage of out of school children in Kenya is
three per cent in primary, nine per cent in lower primary and 27 per
cent in upper secondary. Speaking to the Star, director of the GEM report Manos Antoninis said it is government's responsibility to provide universal quality education. He said accountability is indispensable in achieving the goal.
