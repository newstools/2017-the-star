Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo has raised the alarm over what he calls ghost projects under the national National Constituencies Development Fund in his constituency. He said former Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo must account for the stalled projects or risk being thrown in jail. Addressing journalists in Siaya on Thursday, Odhiambo said all Akala Township projects have stalled yet they were funded. Efforts to get a comment from Midiwo were unsuccessful. “We are informed on September 18 the contractor, Rouzhene Investment, tried to deliver some materials at Akala after learning that we are following up the matter,” Odhiambo said.  He cited another issue at the Gotfo women’s group. He claimed Sh5 million meant for table banking was misused. He accused the group’s officials Roselyn Okoko (chairperson), Katura Odondo (treasurer), Eunice Apombe (secretary) and Ambrose Rieni (ex-official of irregular spending. However, Okoko dismissed the claims, saying the group is as “white as snow” and has no corruption record. She said the cash they shared was given by ex-Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero.
