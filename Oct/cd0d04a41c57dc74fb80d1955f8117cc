Nyandarua Speaker Wahome Ndegwa now wants President Uhuru Kenyatta to declare a state of emergency. He said this should be in areas that are likely to experience violence during the October 26 election. Ndegwa on Wednesday said Article 58 and 132 of the Constitution gives Uhuru the powers to do so. The Constitution stipulates that a state of emergency may be declared when the state is threatened by war, invasion, general insurrection, disorder, natural disaster or other public emergency. He said soldiers should be sent to provide security in areas where the opposition is likely to prevent voting. NASA leaders have vowed that their supporters will not take part in the fresh poll citing lack of reforms at the IEBC. "The threat that there shall be no election as this amounts to disorder," Ndegwa said. "Let the soldiers keep security for voting to take place. We will then swear-in Uhuru for the country to move on." The speaker said Jubilee Party has the numbers, ability and its members are willing to vote. Ndegwa said opposition leader Raila Odinga need to appreciate that the Supreme Court ordered that polls be done in 60 days. "If he feels that IEBC was wrong in preparing the repeat presidential elections within 60 days, he should have petitioned the same court to vacate the order." He chided the ODM leader for using " illegal means" to prevent Kenyans from exercising their democratic right. Ndegwa reiterated that Uhuru won the August 8 elections further blaming evil forces for working through the court to nullify the win. On October 2, Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko said the president was free to declare a state of emergency. He said this while responding to Opposition's intention to boycott the fresh election if their demands are not considered.
