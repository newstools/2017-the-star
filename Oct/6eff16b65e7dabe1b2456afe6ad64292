Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho has suffered a blow after the High Court declined to strike out a petition challenging his election. Justice Lydia Achode yesterday said Joho had failed to give compelling reasons to warrant dismissal of the petition. Joho wanted the petition struck out for “failing to meet the threshold and comply with election rules”. Former senator Hassan Omar challenged Joho’s election and wanted the court to declare his victory null and void. But Joho said Omar had failed to enjoin “my deputy” in the petition, as the two positions “are inseparable”. Achode said even though it was crucial for the deputy governor to be enjoined, “he was just a beneficiary of Joho’s election.” She said a running mate is automatically elected when the flagbearer is voted for, hence there was no need to enjoin Joho’s number two. Achode added that according to the law, the deputy governor would be expected to vacate office should the governor’s election be annulled. Joho had claimed that even if the court nullifies his election, his deputy would take over. Achode further declined to dismiss the petition on grounds that the deputy governor candidate of the petitioner was also not enjoined. She said the deputy registrar acknowledged receiving only a petition from Omar and not his deputy candidate. Achode noted, however, that it does not change anything, considering both Omar and his running mate Linda Shuma signed it. She also declined to issue orders extending time to allow Omar amend in his petition. The judge said such amendments should have been done within 28 days after the winners were declared as stipulated in the Constitution. Omar ran on the Wiper ticket, but has since defected to Jubilee.
