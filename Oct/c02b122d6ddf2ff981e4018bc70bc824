Angry youths held Siaya MCAs hostage for 30 minutes on Tuesday for rejecting nine candidates nominated for county executive posts. They were unhappy with the ward representatives for rejecting the CECs selected for Governor Cornel Rasanga's cabinet. When the County Assembly adjourned at 8pm, youths vowed not to let MCAs out until they passed the names of rejected candidates. The sergeant-at-arms was forced to shoot in the air to disperse the youths who hurled stones at the Assembly premises and broke windows. Usonga MCA Sylvester Madialo said the committee rejected the nominees for failing to fit the portfolio they were picked for. "This means that the governor is at liberty to realign his nominees as per their qualifications," he said. The MCAs only approved Mary Omondi as Education CEC. The Assembly was set to debate the nominees at 2pm but this was delayed as youths chanted "We are watching you" outside the premises.
