Nyeri leaders have kicked off vigorous campaigns to ensure 100 per cent voter turnout on October 26. This is meant to boost President Uhuru Kenyattaâ€™s chances of winning the rerun ordered by the Supreme Court. On September 1 it annulled the August 8 presidential results. The leaders set aside their differences and joined hands to mobilise voters in the countyâ€™s six constituencies â€” Othaya, Mukurwe-ini, Mathira, Kieni, Tetu and Nyeri Town. They crisscrossed the county on Saturday to woo voters.  They included Senator Ephraim Maina, Governor Wahome Gakuru, woman MP Rahab Mukami. Deputy Governor Mutahi Kahiga and assembly speaker John Kaguchia. Others were MPs Anthony Kiai (Mukurwe-ini), Rigathi Gachagua (Mathira), Kanini Kega (Kieni), Gichuhi Mwangi (Tetu), Ngunjiri Wambugu (Nyeri Town) and more than 30 MCAs.
