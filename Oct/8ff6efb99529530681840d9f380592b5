Nairobi Water, National Cereal and Produce Board ( men and women),  Kenya Defence Forces(men), have been invited to next month’s East and Central Africa handball  Club Championships in  Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Should they confirm their participation, they will join compatriots Black Mamba (men) and Strathmore University (men) teams who have already confirmed their inclusions. Kenya Handball Federation fixture secretary, Charles Omondi, said the five clubs have received the letters and he awaits their confirmation to the event. “We hope the said teams will be part of the annual event. We are aware of the processes these teams have to go through with their respective employers to get a green light. We will just wait and see,” said Omondi. At the same time, Omondi noted  that  they will have to shelve the national league matches set for this weekend if there happens to be political unrest following yesterday’s repeated presidential election. He said:“It will depend with the political atmosphere from today (yesterday). We will gauge and if all goes well we will have the last weekend’s postponed matches played on Sunday.” “But should there be violence, we will have to shelve the fixtures again.” The matches were postponed due to heavy downpour that has been witnessed in many parts of the country.
