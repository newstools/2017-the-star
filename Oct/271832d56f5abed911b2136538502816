IEBC cannot hold a credible election on October 26, Thirdway Alliance presidential candidate Ekuru Aukot has said. Aukot said the electoral body is ‘seriously incompetent’ and do not not command confidence from the public. He said he was gathering evidence to be presented to the Supreme Court to nullify the election if it will be bungled like on August 8. He said IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati has confirmed the commission is unable to hold free and fair elections. Chebukati claimed his work had been made difficult by the political class. “This why we are pausing our campaigns to seek answers. Who is this political class frustrating IEBC?” Aukot asked. He said he is apprehensive that his name has not been configured in the KIEMS kit. “I talked to IEBC CEO Ezra Chiloba yesterday and he denied the reports. We want this assurance in writing or else we will be moving to Supreme Court,” Aukot said. He blamed Jubilee and NASA for the current mess facing IEBC. ”They want a commission which favours them,” he said. He said his party has issues they must sort out with IEBC before it can participate in the repeat elections scheduled for next week. He said they will not hesitate to move to the Supreme Court if the election is bungled again.  Aukot also suggested that President Uhuru Kenyatta and NASA’s Raila Odinga be barred from participating in future elections. ”We should adopt a Madagascar way where they have banned certain politicians from taking part in election,” he said.
