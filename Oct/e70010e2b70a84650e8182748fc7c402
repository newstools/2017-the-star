Embu ODM chairman Moses Wamuru and NASA supporters yesterday were stoned by Jubilee supporters who disrupted their anti-IEBC demo. They fled on motorbikes as scores of Jubilee supporters threw stones at them after the official defiantly continued to address the press, despite the JP people ordering him to stop. A car Wamuru was travelling in was also stoned and posters of opposition chief Raila Odinga were torn and burnt on the Embu-Meru highway. The NASA supporters wanted to present a memorandum to the IEBC offices detailing their demands, including the removal of CEO Ezra Chiloba and other senior officers.  However, after marching for 300 metres Kirimari and Ruguru-Ngandori Jubilee ward representatives emerged accompanied by supporters and ordered them to stop the procession.  They said Embu is a Jubilee zone and no demo would be allowed that embarrasses President Uhuru Kenyatta.  The MCAs and their supporters walked away but Wamuuru proceeded with the procession to the annoyance of the Jubilee leaders.  â€œThe action by the Jubilee supporters is a violation of freedom to picket, which is provided for in the Constitution. Embu leaders should cultivate political tolerance,â€ Wamuuru said later.  He said they will stage another protest on Friday.
