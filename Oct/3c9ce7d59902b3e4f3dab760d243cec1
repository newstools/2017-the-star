Mwingi Central MP Gideon Mulyungi (pictured) yesterday was charged with hate speech directed to President Uhuru Kenyatta. He appeared in a Kitui court. Mulyungi denied three charges. He was ordered released on Sh200,000 bail. The case will be heard on November 23. Kitui chief magistrate Maryanne Murage ordered the case be mentioned on November 13. Mulyungi was represented by lawyers Dan Maanzo and Malinga Mbaluka. Mulyungi appeared composed even as he pleaded not guilty. He was accused of offensive conduct when he addressed an anti-election rally in Kalundu, Kitui town, on October 23. Mulyungi also denied two hate speech charges one of uttering a statement that being a member of the Kamba community he had a “bigger manhood” than that the President who is a Kikuyu, inciting bad blood between the two communities. He was also accused of claiming the President was chasing after Kamba girls. Maanzo asked the court to give Mulyungi favourable bond terms. He said he is a respectable person being an MP and a former Permanent Secretary and would not abscond.
