NASA leader Raila Odinga’s announcement the alliance will transform into a resistance movement is an empty threat, Nyandarua governor, Francis Kimemia has said. “As a person who has been in charge of security, I know our country is stable and threats will not work,” he said. Kimemia spoke on Thursday at Nyandundo Primary School, Mirangine, after voting in the repeat presidential election. He said every Kenyan wants peace. “Even in Nyanza, if you ask the youth what they want, it is peace and jobs, not violence,” Kimemia said. He said the IEBC should expedite vote counting so President Uhuru Kenyatta is sworn in. “We have overstayed on politics and a nation cannot live on politics always,” Kimemia said. He said all the leaders who contested the presidency in August, including Raila, were on the ballot and it was the NASA leader’s right to vote or abstain. Kimemia said the four counties where voting did not take place will not affect the outcome If anything, he said, “the law only requires polling centres to be opened for the election to be considered to have taken place”. Kimemia urged Kenyans to maintain peace. “Those who voted should respect those who didn’t, and those who did not vote should not threaten those who voted as threats will not take anybody anywhere,” he said. Kimemia said investors need to be assured their investments and property are not be destroyed whenever there is an election. “That is something we must think about as Kenyans. Maybe we call a meeting after swearing in the President and discuss the Kenya we want,” he said. He termed Uhuru, the speakers of National Assembly and Senate, and Chief Justice David Maraga as pillars of the nation.
