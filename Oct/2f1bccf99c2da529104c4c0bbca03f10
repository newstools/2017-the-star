The National Police Service needs to come up with other means than lethal action to contain demonstrations in the CBDs of the three biggest cities. The killings so far reported cannot possibly be in the cops’ favour. At the same time, organisers of and participants in demos should be cognizant of Article 37 of the Constitution, section 40, which is from the Penal Code, vand makes clear that the police protect peaceable demonstrators. A demonstrator who carries a rock and shouts at police does not strike even observers as a peaceable demonstrator. The police have been accused of being trigger-happy and carrying only live rounds. The public reaction, particularly among members and supporters of the National Super Alliance, is turning ugly. All the signs of radicalization, which does not only involve Islamic youth, are there, particularly in the talk about “protecting ourselves”. The police must stop the blanket and brazen use of live bullets. The demonstrators must stop behaving anything but peaceable.
