Kagwe Mungai is one of the Kenyan male artistes with a massive following from the ladies. The Creeper star sat down with Word Is, where he finally revealed he is single. “I love my fans back. At the moment, I’m dating myself, which keeps me focused on my writing. When I’m in my relationship, I keep it a hundred per cent. I needed to be by myself. Things change.” So, who is his ideal woman? “I don’t know. I like to be surprised. I don’t like to write how the person must be.” The singer, who is riding high with a song called Paloma, says he appreciates the ladies for their love. “I don’t have groupies, I have loyal supporters. At the end of the day, it’s all love. These are people who support what I do.” Mungai, who doubles up as a producer, has produced some of the best hit songs Kenya has ever seen, and he had a message for slay queens. “Live your best life. At the end of the day, you are the one who has to live with your body and choices. Whatever makes you sleep at night, do it.” Talking about elections, the singer said informed decisions should be considered. “Let’s make informed decisions, let’s be wise about it. Let’s be wise about things and remember we are brothers and sisters and have free and fair elections.” Mungai will be performing at the United Sounds Of Africa event that is set to go down next Saturday.
