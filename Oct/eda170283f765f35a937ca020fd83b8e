Samburu residents are ready for the repeat presidential election scheduled for next week, county woman representative Maison Leshoomo has said. Speaking to reporters in Maralal town on Wednesday, Leshoomo said that the election will take place in Samburu as was planned. She downplayed IEBC commissioner Roselyn Akombe’s resignation, saying it wont affect the commission. “IEBC is already training 109 presiding officers and their deputies for Samburu West constituency. So her resignation will not intimidate the process,” Leshoomo said. She criticised Akombe for tendering her resignation from outside the country. “That means she did not have Kenya at heart,” Leshoomo said. She said President Uhuru Kenyatta will win the repeat poll.
