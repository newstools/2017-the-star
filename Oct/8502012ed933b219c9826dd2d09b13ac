Elders and leaders from Goreale ward, Lagdera constituency, have appealed to the Garissa county government for animal fodder to save their remaining herds from the current biting drought. MCA Abdurhaman Idris told reporters the national government should take charge and work with the county government and aid agencies to alleviate the suffering of the affected residents. He appealed for water and food supply for both animals and people. A number of farmlands have been turned into grazing fields to save the animals. This is exactly how the Laikipia crisis of 2016 started, with herders driving their livestock hundreds of miles away and invading settled communities. Many of the herders were armed. The problem has been aggravated by the failure of successive long rains. Like human populations, livestock populations also exert pressure on land. Garissa and Mandera residents should stop keeping larger and larger herds of livestock simply because they are more than the land can carry. Desperate scenes such as those in Northeastern should be avoided.
