Opposition leader Raila Odinga is readying the stage for 2022 by causing turmoil and a political dead end, Jubilee politician Suleiman Shahbal has said.  Raila is a lost cause because “he can’t and won’t pull a political miracle,” Shahbal said. The banker and businessman was the Jubilee candidate for Mombasa governor, losing to Hassan Joho who won in a landslide. “As far as we are concerned, we have already won this election and what is certain is Jubilee will still win in 2022,” he told the Star on the phone on Monday. Shahbal said it is not yet clear for whom Raila is preparing the ground.  He said the former Prime Minister made a “huge” tactical blunder by withdrawing from the repeat presidential election scheduled for tomorrow.
