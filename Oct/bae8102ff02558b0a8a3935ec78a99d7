The National Transport and Safety Authority will crack down on Kakamega boda boda riders who are untrained and havenâ€™t licensed their bikes. The authority plans to ensure all riders are trained and licensed. In a meeting with Traffic police and boda boda riders in Shianda, Mumias, on Friday, NTSA informed riders of road safety laws in the Traffic Act. It warned it will soon crack the whip on those who â€œjust pick up a motorcycle and start riding without training and following the due processâ€. NTSA Western region director Sammy Mbugua said many accidents involve boda boda riders. He, added, however, that motorcycle-related deaths have declined countrywide by 9.2 per cent, compared to last year. NTSA has launched a new training manual for boda boda riders, covering both theory and practical examinations. After vigorous training on road safety, riders will be able to understand all road signs and rules. This will minimise road accidents. The motorcycle transport commonly referred to as â€˜boda bodaâ€™ is the most adopted means used in Kakamega.
