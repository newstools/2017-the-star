Edith Chelimo clocked 1:05:58 to retain the Marseille-Cassis 20km road race in France on Sunday. Chelimo win follows her strong showing early this month when she won Cardiff Half Marathon in 1:05:52 to become the seventh fastest woman in history.  The Ethiopian pair of Muliye Dekebo and Dera Dida managed to stay with Chelimo during the climb up to the Col de la Gineste, passing the five and 10-km marks in 16:21 and 35:07 respectively. Chelimo then upped the pace as Dida and Dekebo began to falter.  Chelimo covered the next 5km section in 15:01 to hit the 15-km checkpoint in 50:08 before extending her lead over the final stretch to win in 1:05:58; taking a massive 64 seconds from the 1:07:02 course record set last year by Kenyan Joyciline Jepkosgei.  It’s noteworthy that the final 3kms of the course were slightly modified and a little tougher than in previous editions.  This was Chelimo’s last appearance of the year as she’s is slated to run at the Houston Half Marathon on January 14.  Dekebo held on to finish second in 1:06:41, with compatriot Dera Dida third in 1:07:54 and Stacey Ndiwa fourth in 1:08.21 In the men’s category.  Evans Cheruiyot came home second in 59.50 with Wilfred Kimitei placing third in 1:00.09. Ethiopia’s Jemal Yimer clinched the event by posting 59:16. Meanwhile, Bahrain’s Aweke Ayalew and Ethiopia’s Senbere Teferi will defend their titles at the Cross de Atapuerca in Burgos on 12 November, the first of seven IAAF Cross Country Permit meetings for the 2017-2018 winter season. Last year Ayalew put an end to Imane Merga’s winning streak. Following five successive wins, Ethiopia’s Merga could only finish a distant third last year as Ayalew and Uganda’s Timothy Toroitich finished almost level with one another. The defending champion was also beaten in the women’s race last year as Teferi won convincingly in 24:48 with 2014 and 2015 winner Belaynesh Oljira down in fourth place.  Both Ethiopian women will return to Atapuerca next month. Rwandan youngsters Onesphore Nzikwinkunda and Jean Marie Vianney Niyomukiza will also be in action in the men’s race.
