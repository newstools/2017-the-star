The UN World Food Programme will from this month cut food rations by 30 per cent for the 420,000 refugees living in the Dadaab and Kakuma camps. In a statement, WFP country director Annalisa Conte said the programme faces a critical shortage of resources which has compelled it to reduce the amount of food given to the refugees. This happens only six months after WFP resumed full rations. However, Conte indicated that if more funds are received, it can mobilise food stocks from within the region, and increase the amount of cash transfers to the refugees, allowing them to buy adequate food from local markets. â€œCutting rations is a last resort and we hope it is only a short-term measure as we continue to appeal to the international community to assist. We however urgently need Sh2.9 billion to adequately cover the food assistance needs for the refugees for the next six months,â€ Conte said. WFP provides food assistance to refugees in Kenya as a combination of food - cereals, pulses, vegetable oil, and nutrient-enriched flour - and cash transfers sent via mobile phones used to buy fresh food items from local traders. Starting this month, it will reduce the share of food but cash transfers remain unchanged.
