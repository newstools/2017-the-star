Seven people have been arrested in Kisumu county over Fridayâ€™s violent anti-IEBC demos. County commander Titus Yoma said two were arrested for breaking into and looting Tumaini Supermarket, while five hurled stones at passers-by. Yoma said they are looking for goods stolen from Tumaini and the culprits. Property of undetermined value was stolen or destroyed as the youths broke the supermarketâ€™s windows and stole food from the eatery. He said they were told the demonstration will be peaceful. â€œPeaceful demonstration does not involve destroying property and breaking into a supermarket. We will ensure that those who were involved are arrested and charged in court,â€ Yoma said on Saturday. He said they have learnt from social media and other outlets of people with police teargas. Yoma said they should give it back before police catch up with them.  The Friday demonstration in Kisumu town started out peacefully in the morning but turned chaotic after a group of youths broke into Tumaini. The youths broke the supermarketâ€™s windows and main entrance, attacked staff and proceeded to loot the store.  Police fired tear gas and shot in the air to force the youths out of the supermarket.  Elsewhere, police came in Land Cruisers and water cannon trucks to disperse the protesters who headed towards Kondele.  They vandalised water pipes belonging to the Kisumu Water and Sewerage Company.  Most businesses remained as the protesters lit bonfires and carried a mock coffin of IEBC chief executive Ezra Chiloba.  ODM executive director Oduor Ongâ€™wen condemned the incident, saying it is a broader scheme to delegitimise the demonstrations to call for electoral justice.  â€œThe deliberate and conspicuous absence of the police as this incident happened points to an unacceptable complicity and choreography for which the local police leadership must come out clean,â€ the statement from ODM read.
