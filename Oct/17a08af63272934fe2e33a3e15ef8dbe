Kisumu Senator Fred Outa will be investigated for allegedly disrupting IEBC trainings in the county. Nyanza regional coordinator Wilson Njega said they are probing leaders involved in the incidents. "Nobody is above the law regardless of their status," he said on Wednesday. Youths have vandalised Huduma Centre premises in the county where the electoral agency was training officers for the October 26 repeat poll. Njega said more than 10 people have been arrested following the incident. IEBC is facing its biggest hurdle yet in pulling off the presidential rerun on NASA's turf where many Opposition supporters are determined to block voting. This week they disrupted training of poll officials in all Luo Nyanza counties. Some recruits backed out and fled, fearing for their lives.

His battle cry is 'no reforms, no election' and it's sweeping his strongholds like wildfire. Even as the crisis deepened, Raila on Tuesday said he is ready to engage President Uhuru Kenyatta in conducting a free, fair and credible poll — not the formation of a coalition government. In addition, commissioner Roselyn Akombe has resigned saying IEBC will not be able to deliver a credible election. Kisumu Governor Anyang' Nyong'o has said the resignation means there will be no repeat election and the exercise should be called off. More on this: IEBC caught in nightmare with eight days to polls
