Investors are holding back on purchasing land in Kiambu county satellite towns due to a new plan to regulate land use to boost food security, a survey has shown. The Land Price Index, by Hass Consult, for the third quarter ending September, showed proposed policies by the Kiambu county department of Land, Housing and Physical Planning on land use had affected investor sentiment in the region. “Land for real estate commands a significantly higher price than land meant for agricultural use. Policies that prevent the change in land use from agriculture to real estate will therefore adversely affect land prices,” Hass Consult head of development consulting and research Sakina Hassanali said. She said investors were waiting until they were certain that purchases would not be affected by the proposed policies. Of the seven Kiambu county satellite towns, Limuru recorded the highest land price drop of 5.7 per cent to Sh19.5 million per acre compared to last quarter. Juja prices dropped 5 per cent to Sh10.9 million while Ruiru dropped 3.5 per cent to Sh22.5 million. Kiambu Town price per acre dropped 1.8 per cent to Sh42.6 million, Tigoni 1.7 per cent to Sh20.8 million and Thika had the narrowest drop of 0.6 per cent. to Sh18.3 million. Overall, land prices in Nairobi’s satellite surburbs dropped 1.7 per cent between July and September as investors opted to postpone investment on the back of the prolonged electioneering period. The report shows that overall property prices declined 1.8 per cent while asking rents went down by 0.3 per cent with apartments accounting for the biggest drop. “Buyers are sensitive to risks associated with the political process and are therefore unlikely to make decisions until there is an end to this period,” Hassanali said.
