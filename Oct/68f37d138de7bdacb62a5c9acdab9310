Two governors and five legislators from Nyanza have urged IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati to suspend tomorrow’s repeat presidential poll. Governors Okoth Obado (Migori), Cyprian Awiti (Homa Bay) and MPs Gladys Wanga (Homa Bay), Millie Odhiambo (Suba North), Adipo Okuome (Karachuonyo), Martin Owino (Ndhiwa) and Paul Abuor (Rongo) said the presidential election is invalid. They took their ‘no-election’ campaigns to Mbita, Homa Bay town and Rodi Kopany on Tuesday. The politicians said the IEBC should call for a fresh election. Wanga said postponing the election would give the IEBC enough time to plan and conduct a credible election. “Kenya is faced with a crisis that can only be saved by Chebukati. Let him postpone this election and arrange for a fresh and credible one,” she said. Wanga accused the IEBC of going against the directives of the Supreme Court. “The Supreme Court ordered for a fresh election to be conducted. This should be called off if one candidate withdraws,” she added. Odhiambo accused the IEBC of getting directives from Jubilee, allowing its mandate to be compromised. She said Roselyn Akombe’s resignation exposed the ills at the IEBC.
