ODM has demanded the removal of Nyanza regional commissioner Wilson Njega and police commander Leonard Katana over police brutality. Party secretary for political affairs Opiyo Wandayi said the officers have failed to protect the lives of innocent citizens. The party also wants the the county commissioners in Kisumu, Siaya, Migori and Homa Bay transferred. In a press release on Tuesday Wandayi accused Njega and Katana of incompetence. The Ugunja MP said they cannot continue to serve in a region where rogue police officers are killing Kenyans under their watch. “It is now clear that the entire security apparatus in Nyanza, under Njega and Katana, has failed and or neglected to protect the lives and property of the people under their watch as required by law,” Wandayi said. He said the relationship between the officers and the people has degenerated beyond repair. Wandayi accused police of unfairly targeting the Luo community participating in peaceful anti-IEBC protests to push for electoral reforms. “We continue to lose innocent lives while multitudes get maimed in the hands of trigger-happy police as the anti-IEBC demonstrations continue,” he added. Wandayi cited the 18-year-old KCSE candidate who was shot dead in cold blood by police on Monday in Kisumu. Michael Okoth, a student of Vihiga High School, was shot in Kondele as he walked home after buying ice cream. An officer is alleged to have removed a knife from his pocket and slit Okoth’s throat to remove a bullet, which would have been used as evidence. The officers allegedly chased away onlookers and burnt a motorcycle they wanted to use to rush Okoth to hospital. A two-and-half-year-old was also shot in the family compound in Nyamasaria while playing with other children away from the anti-IEBC demos.
