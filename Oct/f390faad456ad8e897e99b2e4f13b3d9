The election petition challenging Kisii Senator Sam Ongeriâ€™s (pictured) win will start next Tuesday.  Two petitioners, Charles Obera and George Ogake, want Ongeriâ€™s victory nullified on grounds the election was marred with irregularities.  Obera and Ogake also argue that non-compliance, irregularities and improprieties affected the integrity and quality of the election and results.  They also want the court to direct the IEBC to a conduct fresh election.  The petitioners have listed the IEBC, county returning officer Sidney Namlungu and Samson Ongeri as the first, second and third respondents. Ongeri is represented by senior counsel and Nyamira Senator Okongâ€™o Omogeni. The case will be presided over by Justice Winfridah Okwany.
