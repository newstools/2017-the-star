Former Ruiru MP Esther Gathogo yesterday said she would rather have President Uhuru Kenyatta as her boyfriend than have NASA leader Raila Odinga. She said Raila does not fit “my class of boyfriends” because he “keeps refusing everything and giving flimsy excuses”. “Someone has proved more than once that he doesn’t care about development. That person is Raila Odinga. I call him Mr I Don’t Want. I wouldn’t have him as my boyfriend because his character suggests he can’t satisfy me. Fellow women, stay away from him,” she said to the disappointment of residents. Gathogo said having Raila as a boyfriend is like growing a tree in a desert. “It will never get a drop of water and will die from too much heat and unfavourable environment,” she added. She said Uhuru is “cool and focussed” and would “satisfy my urge”, and given a chance, she would grab the opportunity. Gathogo spoke at a rally in Lamu. She said Uhuru cares for Kenyans, as evidenced by the free maternity care. She was in the company of Jubilee MPs Stanley Muthama (Lamu West MP), Nelson Ributhi (Subukia), Peter Kamande (Maragwa) and Omingo Magara — loser in the August 8 Kisii senator race.
