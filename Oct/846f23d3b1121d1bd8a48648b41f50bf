The Supreme Court will on Tuesday next week make a decision in a case in which IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati seeks to find out whether he has powers to alter Forms 34B. He wants to know if he has powers to amend Forms 34 B received at the National Tallying Centre from the Constituency Tallying Centre should they differ with results contained in Forms 34A after verification. Yesterday, the commission’s lawyers told the court it is not clear what the chairman should do if he discovers discrepancies in the forms. Lawyer Kamau Karori said whereas the Supreme Court upheld the Maina Kiai case, the judges in the majority decision criticised the commission’s failure to verify the results “What happens when the national returning officer reads a result that he knows could be wrong? It is in those circumstances that we have sought a clarification,” the lawyer said. The Court of Appeal, in Kiai’s case, held that the IEBC cannot alter the presidential poll results announced by its returning officers in constituencies. This means the presidential results announced in the constituencies are final and all that is expected at the National Tallying Centre is addition of the results announced at the constituencies. However, the Supreme Court said, “There can be no logical explanation as to why in tallying the Forms 34B into Forms 34B into the Forms 34C, this primary documents (Forms 34A) were completely disregarded.” President Uhuru Kenyatta supports the application for clarification. “If there is any doubt, however misplaced, the court ought to entertain them and look at what the complaints or concerns raised are,” his lawyer Kimani Kiragu said. But NASA, through lawyers Willis Otieno and Prof Ben Sihanya, opposed the application, saying the IEBC should have sought a clarification from the High Court. Elias Mutuma, representing Dr Ekuru Aukot of the Thirdway Alliance, also said the application should be referred back to the High Court.
