Given the continuing political stalemate after the Supreme Court’s annulment of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s reelection at the August 8 General Election, the biggest responsibility for saving Kenya from crisis rests on President Uhuru Kenyatta and NASA leader Raila Odinga. Both want to be President but Kenya has reached a point where the national interest must trump personal ambitions. To become President both must serve the interests of all 40-million-plus Kenyans, not just Jubilee and NASA. Whatever the true results of the August 8 election were, neither contender has behaved like a national leader and statesman. Both have ferociously pursued their political coalition’s goals. Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission chairman Wafula Chebukati was quite right yesterday when he warned the political parties to uphold the law and to stop intimidating IEBC commissioners and staff ahead of the October 26 election. Uhuru and Raila need to meet behind closed doors away from their hardliner strategists and supporters and consider the big picture that is the national interest.
