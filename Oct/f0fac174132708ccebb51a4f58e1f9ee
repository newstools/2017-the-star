Elders from Garissa have asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to begindialogue with NASA leader Raila Odinga to save the country from plunging into chaos. Addressing the press in Garissa town yesterday, the elders expressed regret that Thursday’s presidential rerun has split the country along tribal lines. They were led by Kenya Livestock Marketing Council chairman Dubat Amey.  The council operates in 13 arid and semi-arid counties.  Amey said the country was on the brink of dangrous turmoil and urged Uhuru not to allow Jubilee hardliners to override his humility. “Building this country took a lot of time but destroying it will not take more than three days.  When you were sworn in, you were given a sword that signifi es authority.  The future of this country is in your hands. Please call for dialogue with Raila,” Amey said. He added, “You have the wisdom and energy to do that because you are a humble man and we have trust in you.” Amey also urged Raila not to call for protests or any acts that may distabilise the country. He criticised NASA’s creation of a resistance movement wing, saying it is a bad precedent that could end in chaos and violence. “Don’t plunge this country into problems,” Amey said. Raila boycotted last week’s presidential rerun and demanded a fresh one in 90 days. He said he will only talk to Uhuru about polls in 90 days.
