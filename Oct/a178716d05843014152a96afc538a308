Calls to postpone October 26 repeat polls, ordered by the Supreme Court will plunge the country into crisis, Jubilee Secretary General Raphael Tuju has said. Speaking at the party's headquarters in Nairobi yesterday, Tuju said that Raila's threats for no election were dangerous. “It sounds nice when you look at it one way but how about if the incumbent President says he has observed the political terrain and the horizon and that he is not comfortable with the election taking place and withdraws his candidature?” Tuju said. He said Uhuru will continue being in office if elections are called off because he is the incumbent. Tuju yesterday filed a petition at the Supreme Court in which he wants Raila forced to participate in next week's election. Raila and his running-mate Kalonzo Musyoka have contravened the court's directive by creating a non-conducive environment for IEBC to conduct the election, Tuju said in his affidavit. “They cannot be allowed to deliberately create an environment whose ultimate aim is to ensure that the elections are not conducted as directed by this court," he said. He accused Raila of trying to ascend to power through anarchy. "They have engaged in conduct that can only be termed as illegal, unlawful and disrespectful," Tuju said. He asked the opposition leaders to instead move to court if they want the election stopped. “Any discussion between Jubilee and NASA can only be null and void," he said.
