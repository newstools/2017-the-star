Kakamega NASA leaders have demanded a professional and bipartisan approach in the implementation of a secure and transparent Kenya Integrated Elections Management System.  They said this is crucial for a free and fair repeat election on October 26.  The IEBC has awarded the tender for provision of technology to OT-Morpho of France.  The firm has hired experts to reconfigure the KIEMS kits. In a statement, county assembly Minority leader David Ndakwa said Jubilee must stop the ill-advised and rushed changes to electoral laws in the middle of the election timetable.  â€œWe warn that weâ€™ll neither participate in nor recognise the outcome of an election undertaken without administrative reforms or under an electoral framework that reverses the gains that were painstakingly negotiated by NASA and Jubilee,â€ he said, accompanied by Governor Wycliffe Oparanya, Deputy Governor Philip Kutima, MP Elsie Muhanda, assembly leader Joel Ongoro and Lugari ODM chairman Nabii Nabwera.
