DPP Keriako Tobiko has directed IG Joseph Boinnet to immediately arrest Kandara MP Alice Wahome over the assault of a returning officer. Alloys Kemo, senior assistant director of public prosecutions, also asked police to start a thorough probe into the matter involving returning officer Martin Malonza. "Our attention has been drawn to a video circulating on social media depicting the MP assaulting and obstructing an IEBC official on October 27," Kemo said on Saturday in a letter to Boinnet. "Consequently, I am directed by the DPP to advise [Boinnet] to immediately and urgently commence investigations into the incident and cause the said MP to be arrested and charged in a court of law." NASA supporters have claimed Wahome attempted to rig while Jubilee Party's praised her for protecting President Uhuru Kenyatta's votes. IEBC earlier called for the prosecution of the MP saying she had committed an electoral offence and intimidated an official doing his work.

Wahome said constituency chief agent John Gitau had raised the matter with the returning officer who said the issue would be dealt with at the end of the exercise.," she said, "I also asked Malonza to give us more time to agree on what to do about the wrong entry but he flatly refused and became loud and uncooperative without regarding the agents." The lawmaker said the issue is not about changing results, but a disagreement on how to deal with "votes stolen from Uhuru".
