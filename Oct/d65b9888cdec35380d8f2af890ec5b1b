The High Court has temporarily suspended a gazette notice compelling bottled water, soft drinks and cosmetics manufactures to post excise stamps on the goods. This followed a suit by activist Okiya Omtatah against the Treasury CS, KRA commissioner general, and SICPA securities, a firm based in Switzerland. In the October 3 gazette notice, KRA had indicated that the said goods were to have excise duty stickers on their products effective November 1. But Justice John Mativo issued temporary orders on Monday to stop CS Henry Rotich and KRA commissioner John Njiraini from implementing the directive. The directive was for goods imported or manufactured locally. Omtatah argued the notice was contrary to directions of the Public Investments Committee of the 11th Parliament. He said the August House suspended implementation of taxable goods management systems by the sued parties. This was pending the conclusion of investigations by the National Assembly, following a petition by the Kenya Private Sector Alliance in June. Omtatah told the court the matter was urgent since it exposed manufacturers, importers and consumer to the burden of meeting extra production costs unlawfully. KRA wants manufacturers of non-alcoholic beverages, food supplements and cosmetics to affix excise duty stamps on their products. The taxman wanted to introduce the stamps through the Excise Goods Management System for beer, mineral water, juices and soft drinks. Read: KRA's new stamps to curb tax evasion, fakes
