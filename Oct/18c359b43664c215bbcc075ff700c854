A section of MPs from West Pokot county have said they will back the amendments on the electoral laws. The leaders also urged residents to support President Uhuru Kenyatta during the repeat election. The legislators said contrary to allegations by the opposition, the proposed law will not curtail powers of independent institutions. They spoke during the homecoming celebration of Suam MCA Robert Komole in Kopolio village. The lawmakers included Kacheliba MP Mark Lomunokol (pictured), Kapenguriaâ€™s Samuel Moroto and West Pokot woman representative Lillian Tomitom. They said the amendments will address glaring challenges in electoral laws. â€œWe have no network in some areas. If we had the manual system, the country could not be going back to the election. We donâ€™t want to spoil the country and we should have the two systems, in case one fails,â€ Lomunokol said. They faulted NASA leaders for calling demonstrations, saying they are hurting the economy. â€œThe countryâ€™s economy is headed in the wrong direction. If the situation persists, the country will be divided,â€ Lomunokol said. Moroto said the Constitution allows â€œtoo much freedomâ€. â€œFormer President Daniel Moi and DP William Ruto knew the Constitution had issues. We have not reached that level of getting too much freedom. We should revert to the former systems,â€ he said. Moroto urged NASA MPs to back the amendments. â€œThe law might haunt them if they boycott participation. They should come during the third reading and participate if they want to make changes,â€ Moroto said. Tomitom faulted NASA over is push to remove IEBC officials. â€œKenyans vote for leaders and the courts should not alter anything. NASA should concentrate on campaigning ,â€ she said.
