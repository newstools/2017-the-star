Religious leaders yesterday petitioned the Inspector General of Police to provide security for everyone voting tomorrow. The Inter-Religious Consortium pledged to support President Uhuru Kenyatta’s reelection. They said they wish to see the country moving forward from the current political standoff. In a petition addressed to Interior CS Fred Matiang’i, Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet and the county police commander, they said the government is obligated to ensure Kenyans exercise their democratic rights. “What we are asking is that those who have decided to vote be provided with adequate security so we are able to vote in a safe environment,” the petition says. They urged police to arrest and charge any politician who threatens anyone, incites violence orblocks anyone from voting.  “The opposition should be ready to respect the same law they say they are defending by allowing the election to take place as ordered by the Supreme Court,” they said. ”We understand there are some Kenyans who do not wish to vote on October 26. This is alright, because it is their democratic right not to vote, just as it is a right to vote.” The petition seeks a continued ban on NASA demonstrations, saying businesses have been hurt for more than two months. “This cannot go on anymore. We need to move forward, shun violence and let the people learn from the refugees in our country,” the leaders said. They further dismissed calls for dialogue by other religious leaders. Early this month, religious leaders, trade unions and the African Union urged both President Uhuru Kenyatta and NASA’s Raila Odinga to rise above partisan and personal interests and put Kenya first.  NCIC secretary Canon Peter Karanja said a government of national unity may be the best solution. “We would like our leaders not to close the door on this possibility,” Karanja said.  He has been involved in behind-the-scenes discussions between religious leaders and both sides of the political divide.
