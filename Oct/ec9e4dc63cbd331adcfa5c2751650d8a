The family of a man allegedly arrested by Ngong police on September 2 want to know his whereabouts. Daniel Letuyia, 28, is was reportedly picked by a known senior officer in Ngong town a day after police asked for his photo. Evelyn Ochieng, his wife who is seven months pregnant, told The Star on Monday that Letuyia was bundled into the boot of a car belonging to the senior officer. The man owns a second-hand shoe shop in the town. Ngong OCPD George Seda did not answer calls while Kajiado county police commander Kipkemoi Rop did not respond to SMSs for comment on the matter. Evelyn said her husband called her after he was arrested, saying he was being taken to Ngong police station by a Mr Gambo who is said to be the Ngong OCS. "On calling him back, someone picked up and told me "Mfwateni pangani (follow him to Pangani police station)," she said. "Before Letuyia was arrested, police led by Ngong deputy OCS invaded our home on September 1 and picked my husband's portrait from the wall." She said the family's efforts for more information from police have been unsuccessful. "The Ngong OCS claims he was in Mombasa on the night of the arrest. The officer we found at the station on the night of the arrest told us the OCS had been on duty the whole night." The woman said they have a reason to be afraid especially considering the cases of people going missing while in police custody. On September 3, Evelyn and her mother in law Peris were asked by police in Ngong to make a formal missing person complaint. The case was reported at the station under OB number 25/3/9/2017. Evelyn said that a week later, they went to see Seda, who handed them over to the Ngong DCIO. "The DCIO told us to go home and wait for his call. We have not received the call or any information since then."
