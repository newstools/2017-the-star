A lawyer has petitioned the National Assembly to begin the process of declaring the minority Kuria region in Migori a new county. Alan Chacha from Kuria West, filed the petition with the assembly clerk on Friday. That was two days after 2,000 Kuria delegates met President Uhuru Kenyatta at State House, Nairobi, and called for their own county. The petition said the Kuria community should be listed among marginalised communities in the country as stipulated by the Constitution. Chacha wants the community recognised as marginalised to safeguard the rights of its members. He said they are underrepresented as the majority Luo community locked them out by having the governor, women MP, senator and speaker. The deputy governor is, however, a Kuria. Dennitah Ghati, the former woman MP, was nominated by ODM to Parliament.
