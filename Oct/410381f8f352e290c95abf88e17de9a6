Persistent drought has wiped out thousands of livestock and threatened the lives of millions of Kenyans. The National Disaster Management Unit says 23 counties suffer most. Water CS Eugene Wamalwa yesterday announced Sh758 million spending to supply water to a million residents in drought-stricken ASAL counties until December. The money will be spent on bowsers, procurement and distribution of collapsible tanks and borehole rehabilitation. While the government is allowed to spend Sh100 million in the water trucking programme, a sustainable water management strategy is required. County governments, though not responsible for the water function, and the state should find permanent solutions to the water shortage. Water can be harnessed for irrigation; there are many success stories that can be emulated. Mororo, Garissa, is an example. Most of Kenya receives heavy rains that cause major damage, while the water goes to waste. Then there are long dry spells in areas that were flooded just weeks earlier. Stop-gap measures are no substitute for long-term, sustainable water management.
