After finishing third in the GOtv tournament where they smacked Vihiga United 2-1 in the third play-off, Sony Sugar hope to carry the same form to today’s match when they accost Chemelil Sugar at Chemelil Sports Complex.
Sony saw off the National Super League side to finish third in the GOtv tournament and today Salim Babu’s charges will be in office again in a SportPesa Premier League match against fellow millers Chemelil who sit a place higher than them in the standings.
The 2006 league champions are not taking any chances against Chemelil as a straight win will elevate them four places in on the log, putting them in the top 10 bracket. The confidence gained while finishing third in the competitive GOtv Shield is seen as a motivating factor for the Awendo-based club who are eyeing a win in the match dubbed “Millers derby”.
Salim Babu will heavily rely on the striking pair of George Abege and Amos Asembeka who have 11 goals between them. Experienced Abdallah Hamisi is set to lead the four-man midfield while Joseph Omweri will be tasked with  marshaling the four-man defence to complete the 4-4-2 format. Chemelil will be praying for a repeat of first leg result, where they subjected their fellow millers a 2-0 defeat.
A win will for Abdallah Juma boys will lift them a place up on the standings and ensure a double win over Sony in the season. Juma is likely to stick with the experienced John Waw to man the goal and a four-man defence to shield the goalkeeper from the goal hungry Sony strikers.
A five-man midfield is likely to start so as to absorb Sony’s fast passing game as well as assisting the defence. Collins Neto is likely to be deployed as a lone centre forward to complete the 4-5-1 formation preferred by Chemelil. A win for Sony will elevate them from 12th to ninth with 38 points while Chemelil will upgrade from 10th to ninth with 39 points.
