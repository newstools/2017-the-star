An Australian woman on Thursday was shot dead when she resisted orders to surrender her mobile phone to suspected thugs in Karen, Nairobi. The Hillcrest Preparatory School teacher, named by the ABC as Gabrielle Maina, was walking on Warai Road, where a gang riding on a motorbike waylaid her. Police said one of the gunmen demanded she surrenders her phone. The middle-aged woman is said to have resisted the orders, prompting the gunmen to shoot her once. They grabbed the phone and escaped. According to West Australian media, Maina was shot dead after dropping her son at a friend’s house. Maina was rushed to a nearby hospital, where she was pronounced dead. The police said no arrest had been made. She has been in Kenya since September 2015. Her Facebook page says she was from Armidale. The school has sent its condolences to Maina’s family. The school will reopen on Monday.
