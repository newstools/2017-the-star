NASA leader Raila Odinga is trying to make Kenya ungovernable but Jubilee will prevent him, Kericho Senator Aron Cheruiyot has said. Cheruiyot said, “As Jubilee leaders, we will not let him get away with it,” he said on Thursday. “Kenya has done its best in terms of security, but NASA leaders seem to negate that by issuing unwarranted threats to the government.”  Raila called for a boycott of the presidential rerun on Thursday, saying the election was rigged. On Wednesday, Raila said NASA will become a national resistance movement.  “Raila must be forced to account for every statement that threatens national security,” Cheruiyot said. He also criticised Kisumu leaders for their failure to restrain youths from barricading roads on the Kericho-Kisumu borders. He said youths have been barricading the Kipsitet-Muhoroni road and stoning vehicles for three weeks. Turnout was low. Most voters arrived as early as 5am. There was heavy security presence. Governor Paul Chepkwony, Cheruiyot and woman representative Florence Bore led residents in voting.  The governor voted at Keongo Primary School in Ainamoi constituency.  Kericho commissioner Muktar Abdi assured residents of security during and after the polls.
