The late Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo had a premonition of his death, a day before he was found dead at his Kwa Kyelu ranch in Machakos. His second wife Nduku yesterday told a Machakos court that her husband said his life was in danger after seeing some insects in their house. Mutula died in 2013, barely a few months after he won the county Senate seat. â€œI had noticed some insects in the house. I wanted to call a fumigation company, but he told me, and I quote: â€˜My life is in danger. I cannot allow strangers in the houseâ€™,â€ Nduku said. She asked her husband whether it was about a threat he had received earlier, but â€œhe did not want to discuss the matterâ€. Nduku said Mutula told her â€œwhat you do not know will never hurt you.â€ She said Mutula looked bothered, but did not disclose the nature of the threat. Nduku added that her husband had received threats in a letter that was sent to him with some powder in it. She said the letter was sent to a school in Mbooni in 2009. â€œThe letter was written in red. It read: Mutula Kilonzo breath your last,â€ she told the court. Nduku told the court Mutula also received a threat in 2012 from a woman who said she had been sent by her boss to kill him. The threat was sent in form of a message to his phone. Both threats were reported to the police. She added that she did not get to know who the woman was. â€œHe was expressing the fears to his life on Thursday, a day before his death,â€ Nduku said, adding she had last seen her husband that Friday morning before he left for work. She told magistrate Kipkurui Kibellion that she had been married to the late senator for 31 years and she had not known him to suffer from any ailment. At the time of his death, the late legislator was, however, taking some lozenges for a cold, Nduku added. She said her relationship with the children of the first wife was strained. Nduku blamed it on their mother, â€œwho was unhappy when I got married to Mutulaâ€. Hearing continues on October 22.
