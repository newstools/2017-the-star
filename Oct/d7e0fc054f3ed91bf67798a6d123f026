Marius Kimutai won the 22nd Volkswagen Ljubljana Marathon on Sunday. Kimutai, the winner of the Rotterdam Marathon in April, broke away from compatriot Solomon Kirwa Yego in the 39th kilometre en-route to a 2:08:33 victory, more than a minute clear of Yego who clocked 2:09:36. It was clear early on that the gusting winds that would knock down barricades along several parts of the course would dampen most hopes for serious race record assaults. A modest opening 10-km split of 30:44 in the men’s race confirmed that quickly, with a group of ten in contention. The pack was reduced by just one at 20-km, with six still running for the victory when they crossed the 30-km marker in 1:32:20. Soon thereafter, Kimutai and Yego surged ahead, leaving Albert Korir and Philip Sanga Kimutai to battle for the third podium spot. The lead pair ran stride for stride at 35km but Kimutai, finally free of the headwind that he battled for most of the race, pulled away for good as the two returned to the edge of the Slovenian capital’s old town centre. Kimutai extended his lead dramatically over the final 2kms, but managed to come up 14 seconds shy of Limenih Getachew’s 2:08:19 race record set in 2015. “The strong wind was a problem,” said the 25-year-old, who set his life-time best of 2:05:47 in Amsterdam last year where he finished third. “After 32km the wind was okay, but until then it was quite hard.” While he faded over the waning 3km, Yego held his position firmly to finish second, reaching the finish 59 seconds ahead of Korir, who clocked 2:10:35. Sanga Kimutai was next in 2:11:02 with Vincent Kipkorir Tonui rounding out a Kenyan sweep of the top five spots in 2:12:12. In the women’s category, Purity Changwony came second in 2:27:52 with Jane Seurey third in 2:28:05. The race was won by Ethiopia’s Shuko Wote in 2:27:02.
