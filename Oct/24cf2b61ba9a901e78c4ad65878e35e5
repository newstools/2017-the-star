The Western Kenya Region Council of Elders has urged President Uhuru Kenyatta and NASA chief Raila Odinga to dialogue. They said a Nusu Mkate government is not a solution, adding the Constitution does not provide for a coalition. The presidential rerun is on October 26 and Raila has withdrawn and called for protests and no election until IEBC carries out reforms. Led by their chairman Philip Masinde, the elders said without dialogue, peace will be elusive. They were drawn from Kakamega, Vihiga, Bungoma and Busia counties. “The duo should seat together and negotiate. We are begging for peace in the country. Dialogue is the only final solution and they should start it immediately,” Masinde said yesterday. The elders said an independent committee should deal with urgent issues. “Jubilee and NASA should withdraw their demands and only submit those they consider urgent,” Masinde said Let the negotiating committee deal with urgent issues with sober minds and peoples’ interests at heart. Masinde said many people are losing focus and spewing dangerous words to please their masters. “Let them look at the issues affecting the nation and let whatever agreement they reach be blessed by the parties concerned and Parliament,” he said. People should differentiate between true leaders who love the country and self-seekers, Masinde said. “Our forefathers fought for Independence. They vowed to live in peace and unity. Anybody suggesting and instigating the dismantling of Kenya is an enemy,” he said. Masinde was accompanied by members Patrick Chaka, Japheth Barua, Josphat Sakwa and Jonathan Wabala. At the weekend, a section of Busia elders said they will support President Uhuru Kenyatta’s reelection in next Thursday’s election.
