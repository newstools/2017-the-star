A Githunguri police officer in charge of a station and his junior officers are on the spot for alleged misconduct and colluding with offenders to defeat justice. Residents have sent a letter to Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet (pictured) to have them investigated. The letter has been copied to the National Police Serviceâ€™s internal affairs unit and the Kenya Police headquarters. Residents accuse the OCS and his officers of colluding with civilians, especially in matters concerning land succession, to fabricate charges against interested parties so they can be jailed to allow sale of land. Efforts to reach the officers for comments were unsuccessful. In August, residents petitioned Chief Justice David Maraga to probe alleged collusion of Judiciary and police officers, whom they accused of benefitting from making false charges. Last month, Maraga and promised to take action against court officials found complicit. He also directed residents to report to the Inspector General so the problem can be fixed conclusively. Maraga also told those aggrieved by court rulings to appeal. A case cited in the letter to Boinnet says Peter Njoroge Kago, a retired army officer with police connections, fabricated charges against his two brothers. He said one brother had attacked him with a knife over their family estates. But residents disagree and instead say it was Kogo who stabbed his brother. Kogoâ€™s two brothers were arrested and charged. Residents want the Inspector General to investigate how Kogo manipulated the officers to have his brothers charged. They say the officers are out to fix the innocent, instead of having criminals are brought to book.
