Nyeri Governor Wahome Gakuru (pictured) will soon conduct an audit of the countyâ€™s liabilities. Financial, human resource, legal and governance audits will be conducted to ensure only genuine liabilities are paid and staff are properly deployed. The county government will also set up a County Government Internal Audit Committee to strengthen the risk management and compliance agenda. â€œWe can only be truly accountable, if we continuously engage with the people who elected us. We plan to fully implement our County Public Participation Act and very soon, we will be setting up public participation and civic education units with full-time staff,â€ Gakuru said. He plans to hire village administrators to improve their engagement with communities at the grassroots level.
