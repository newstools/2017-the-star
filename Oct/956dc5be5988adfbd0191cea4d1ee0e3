With larger screens and more 4G handsets, watching videos on our phones has become as common as browsing Facebook or even replying to messages!  But we've all been there, you're watching a YouTube video on your phone - maybe its a funny clip or maybe its the perfect music mix that you've spent a while perfecting.  All of a sudden, you get a message, and while most of the time you can ignore it, this time you have to reply, which unfortunately means that you have to stop your music. It can be incredibly frustrating!  Luckily, this is now a problem of the past with the new Oppo A71 available at Safaricom shops.  Already one of the leading phone manufacturers in the world, Oppo has released a new split screen function that allows you to stay on YouTube and reply to messages at the same time.  It’s as easy as opening the apps you want to use, holding down the overview button and choosing your two apps to use simultaneously!  The new Oppo phone also has plenty of other fantastic features like increased mobile banking security and ultra HD photos.  Get yours exclusively at Safaricom shops for only SH19,990.
