Former Kakamega chief of staff Nabii Nabwera was on
Monday arrested at his home in Pan Paper, Lugari constituency. He was arrested by CID, NIS and plainclothes officers
at 10am as he was about to leave for the day. Police
linked him to leaflets that had been circulated in the area at the weekend warning
people against voting in the fresh presidential election tomorrow. Nabwera is the head of ODM strategy team in
Kakamega county. He was taken to Lumakanda police station where he recorded a statement in the presence of his lawyers. Speaking to the Star after his release on Monday evening,
the politician said he does not understand the motive behind his arrest. "I was seated peacefully with my wife in my house and
was about to live for my daily chores when I saw eight men arrive in my house
and identify themselves as police officers who had been send to collect me,"
he said.  Nabwera said he was unaware of the
leaflets. "All Kenyans know that our NASA leader Raila Odinga has
asked residents to boycott the Thursday polls until reforms are [instituted] at the IEBC," he
said.
