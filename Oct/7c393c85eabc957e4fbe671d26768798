Embu Senator Njeru Ndwiga has asked opposition chief Raila Odinga to be a role model and accept defeat. He said the presidential rerun was transparent. He urged Raila as well as NASA principals Kalonzo Musyoka, Moses Wetang’ula and Musalia Mudavadi, whom he described as elders, to gracefully accept the poll outcome. He said the election was accountable, fair and democratic. Speaking during a press conference at Isaak Walton Inn in Embu town on Saturday, Ndwiga said the election which Raila withdrew from complied with the Supreme Court ruling, which annulled President Uhuru Kenyatta’s victory on September 1 after the August 8 General Election. He said the turnout in the repeat presidential election was good. All the forms 34As and 34B were filled properly, signed and results properly transmitted electronically and manually to the constituency and National Tallying Centre as ordered by the court.
