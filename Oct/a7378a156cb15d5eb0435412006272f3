DPP Keriako Tobiko has asked the DCI to charge Ruth Odinga and Kisumu Senator Fred Outa with incitement to violence and storming an IEBC training session. Opposition leader Raila Odinga's sister was arrested in Kisumu on October 18 after allegedly leading youths to disrupt an IEBC training session. Tobiko in a letter to DCI chief Ndegwa Muhoro on Monday said the two will also be charged with obstructing an election officer and malicious damage to property. "Upon analysis of the evidence on the record, the DPP finds the evidence sufficient to warrant prosecution of the to suspects and their accomplices. The suspects should immediately be charged in Kericho law court," the chief prosecutor said. He instructed the DCI to take statements from the complainants to strengthen the prosecution's case and assist with investigations. "Record statements from the main complainant who is Diana Odhiambo. Get p3 form on Diana who was allegedly assaulted and whisked away. Get the owner of the damaged property to state the extent of the damage incurred," he said. "Get photos and exhibits of the damaged property during the violence." Last week, Outa and Ruth vowed to thwart any attempts by the IEBC to oversee Thursday's presidential election. They said due Raila's withdrawal from the race, nobody should take up IEBC jobs or offer any services to the poll agency until there are electoral reforms to enhance credible polls.
