Despite a massive mobilisation drive, some 10,000 registered voters failed to cast ballots in President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Gatundu South constituency. His backyard of true believers. The lower turnout trend was replicated across Kiambu county, where it dropped slightly, compared to the August 8 General Election. Uhuru and Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu had traversed the populous county with the “Kumira Kumira” (loosely translating to turn up, turn up) rallying call. Gatundu South, Uhuru’s backyard, has 75,858 registered voters. But only 65,254 turned up on Thursday. In August, more than 67,000 voters turned up. This time, 65,099 people voted for Uhuru, according to figures released by the returning officers yesterday.  NASA’s Raila Odinga — who withdrew and called for a boycott — received 49 votes. Independent candidate Joseph Nyaga was third with 25 votes. Candidate Japheth Kaluyu got 24. Thirdway Alliance leader Ekuru Aukot had 22, Michael Mwaura 16 and Cyrus  Jirongo got eight.  The turnout was better in neighbouring Gatundu North with 87 per cent. A total of 58,600 people voted.  The constituency has 67,598 registered voters. Results showed 58,387 voted for Uhuru, and 41 for Raila. The most disappointing voter turnout was in Kikuyu constituency, where only 75.6 per cent of people voted, compared to highs of 85 per cent in the rest of Kiambu. Out of 91,157 voters, Uhuru got 72,022, with Raila coming second with 311 votes. Kiambu Town constituency has 80,811 voters, of whom 64,707 voted. Uhuru garnerered 64,034 from the constituency and Raila got 313. In Limuru, of 87,258 registered voters, only 70,830 cast ballots. Uhuru got 69,912 and Raila got 408 votes. Results from other Kiambu constituencies were being tallied on Friday.  Results of the presidential election rerun started to trickle in on Friday, with early estimates of the turnout at below 35 per cent across Kenya.  IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati tweeted overnight that 6.55 million ballots had been cast.  This translated to just 34.5 per cent of the total registered voters.  By contrast, turnout in the August election was 80 per cent. This could deal a blow to the President’s hopes for a decisive second-term mandate. With nearly all followers of Raila heeding boycott call, Uhuru’s victory was never in question.
