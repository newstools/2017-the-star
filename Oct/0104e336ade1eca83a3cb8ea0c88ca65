Kisumu Deputy Governor Mathews Owili on Saturday condemned the looting of Tumaini Supermarket (pictured) during the anti-IEBC protest on Friday. He said it will scare away potential investors. Owili said the looting should be treated as a crime and not part of a peaceful demonstration. â€œWe are asking police to protect property. Those businesses employ many people,â€ he said. He spoke during interdenominational prayers at Jomo Kenyatta sports ground.
