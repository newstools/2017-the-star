President Uhuru Kenyatta garnered more votes in Thika Town constituency in Thursday’s presidential rerun than in the August 8 General Election. In the final tally announced by Thika returning officer Geoffrey Gitobu on Friday morning, Uhuru garnered 99,517 votes of the 102,989 votes cast — 98 per cent. In the August polls, the President got 96,856 votes (83.7 per cent). He improved by 2,661 votes, a 2.5 per cent increase. This was despite a low turnout (69.2 per cent) blamed on heavy rain that kept many residents from voting. NASA chief Raila Odinga — who withdrew and called for a boycott — garnered 1,243 votes, compared to 18,525 votes in August. Most of his supporters in Thika heeded his call to keep off the polls. Thika Town constituency has 147,344 registered voters. Some 997 votes were spoilt. The increase in Uhuru votes was attributed to relentless mobilisation led by area MP Patrick Kimani. Residents praised the MP for assisting voters get to the polling stations, especially the disabled, the sick, the elderly and those who had been stranded because of the rains.
