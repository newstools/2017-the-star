Lonina Leteipan, the estranged husband of Sharon Mundia, aka This is Ess, seems to have moved on so quickly after they parted ways. The hunk father of one was spotted on Friday night getting a lap dance from a female friend at Space Lounge on Ngong Road.  "Si yule ni bwana ya This is Ess? Yaani waliwachana? Enyewe ndoa ni ngumu," a top media personality was heard telling his friends. Towards the wee hours of the morning, Lonina and his mistress started kissing and whispering sweet nothings into each other's ears. They later left the club and who knows where they went to.  The rumourmill was rife with information that Sharon Mundia and Lonina's marriage is on the rocks. Neither has come out to deny or confirm the whispers.
