Londonâ€™s ambulance service said they had treated 11 people, mostly for head and leg injuries, with nine taken to hospital after a car collided with pedestrians near the cityâ€™s Natural History Museum on Saturday. â€œWe sent multiple resources to the scene, including our hazardous area response team, ambulance crews, paramedics in fast response cars and incident response officers,â€ Peter McKenna, deputy director of operations, said in a statement. â€œWe have worked closely with other members of the emergency services at the scene, with our priority being to get people to safety and ensure they received the medical help they needed as quickly as possible.â€ London police said the incident was not terrorism-related but was being treated as a road traffic collision. British media reported a car had mounted the sidewalk outside the tourist attraction, one of several large museums in that area of South Kensington, west London, and police said a man had been detained at the scene.
