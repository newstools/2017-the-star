Governor Granton Samboja has called on security officials to speedily arrest authors of leaflets giving Taita Taveta non-locals 72 hours to leave. Speaking to the press in Wundanyi on Saturday, Samboja said the leaflets which were hand written were spotted by residents in parts of Voi. "It's sad that some people in this county are spreading leaflets telling people from other tribes to pack and go," he said. "I want to be categorical that all Kenyans have a right to stay in any part of this country. Those doing that should stop this vice of tribalism. We urge our security officials to investigate and arrest the authors of the leaflets." County police commander Fred Ochieng told the Star on phone that they were investigating but had not yet made arrests. "For now we don't want to give detailed information on the issue because we don’t want to compromise investigations. However, we cannot allow some elements in the society to disrupt peace." Police are also looking into the circulation of hate leaflets in Bungoma and Kakamega county's Lugari constituency.
