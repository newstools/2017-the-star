United Kingdom-based Malcolm Onsando is the latest addition to the Kenya Simbas squad for the upcoming four-nations tour to Hong Kong next month. Onsando will beef up the second row options, replacing Simon Muniafu, who is currently plying his trade in France. Onsando played for Quins before going for further studies in England. Speaking yesterday, assistant coach Dominique Habimana said the 36-man squad will be whittled down to 26 players before departure and the team has intensified its training ahead of the tournament slated for next month. “We are polishing up the few areas which we had issues in the matches we had in the Africa Gold Cup and internationals and we want to be compete in the four-nations tournament,” said Habimana. Habimana said some of the younger players called up to the squad will be exposed to test match rugby in the tournament and prepare them for the Rugby World Cup qualifiers slated for next year. “We are also trying to build depth in certain positions and this upcoming tour gives an opportunity to blood this players,” added Habimana. Kenya face Chile, ranked 28th, Russia (20) and Hong Kong (22) in the ournament and the tactician expects very tough matches. “We have played Hong Kong four times in the last two years so we have an idea on their system of play. As for Chile and Russia, they are very physical teams who are very formidable and they will test us accordingly in all facets of the game.” The team had a four-day residential training camp this month to intensify preparations for the matches. Habimana expects Nakuru flanker Mike Okombe, Homeboyz number 8, Tony Owuor and Kabras centre Nick Barasa, who are out injured, to make their return to the squad in the new year. Habimana said in the long term, players in the national team will be training twice a week during the Kenya Cup season which kicks off next month. A final team of 26 will be announced next week before leaving for Hong Kong on November 7.
