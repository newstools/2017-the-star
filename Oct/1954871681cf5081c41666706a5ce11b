Resident Jeremiah Chokera of Athwana Ward, Tigania West, said recently two people were shot . One succumbed to injuries The other one is admitted to Kirua Mission Hospital. There are nearly 300 police officers in various area, but they have not helped end crime, he said. Chokera said no one has been arrested over the shootings. He urged Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinett to transfer police bosses because they are not working. Other residents blamed chiefs, saying that they are colluding with the bandits because they benefit from the theft of cattle. Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi assured them security will be tightened.  He was distributing certified seeds to residents in Tigania East, Kaliimbene and Mula in Tigania East. There have been a series of attacks by raiders from neighbouring communities. Murungi said more than 200 additionl police officers will be posted in the area to ensure no one else falls victim to bandits’ attack. Tigania East deputy county commissioner had a hard time talking to unhappy residents.  This was after he said their complaints of police laxity are total nonsense. He said the residents’ claims were demoralising to officers.
