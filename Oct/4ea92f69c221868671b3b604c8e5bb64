NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga should sign Form 24A tand officially withdraw from the October 26 poll instead of issuing ultimatums, Jubilee leaders have said. They were speaking in Raila’s Nyanza backyard in Kuria during presidential campaigns. President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto will tour the area on Wednesday. Former Budalang’i MP Ababu Namwamba, Kuria West MP Mathias Robi and his Kuria East counterpart Marwa Kitayama said it is unfortunate Raila has created tension in the country through demonstrations. “We want to tell Raila to be man enough and fulfill legal requirement of withdrawing from the race by signing form 24A otherwise leave us to campaign for re-run,” Ababu said. Raila’s indecisiveness has created unnecessary drama, he should make a final decision, which will not affect preparations for presidential poll, he said. Gilgil MP Martha Wangari urged Raila to withdraw from the race and said Jubilee MPs will use their numbers in Parliament to pass a supplementary budget for his retirement package. “We are telling babu (Raila) to withdraw go and retire by singing the form 24A. We will hold the election whether he likes it or not,” Wangari said. Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro and his Githunguri counterpart Gabriel Kago said Jubilee is sure of winning the repeat election since NASA has resorted to demonstrations instead of campaigning. Robi and Kitayama urged the Kuria to vote as a bloc for Uhuru, saying it is a sure way of getting development. “Raila will not offer us anything as a county. He has failed to convince his community to vote for a Kuria governor, women rep, senator and speaker in the county,” he said. On Friday, State House spokesman Manoah Esipisu said through Twitter Uhuru will only visit Kuria and not the Luo community. Esipisu said Uhuru will also visit Kisii and Kericho.
