A man has died from injuries incurred as police confronted anti-election protesters in Homa Bay county on Thursday. Wycliffe Odhiambo, 30, succumbed to his injuries on Friday morning while receiving treatment at the county referral hospital. He fell of a moving motorcycle during a confrontation with anti-riot police in Sindo. Four other victims were shot during the protests and admitted at the facility. Titus Owuor, 17, is in critical condition after being shot in the chest. William Ochola, 23, was shot in his left thigh, while Alex Aron, 25, has a bullet lodged in his right buttock. "A police officer shot me where I was hiding when they were dispersing protesters in Shauri Yako estate," Ochola said. "I was escaping from town to our house when police teargassed protesters. I suddenly felt I was shot before I fell," Aron said. Nick Odwar, 37, sustained injuries after he was beaten. "They were chasing a woman near where I was but suspected I was her husband when they hit me with weapons," he said. Medical superintendent Meshak Liru said they have set aside a special ward for victims of poll violence. "We are attending to them though they are still weak. Medics are keeping a close eye on them despite the challenges of the ongoing nurses' strike," he said. Liru said they may be faced with more difficulties on Saturday when the county will be participating in another election. IEBC intends to conduct elections in Homa Bay, Migori, Kisumu and Siaya but residents have said they will not participate. NASA leader Raila Odinga has urged them not to protest but to stay away from the election.
