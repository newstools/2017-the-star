The on-fire Master Robert Nyamongo was on point once again over the weekend in South Africa where he won the SA Defensive Pistol Associationâ€”Southern Nationals competitionâ€” in Cape Town. He downed a total of 268,16 points to beat a field of over 50 riflemen at the Outeniqua shooting Clubâ€™s George Range which overlooks the Indian Ocean. Though he didnâ€™t emerge overall winner in any of the eight stages, his consistency throughout the championships placed him in the pole position. South Africaâ€™s Expert Hein Venter came a distant second after carding 283,85 points as Expert Jaco van der Bank (292,55) settled for the third place. Master Ian van der Bank was fourth with 319,91 points, while sharpshooter Henti Huisamen (338,96) completed the top five. â€œThe training and competition too, have been very tough. For winning the championships, I am humbled,â€ said Nyamongo, the first Kenyan to win the title. Last year, sharpshooter Serge Medic was the first Kenya to attempt the championships and won the visiting international competitors title. Medic praised Nyamongo for his performance. â€œI just carried the Kenyan flag at the Championships last year, and he (Nyamongo) has hoisted it to the top. He has made Kenya proud once again,â€ added Medic. Engineer Nyamongo won the African International Defensive Pistol Association title in August and was promoted to the â€˜Masterâ€™ classification. He posted 24,92 in the first stage- Close Protection, 46,19 in the All Hands On Standards, 23,37 in â€˜Camp Ambushâ€™ and 42,20 in the fourth point dubbed â€˜Welcome To The Jungle.â€™ This gave him 136,68 points halfway the competition.
