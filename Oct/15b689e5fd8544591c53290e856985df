A few months ago, Shaffie Weru's house was robbed of items worth millions of shillings while he was in the US. They included his shoes, caps, belts, watches, all his colognes and electronics. Well, time has passed and Shaffie is slowly getting his stuff back, because he made sure that the incident did not bring him down. Just to make it clear that things are getting better by the day, The Raverend is now rocking a designer watch worth about Sh80,000. "I was given this watch as a gift by my very good friend, Joram, who is among the youngest entrepreneurs in the country. Those who stole from me must have thought my life will be miserable, but one thing they should know is that I'm only getting started and my life is bound to get better. Watch this space," Shaffie said.
