Police have stormed the house of former Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale in Malinya for unknown reasons. In a tweet on Tuesday, Khalwale said the officers arrived in two Land Rovers and two trucks. "Four police vehicles with police have just stormed my home demanding to search it." Speaking to The Star, western region police commander Moses Ombati confirmed a raid was taking place but did not give details. "Let's wait for the officers to complete the search so we can see what they come up with." Last week, the government raided business man Jimmy Wanjigi's home in Muthaiga, Nairobi, on allegations that he had illegal firearms. The raid took place after one at his Malindi home where they said they found AK 47 rifles and hundreds of bullets.
