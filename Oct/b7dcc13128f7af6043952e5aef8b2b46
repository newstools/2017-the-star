Political leaders from Kisii and Nyamira counties have promised to rally residents to boycott tomorrow’s presidential rerun.  They said they will back NASA leader Raila Odinga’s ‘no election’ call because IEBC has failed to meet their demands for a credible election. Governors James Ongwae (Kisii) and John Nyangarama (Nyamira), Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi, senators Sam Ongeri (Kisii) and Okong’o Omogeni (Nyamira) all asked residents to heed Raila’s call. “It is only Raila who can take Kenyans to Canaan. We urge our people to support him and boycott the repeat election,” Ongwae said.  The leaders spoke on Monday at Gusii Stadium during a rally addressed by Raila and NASA co-principals Musalia Mudavadi and Moses Wetang’ula.
