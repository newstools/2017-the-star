East African Community observer mission yesterday endorsed last Thursday’s repeat presidential election despite the vote not having taken place in all counties. In a preliminary report, EAC head of mission Edward Rugumayo however decried the low voter turnout that characterised the poll. President Uhuru Kenyatta was declared winner of the election after garnering 7.4 million votes out of the 7.6 million that turned out to vote. “The government should ensure that an environment conducive to elections prevails in the entire country to enable participation of all voters in the election process,” Rugumayo said. The former Ugandan Speaker said his mission endorsed the poll from the time voting began to when polling stations closed on Thursday. It did not comment on results transmission from polling stations to constituency and national tallying centres although it said IEBC officials complied with the law in counting votes. “This statement does not cover the tallying, tabulation and transmission. The EAC election observer mission will continue to observe tallying and tabulation process as well as post-election developments and produce the final report in due course,” Rugumayo said. He said his mission monitored the repeat poll in 17 out of 47 counties. It’s observers visited 192 polling stations of the 40,883 countrywide. “78.8 per cent of stations observed were in urban areas and 27.2 per cent were in rural areas. Voting proceeded smoothly in most polling stations with IEBC officials demonstrating good levels of competence and compliance with the mandated procedures,” Rugumayo said. IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati said 7.6 million voters turned out to cast their ballot on Thursday.
