Governors yesterday blamed senators for the delayed implementation of the doctors’ return-to-work formula and allowances to clinical officers. The formula was signed in March after a 100-day strike which paralysed public health services. Health CS Cleopa Mailu, then PS Nichola Muraguri, CoG chairman Peter Munya and KMPDU secretary general Ouma Oluga signed the deal. “By doing so, we bring to an end the painful struggle that we have been through,” Oluga said during a press briefing. Clinical officers were to receive a Sh20,000 healthcare allowance and a Sh10,000 call allotment. However, two months down the line, the agreement is yet to be implemented. Through a statement, the Council of Governors has accused the Senate of failing to approve the release of funds. Under the return-to-work formula, the counties were to receive an additional allocation of Sh1.5 billion for the half-year implementation through a supplementary budget from the Treasury. This was to cushion the counties during the transition phase during the implementation. The counties were to receive an extra Sh1.69 billion to be disbursed to the counties to cater for the negotiated health workers and clinical officers’ allowances for the first phase of implementation. The implementation was set to take effect from January 1. “In order for this allocation to be disbursed to the counties, the supplementary allocation must be approved by the Senate through an amendment to the County Allocation of Revenue Act, 2016. Therefore, the Council of Governors urges the Senate to consider this matter as an issue of national interest by reconvening urgently to approve the allocation,” the statement reads. “County governments do not have an extra allocation within their budgets in the current financial year, hence the stalemate.” In April, clinical officers took to the streets over delayed payment of allowances. They said the Salaries and Remuneration Commission was plotting to deny them the pay.
