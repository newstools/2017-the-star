Somalia's Public Works Minister Abdullahi Sheikh Abas has been killed after an attack on his convoy in the capital, Mogadishu.He was shot in his car near the presidential palace, local media said.Abas was a former refugee who grew up in Dadaab camp in Kenya.Dadaab is home to hundreds of thousands of Somalis who fled drought and civil war.He became the country's youngest MP last November, aged 31, when he defeated a former minister.Much of Somalia is still under the control of Islamist militant group al-Shabab, which is affiliated to al-Qaeda.The country held elections in February and Mohamed Abdullahi Farmajo became the new president in a surprise result. Mogadishu mayoral spokesman Abdifatah Omar Halane said: "The minister was killed by mistake. They opened fire on his car accidentally. May God rest his soul".Police Major Nur Hussein said that security forces on patrol encountered a car blocking the street and, believing it was being driven by militants, opened fire.Al Qaeda-affiliated al Shabaab militants often carry out attacks in Mogadishu and elsewhere in their campaign to topple Somalia's government and drive out African Union peacekeeping troops out of the Horn of Africa country.
