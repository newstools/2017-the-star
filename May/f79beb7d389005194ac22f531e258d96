Nairobi assembly speaker Alex Magelo says he will announce the political destiny of the Maasai community before the end of this week.The community needs to have one political direction by supporting one party so its concerns can be addressed, he said on Sunday.Magelo was speaking at his Nairobi home after he met community elders from Narok, Kajiado, Samburu and Laikipia counties. &ldquo;We should not allow our community to be split like wildebeests, but we need to unite as leaders and the people chart the way forward for Maa politics. I urge the community to allow me to take them in the right direction because I have what it takes,&rdquo; the former civic leader said.Other communities have united and charted their political direction and the Maasai should do the same, he added.&ldquo;We need to review the current political system and our own position. This time we need to make the right decision by supporting the party that will cater to the interests of the Maasai,&rdquo; Magelo said.&ldquo;We should work together for the political future of the community instead of playing second fiddle.&rdquo;
