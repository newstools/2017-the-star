NGO Coordination Board CEO Fazul Mahamed suffered a setback yesterday after the High Court declined to stop the government from investigating him for alleged abuse of office and misconduct.Justice George Odunga, while dismissing Fazul&rsquo;s plea, said the Ombudsman has presented a report to the Devolution ministry and other government agencies, hence the orders sought were incapable of being granted.Fazul had asked the court to stop the implementation of a report by the Ombudsman that found him unfit to hold a public office.The judge, however, said it would be against the rules of natural justice to issue orders against parties who did not participate in the court proceedings&ldquo;It is my view the applicant cannot by way of panel beating his pleading back, seek through the back door reliefs for which leave was never sought and granted in the first place,&rdquo; the judge said.He added that Fazul was aware the report had been handed over to the implementing authorities.The judge said those authorities have not been made parties to the case and to allow the application would turn proceedings &ldquo;into a circus and render them a theatre of the absurd&rdquo;.Questions over degreeThe Ombudsman&rsquo;s office, in probing Fazul, was looking into allegations against him of forgery, falsification of academic documents and abuse of power.The 38-page report by the Commission on Administrative Justice recommends to the Devolution CS and the Head of Public Service to remove Fazul from office.The commission further pointed out that Fazul has a case to answer on misuse of public funds on an unapproved foreign trip, intimidation and victimisation of members of staff.Their recommendations followed claims that Fazul, who was appointed by President Uhuru Kenyatta in December 2014, had been discontinued from studying at Egerton University.Investigators recorded statements from several people, including Egerton University officials, Nacada staff and Fazul&rsquo;s father.This was aimed at finding out if the documents he presented during interviews at Nacada and the NGO Board are fake.Fazul had protested that the Ombudsman had been served with the previous court order on November 1 last year, blocking investigations into his academic background, yet proceeded to complete the contentious probe.The case will come up again on June 13.
