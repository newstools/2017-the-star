A five-judge bench yesterday began hearing a petition challenging the viability of the multi-billion-shilling Lapsset project in Lamu county.Fisherman Mohamed Ali Baadi and other petitioners moved to court seeking the suspension of the construction, citing lack of proper mitigation plans.On Monday, testimony was heard from Lamu Beach Management Unit chairman Mohamed Somo, Lamu Tourism Association chairman Francis Dyer and marine biologist Dr David Obura.They testified before Justices John Mativo, Jaden Thuranira, Pauline Nyamweya, Joel Ngugi and Joseph Onguto at the Malindi law courts.They urged suspension of the project until the government observes environmental remedies to protect and conserve marine life.Earlier, judges declined to hear video link testimony from a fourth witness, who is in Oregon, US.The petitioners&rsquo; lawyers are Waikwa Wanyoike, Lempa Suyianka and Christine Nkonge. &ldquo;The case is about the haphazard way the government has conceptualised and executed the Lapsset project,&rdquo; Wanyoike said.&ldquo;Even assuming the Lamu Port-South Sudan-Ethiopia Transport Corridor is viable, the government cannot tell the subcomponent of Lapsset. There was never evidence-based consideration; the government did not think about mitigation. It provided for inadequate mitigation not only in Lamu but globally,&rdquo; he said.Wanyoike said the state did not consider the impact on culture, climate change and the environment, and the project started without a licence.Somo said the construction violates their rights to a cultural life. Fishermen were not consulted and the project has distorted the heritage of Lamu Island, he said.It has destroyed mangrove forests, and coral reefs, and led to a decline in the number of fish, yet fishing is the main economic activity, Somo said. Dr Obura said the project area is home to rare species. &ldquo;Land reclamation destroys marine life,&rdquo; he said.Obura said the coral reefs, mangroves and other marine lives can be replanted, but there is no guarantee they will go back to their original status as some species will have died.The judges will visit the Lapsset construction site today.
