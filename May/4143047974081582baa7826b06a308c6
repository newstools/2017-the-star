President Uhuru Kenyatta and his nemesis NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga will today come face-to-face at a key pre-nomination meeting to be presided over by IEBC chiefs.Similar but separate meetings will be held in all 47 counties and 290 constituencies between all elective candidates and IEBC returning officers.The meeting of presidential candidates, to be chaired by IEBC boss Wafula Chebukati, will take place at Lillian Towers, a stone's throw away from IEBC Headquarters at Anniversary Towers in Nairobi.This would be the first face-to-face meeting between Raila and Uhuru on electoral matters since the disbandment of the Issack Hassan team last year.The other 15 presidential candidates, including Ekuro Aukot, Joe Nyagah and Cyrus Jirongo, are also expected to be at the meeting. The National Super Alliance and Jubilee Party are already locked in a fierce war over the declaration of presidential results with the ruling coalition strongly opposed to having results announced at the constituency being final.On Friday, Uhuru rebuked NASA for threatening to boycott elections if an appeal by IEBC, challenging constituency declaration of presidential results, is successful.&ldquo;People should concentrate on looking for votes peacefully instead of threatening the IEBC and the Judiciary. If you believe people will buy your agenda, you do not have to use threats and intimidation,&rdquo; Uhuru said.In a notice, Chebukati said the meetings would also clarify legal and operational requirements for nomination of candidates as well as the qualification for each elective position.The agenda also involves sharing the programme of activities and expectations from candidates during the nomination and emphasising the role of candidates in ensuring peaceful elections.The meeting will also agree on the schedule for presentation of nomination papers.Presidential candidates are required to submit their nomination papers for clearance to the IEBC either on Sunday or Monday next week.The papers will be received at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre.However, the clearance of county assembly aspirants as well as their parliamentary counterparts will take place between June 1 and 2.Senate, governor and woman representative candidates have to submit their nomination papers for clearance to the commission&rsquo;s returning officers at the county level between May 28 and June 2.
