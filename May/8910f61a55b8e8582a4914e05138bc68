NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga yesterday said the opposition will conduct a parallel vote count at all polling stations to thwart any rigging schemes by Jubilee.He said his agents will simultaneously count the votes alongside the IEBC presiding officers in every polling station to &ldquo;make sure every vote is accounted for&rdquo;.&ldquo;When they count, we will also count ours, they drop we also drop. If we don&rsquo;t agree we tell them no until all the votes cast are accounted for,&rdquo; Raila told supporters at a rally in Isiolo.In a multi-pronged approach to protect votes, Raila said NASA will avail at the polling stations its parallel voter&rsquo;s register to ensure ghost voters and the dead do not vote.He said NASA will request the IEBC to give them copies of voter&rsquo;s registers for all the polling stations.Raila said the opposition will put up five-member committees in each polling station to coordinate the voting process and avert any rigging schemes.The committee will be in charge of NASA&rsquo;s register to make sure the sick in hospital beds are ferried to polling stations.It will consist of a chairman, secretary, treasurer, and women and youth representatives. &ldquo;By nine in the morning, the committee will check the names of those who have not voted, go to the villages and even hospitals and bring those who have not voted to cast their vote. They will then be taken back to hospital,&rdquo; Raila said.The opposition captain asked voters to take time and verify their registration details in the IEBC registers.Raila said Jubilee has hatched a plot with the IEBC to delete some names.&ldquo;We know they want to expunge names from the register, but this time we are enlightened and brighter.&rdquo;NASA announced plans to deploy 44,000 video and still cameras across the country to enable real time relay of election results from polling stations.
