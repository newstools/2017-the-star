Bad memories haunt Bryan Kiriambu, 27, after he lost his wife, 25, and son, 2, in a bandit attack in Baringo county.Armed Pokot bandits laid retaliatory attacks at Mukutani Full Gospel Church in Baringo South on March 14, killing nine people, including his family.Speaking to the Star on May 9, the heartbroken Ilchamus youth said he and his four-year-old child survived the attack.He said he and his wife used to run a posho mill and a kiosk at Mukutani trading centre.&ldquo;Hell broke loose during the attack and I suddenly lost everything precious in my life, including my beloved family,&rdquo; Kiriambu said.Mukutani centre is currently a ghost town. It was deserted after the bandits drove away over 1,500 livestock, looted shops, torched over 100 houses and displaced over 800 Ilchamus residents.LIVING A DOG&rsquo;S LIFEKirimabu is among the residents now living a dog&rsquo;s life in temporary tents at Eldume AIC Church in Marigat, Baringo South.&ldquo;Back home, I used to juggle between business and farming, but here in a tent, my hands are tied and I cannot find land any more to cultivate,&rdquo; Kiriambu said, adding that his future now seems to be thwarted.He said he is not used to living in a tent and now during the rainy season, he watches as dirty, muddy water sweeps into the rooms, destroying his belongings.&ldquo;With the kind of congestion here in the camp, we expect an outbreak of diseases like cholera anytime, as there are no signs of accessing clean environment and water any time soon,&rdquo; he said, also fearing that lack of toilets might trigger ailments.He says he is yet to get to terms with the hard, hand-to-mouth life, as he and his young boy now survive on donations of food, clothing and shelter.Mukutani assistant chief Wilson Oletapi is equally bitter and traumatised after losing his six-month pregnant wife and a three-year-old son during the Full Gospel Church attack.&ldquo;They slaughtered my wife and boy like goats,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The Kenya Defence Forces, Rapid Deployment Unit and AP officers situated few metres away watched helplessly and could not even shoot the bandits to rescue the lives of our innocent people,&rdquo; he said.He swears he cannot go back to his Mukutani home, unless a miracle happens to keep the armed Pokots at bay.Oletapi said two police officers were also shot the same day. &ldquo;Many officers are now resisting deployment to the volatile areas in Baringo, then how can we the helpless locals dare go back?&rdquo; he said.The chief said he was left alone to raise his five children at the Eldume IDP camp, after the bandits displaced him and burned down his house back in Mukutani.&ldquo;Although I am a public servant, I am also bitter for losing my family to people I know very well,&rdquo; the chief said as he bent to receive relief food donated by the Kenya Red Cross on May 9.On May 8, the armed Pokot bandits attacked at Lomoiwe village Mochongoi, Baringo South, and shot class six pupil Bernard Boiwo, 12, on the thigh.POLICE INACTIONMochongoi chief Patrick Kamerey said residents fear for their lives. He said more than 400 residents have fled the area and are now camping at Kabel, Tuiyotich and Karne, where they live by the mercies of well-wishers to meet their basic human needs.Kamery said the affected villages are Arabal, Chebinyiny, Kabel, Kamuryan, Kapkechir, Lomoiwet, Nyimbei, Tuiyotich and Sampaka, adding that schools were closed during the bandits&rsquo; attacks.He urged the government to set up police posts and deploy more security officers to avert further attacks.Resident Elizabeth Kabon told the Star she is housing 10 displaced families but does not have enough food to feed them all. She asked the government to give them food.In Baringo North, some 10,000 Tugen residents have fled their homes in the volatile villages of Yatya, Kagir, Chemoe, Ng&rsquo;aratuko and Natan, and are now spending in temporary IDP camps in Kapkomon, Chapin, Sibilo and Bartule. Suspected armed Pokot bandits shot dead a 13-year-old class six boy at Kosile Primary School, Kiptuisang Lemugan, as well as herder Endao Ageno.Loruk sub-chief Samuel Kamuren said the bandits drove away more than 600 goats towards Seretion in Tiaty subcounty after a fierce exchange of fire with the Kenya Police Reservists.Chemoe resident Richard Chepchomei said the deadly attacks happen under the nose of security officers at Kagir, Yatya and Loruk police stations.Chepchomei said suspected armed Pokot bandits have carried out serial attacks, displacing the Tugen and Ilchamus residents.He said the residents, whose livestock were swept away by Pokot bandits, are now living hopeless lives in IDP camps without food, shelter and clothes.Chepchomei says the few remaining livestock belonging to the IDPs are also dying in numbers in the camps due to prolonged harsh droughts, lack of water and pasture, damning the locals to poverty.He accused the government of not commanding the KDF soldiers camped at Loruk trading centre to repulse and flush out the bandits.&ldquo;We thought a serious operation and disarmament shall take place but shockingly the government is just watching as people are being killed like rats and their animals stolen in broad day light,&rdquo; Chepchomei said.In Tiaty subcounty, more than 15,000 Pokot residents are dying of hunger amid droughts and ongoing security operation in Baringo, Laikipia and Elgeyo Marakwet.POKOTS ALSO SUFFERINGKaptuya chief Albert Kenimak told the Star on a tour to Tiaty that some 5,000 Pokot herders were forced back while herding their animals across the border of Baringo North and South subcounties.He said 3,400 of them are currently camped in temporary structures with their emaciated livestock at Kaptuya, while another 2,400 are sheltering inside tents at Tangulebei.&ldquo;This is the first time in history the Pokot were forced to spend in IDP camps,&rdquo; Kenimak saod.Initially, he said about 10,000 locals were affected by drought but after the herders migrated back, the number has grown to over 15,000 people.Kenimak said the helpless Pokot residents are now in dire need of food, shelter and clothing adding that the most vulnerable were elderly, pregnant women and children.The chief said the residents are forced to trek 17km to access a health facility at Churo trading centre.He said more than 500 schoolchildren are staying at home after Sossion, Matunda and Katakon primary schools were closed due to the ongoing security operation.The herders also said apart from drought, the KDF officers are shooting dead and looting their animals, loading them in Lorries then ferrying to unknown destinations.They were herding their animals in the marked disturbed areas of Mukutani, Arabal, Rugus and Noosukro in Baringo South and Kagir and Yatya in Baringo North Sub-county before the government forced them back to their drying up Tiaty.&ldquo;I have so far lost my 35 cows and 60 goats.
