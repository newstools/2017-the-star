Siaya Senator James Orengo (pictured) stunned his competitors at the ballot box when he emerged victorious in the April 26 ODM primaries after a two-day campaign.He sparked confusion after he went mum on which position he wants to run for, and only resurfaced two days to the primaries. Orengo was competing with Gem Argwings Kodhek and Margaret Oketch for the ODM ticket.The senator, who had been busy with the NASA formation talks, told Siaya residents, &ldquo;I have been busy in Nairobi to ensure that Raila Odinga becomes NASA flagbearer and consequently ascends to power after August 8. Will you vote me back to complete the battle?&rdquo;Unlike his competitors who had launched spirited campaigns flooding the county with their branded t-shirts, banners, and posters, Orengo had none.He only flew around the county in a chopper making impromptu stopovers in areas in which he is perceived to enjoy little support. The senator did not endorse any aspirant in the county and residents viewed him as neutral.On the last day, Orengo campaigned until late in the evening where he finalised his campaign trail in Siaya town.He was not seen dishing out money to residents and the main cost of his campaign was the chopper.On April 26 in the morning, Orengo was announced the winner with 140,749 votes against his close competitor Gem Argwings Kodhek&rsquo;s 9,852.He did not stay to celebrate and the day after winning, Orengo was in Nairobi organising the next NASA rally that was held on Thursday at Uhuru Park.What remains unclear is whether Orengo will use the same tactics for the August 8, now that an ODM ticket in Nyanza is almost as good as a victory in the general election.
