Hassan Joho has threatened to expose the President if he does not account for the extra Sh100 billion for the SGR before its launch.Joho, who is Mombasa Governor and ODM deputy leader, said he will storm the launch "as has happened before" if Uhuru Kenyatta's Jubilee administration does not give answersThe Governor accused Uhuru of "oiling the wheels of corruption at the expense of service delivery".&ldquo;If they think they are going to get away with the SGR, the same way they got away with NYS after swindling our money , they are daydreaming,&rdquo; he said in Siaya town on Monday when Senator James Orengo presented his nomination papers.Joho reminded Kenyans that the Standard Gauge Railway project was budgeted for in the Grand Coalition Government under former President Mwai Kibaki and former PM Raila Odinga's leadership.&ldquo;The project was to cost not more than Sh200 billion but the Jubilee government is telling us it has cost more than Sh300 billion. We deserve answers before the launch."Two weeks ago, the President secured an additional $3.59 billion from China to extend SGR from Naivasha to Kisumu. Before flying to China, Uhuru had phone conversations with Uganda&rsquo;s Yoweri Museveni and Rwanda&rsquo;s Paul Kagame on the possibility of the two countries extending the railway all the way to Kigali.As a result, the three countries will send a joint team to Beijing to bid for more funding for SGR to reach Malaba and go on to Kampala and then Kigali.More on this: Uhuru secures $3.59 billion more from China to extend SGR to KisumuKenya Railways Corporation has received an additional 17 freight locomotives, six shunting locomotives, 50 flat wagons for containers and four unit cranes, ahead of the railway's launch in June.Read more: Kenya gets additional locomotives ahead of SGR launch in JuneJoho further warned the government against taking Kenyans for granted, noting "they packed a ship at the Coast with maize and hoodwinked Kenyans about importing maize from Mexico".&ldquo;Such are the political gimmicks we need to tame by kicking this government out of office come August 8," he said, adding numerous court orders will not stop him from criticising the government.The county chief has been campaigning for ODM leader Raila Odinga, who is NASA flag bearer, and his running mate Kalonzo Musyoka of Wiper.

He warned that if they do not do this, they will continue "wallowing in the high cost of living" after the poll.Orengo said Jubilee has failed to restore the county&rsquo;s economy and that the cost of living has been high due to poor leadership.The Senator, who addressed a rally after being cleared, asked residents to ensure they Uhuru and DP William Ruto do not get another term in office.Orengo asked Opposition supporters to embrace the six-piece voting pattern, saying it is the only way to diminish Jubilee support and increase ODM support in strongholds.Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga, Suna East MP Junat Mohamed and Homa Bay woman representative Gladys Wanga were among leaders who accompanied Orengo to the IEBC.
