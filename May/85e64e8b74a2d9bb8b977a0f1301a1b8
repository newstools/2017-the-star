Kabondo Kasipul MP Silvance Osele has accused the ODM National Elections Board of foul play in denying him the party ticket after nominations.Osele insists that he legitimately won in the April 24 nominations, but some influential people within the board organised to deny him a certificate because they had already settled on a candidate.He lost to former Kenya Literature Bureau director Eve Obara.The lawmaker questioned why NEB failed to hand him the nomination certificate yet he was declared the winner and given a provisional certificate by the returning officer during the primaries.He said the party had predetermined and settled on a woman candidate, in pursuit of the gender balance threshold.Osele accused Obara of working with ODM to deny him the ticket and promised to engage her in a bruising political battle as an independent.He spoke on Saturday when he toured the constituency to check on the progress of voter verification.Osele said he still supports leader Raila Odinga.
