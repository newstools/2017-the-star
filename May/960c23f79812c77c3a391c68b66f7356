Ogiek chairman Joseph Towett has lauded the African Court on Human and People&rsquo;s rights for its ruling that the community&rsquo;s rights had indeed been violated by the government.The government had sought to kick out the Ogiek community from the Mau Forest. On Saturday, Towett said the ruling has vindicated the community. Towett urged the government to form a committee to discuss how to effect the ruling.According to the ruling made in Arusha, Tanzania, on Friday the government of Kenya violated fundamental land rights of the Ogiek community as enshrined in the African Charter.Speaking in Nakuru town, Towett urged the government to develop a framework to address how to allocate land to the Ogieks and how to ensure communities living in forests have access to social amenities. Towett called for the revocation of title deeds to large tracks &ldquo;in the hands of a few individuals&rdquo;.&ldquo;We are elated, but the government has to address certain fundamental issues to ensure the community&rsquo;s interests are not violated again,&rdquo; he said. Towett further said the ruling should be taken positively as it will help reduce conflicts between communities in the forests and the government as well as help create a conducive environment to resolve conflicts.&ldquo;The ruling positively will help us move forward and accord everybody their right to benefit from their resources,&rdquo; he said.Former Mariashoni councillor Johnson Meobi said the county government should help residents develop their plots, which were subdivided during his term.&ldquo;We had subdivided the plot centres in our areas during our reign, but the case slowed development. Now we are calling on the government to speed up the issues stated so the Ogieks can develop their areas like other parts of the country,&rdquo; he said.The Ogieks filed the land case in 2006.
