Kamukunji MP Yusuf Hassan will fly the Jubilee Party flag after his rival Simon Mbugua stepped down.Mbugua had been declared the winner of the Jubilee ticket for the MP seat, but Yusuf appealed the results, saying the exercise was a sham.Speaking at Jubilee headquarters yesterday, Mbugua said he will support Yusuf ahead of the August 8 General Election.&ldquo;After wide consultations, I am persuaded that the interest of our country and our city are more important that the win of an individual,&rdquo; he said. Mbugua said the decision is in the interest of the party. &ldquo;Of course my thousands of supporters will be extremely disappointed to hear about this. Many of them spent time and money to support my candidacy. I want to say thank you,&rdquo; he said. Jubilee carried out its nominations last week and has received 500 appeals from aspirants.Only 107 cases had been cleared by Tuesday. Appeals tribunal head Faith Waigwa said they will not accept more cases on the April 30 polls.
