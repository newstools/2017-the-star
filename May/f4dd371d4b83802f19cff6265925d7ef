ODM NEB has directed that a repeat nomination for Kisumu Central Constituency be carried out on May 16."The exercise will only be for the MP&rsquo;s position whose earlier result was contested and ended up in Court, ODM director of communications Philip Etale said in a statement on Saturday.Etale said the polling Stations will open at 6am and close at 5pm.The High Court on Friday directed ODM to repeat the nominations after Former TNA secretary general Onyango Oloo contested incumbent Ken Obura's win.The Judge directed ODM party to repeat the nominations within 72 hours faulting the tribunal for dismissing Oloo's appeal.Early in the week, Obura was declared the bonafide winner by Political Parties Disputes Tribunal chairman Kyalo Mbobu.Oloo challenged Obura's nomination saying there were electoral offences.But the tribunal did not recognise the announcement that Oloo won, saying it could not stand in law.Mbobu further said the constituency election panel chairman assumed the role of returning officer without informing the NEB and declared Oloo winner.More on this: Tribunal orders ODM to give Obura Kisumu Central nominations certificate[VIDEO] Protests after Ken Obura declared winner of Kisumu Central ODM MP pollsAlso read: New twist after ODM poll team says Onyango Oloo won Kisumu Central MP polls
