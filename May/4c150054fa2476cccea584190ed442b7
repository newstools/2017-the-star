Special teams have been put in place to oversee the campaigns.On Saturday, ODM&rsquo;s Nairobi chairman George Aladwa said Governor Evans Kidero&rsquo;s campaigns will be run by a special team from Orange House.&ldquo;This is now a party affair because as a party we cannot take chances. It has become a matter of life and death,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;We are going to meet as a party, and specifically the Nairobi branch, and decide on a team that should lead Kidero&rsquo;s campaign.&rdquo;The Star has established that Deputy President William Ruto has taken it upon himself to oversee campaigns to ensure JP candidates Mike Sonko and Polycarp Igathe triumph on August 8.Last week he endorsed Sonko and Igathe and vowed to campaign for them to ensure the seat is delivered to the ruling party.Speaking at Jogoo Road ACK, Aladwa said the team will take over Kidero&rsquo;s campaigns immediately the campaign period begins on May 28.Aladwa said the new team will come up with a clear outline of back-to-back high-level political activities.Parties under NASA could also be enlisted to vote as a bloc for Kidero.Kidero said they have put in place all measures, and will meet as Team Nairobi in coming days to come up with a solid plan to scoop the majority of the seats in the city.&ldquo;We want at least 13 out of 17 MP seats, 53 MCAs plus, of course, the senator, woman representative and governor. We also want to deliver more than 1.5 million votes to our President Raila Odinga,&rdquo; he said.Kidero&rsquo;s bid for a second term got a major boost on Saturday, when he was backed members of the African Divine Church and Muslim community.
