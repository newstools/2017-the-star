A Rongo farmer is distraught after his son was buried on another man’s land. Sylvester Onyango had not paid the boy’s mother’s dowry. On Monday, Onyango, from Aila village in Rongo subcounty and his family skipped the burial of his first born son, Felix Owuor, 19, at Rodi in Homa Bay county. Onyango hails from Kamagambo clan. He skipped the burial after a court order barred his plans. He did not pay the dowry when he married Okeyo’s mother. They separated after two years. He had lived with Felix for four years before he died on February 5. His attempts to have him buried on his land were stopped. He sought help at the Rongo Magistrate’s court on February 20. The case dragged for more than three months. Onyango married Benter Achieng in 1997. They separated after two years and she married second husband Omolo Were from Kanyada clan. Felix was five years old. “For the past five years I have lived with my son after the mother brought him back, saying Were rejected him. I took him back to school and he was a form two student at Rakwaro Secondary when he died,” Onyango said at his home. He said on March 29, a DNA test ordered by the court showed Felix was his son. Onyango wanted him buried at his home as his first child. “I remarried and have two wives with eight children, but all along I told my family about him. When he came back we welcomed him,” Onyango said. Luo elder Agolo Odoyo told the court that by the Luo customary laws, Felix’s father is Were since he paid three cows as dowry for Achieng, who has three other children with him. The Kanyada clan left a coffin at the Rosewood Mortuary in Rongo town for weeks, awaiting the court’s decision. They picked the body in a rush on Sunday.
