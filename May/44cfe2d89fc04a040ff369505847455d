Judges hearing cases before the High Court&rsquo;s Criminal and Anti-Corruption divisions are now required to don black robes, beginning next month.According to an internal memo signed by Senior Deputy Registrar of the two divisions, Rose Aganyo, the judges who dress in formal suits and tie are expected to dress in the black robes beginning June 5.ROBED IN BLACK and white&ldquo;Accordingly, all counsel appearing before these courts will be expected to be robed,&rdquo; reads part of the memo dated April 27.The robes should be black and the judges should wear white shirts with flaps.The directive overturns one made by retired Chief Justice Willy Mutunga who in 2011 spared Judges and advocates the colonial traditional dress code in the Judiciary, save for the Court of Appeal and Supreme Court. Immediately he was sworn into office Dr Mutunga told judges they were at liberty to either keep the traditional robes and wigs as souvenirs or hand them back to the Chief Registrar of the Judiciary.My Lord TITLE BANNEDMutunga also banned the use of titles &ldquo;My Lord and My Lady&rdquo; and directed lawyers and litigants to instead use &ldquo;Your Honour or Mheshimiwa.&rdquo;The then CJ said he had consulted judges during their annual conference in Mombasa, which was also attended by members of the Judicial Service Commission. Since then only the Court of Appeal judges have been donning the black robes when handling civil matters and red ones for criminal cases.Supreme Court judges have locally-designed robes in the green and gold colours of the Judiciary.The notice by the Deputy Registrar has been addressed to all advocates and litigants and copied to Principal Judge Richard Mwongo, Presiding Judge of the Criminal division Jessie Lesiit and Presiding Judge of the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Division Hedwig Ong&rsquo;udi. It is also copied to Justices Luka Kimaru, Stella Mutuku, James Wakiaga and Grace Ngenye-Macharia who handle the Criminal Division.Justice Lydia Achode of the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Division is also expected to adhere to the new rules on the first Monday of June.
