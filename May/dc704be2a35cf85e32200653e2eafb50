Former White House national
security adviser Michael Flynn will decline to comply with a
subpoena from the Senate Intelligence Committee investigating
possible Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election,
according to multiple media reports on Monday. He will invoke his Fifth Amendment protection against
self-incrimination, as first reported by the Associated Press,
citing sources close to Flynn. The retired lieutenant general, a key witness in the Russia
probe, planned to inform the panel of his decision later on
Monday, the reports said. Flynn's lawyer did not return requests for comment. The Senate Intelligence Committee is conducting one of the
main congressional probes of alleged Russian meddling in the
US presidential election and whether there was any collusion
between President Donald Trump’s campaign and
Russia. The committee first requested documents from Flynn in an
April 28 letter, but he declined to cooperate with the request.
Then it issued a subpoena. It was not clear what the committee would do if Flynn
decided not to comply. Senator James Lankford, a Republican member of the
intelligence committee, said on Twitter Flynn was within his
rights to invoke the Fifth Amendment of the US Constitution. “We will get to the truth one way or another,” he said on
Twitter. “We need facts, not speculation & anonymous sources.” Congress has the constitutional authority to enforce a
subpoena. A Congressional Research Service report has outlined three
main options: seeking criminal prosecution through the executive
branch, asking the courts for a civil judgment or using a
dormant power of "inherent contempt" to detain and imprison an
individual. The latter option has not been used in 75 years, it said,
with Congress more often relying on the criminal contempt
statute in recent years. The US intelligence community concluded in January that
Moscow tried to sway the November vote in Trump's favor. Russia
has denied involvement, and Trump insists he won fair and
square. Flynn was forced to resign in February, after less than a
month on the job, for failing to disclose the content of his
talks with Sergei Kislyak, Russia's ambassador to the United
States, and then misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the
conversations. Reuters reported on Thursday that Flynn and other advisers
to Trump’s campaign were in contact with Russian officials and
others with Kremlin ties in at least 18 calls and emails during
the last seven months of the US presidential race. Flynn has acknowledged being a paid consultant to the
Turkish government during the campaign.
