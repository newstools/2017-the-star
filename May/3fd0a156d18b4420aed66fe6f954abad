Raila Odinga is a hypocrite who does the opposite of what he says, Labour Party leader Ababu Namwamba has said.Ababu hit out at the Opposition leader, saying Raila only glorifies leaders who support him and condemns those who differ with him."I was in the front line supporting him and I marshalled all the support needed until he gave me the name 'general'. I was his lieutenant being glorified with all the holy names befitting an angel," Ababu said on Saturday.He was speaking in Meibeki, Uasin Gishu county during the launch of campaigns for Labour Party Senate hopeful Philip Kiyeng."However, when things changed due to lack of democracy, I made an about turn and now they are calling me names, condemning me," he added.He also cited how DP William Ruto and ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi backed Raila in 2007 and 2013 respectively."Look at how Ruto brought all the votes from the Rift Valley region in 2007 and when they differed, Raila branded him as corrupt. The same with Mudavadi in 2013. But look at how (Mudavadi) is glorifying him now because he has joined his camp," the Budalang'i MP said.Ababu dismissed NASA as an exclusive club of five men with nothing substantial to offer Kenyans.He said the Opposition team is only strategising on how to share power without service delivery to citizens."As a party, we choose to support Jubilee because of its development agenda. Though there were few challenges, they delivered and we are supporting them for another term," he said, and asked residents to vote for Kiyeng.&ldquo;He has the capability to represent you in the senate.Don&rsquo;t vote basing on the party alignments but search for leadership qualities in an individual,&rdquo;He said.In July last year, Ababu fell out with Raila and resigned as secretary general of ODM party.He cited harassment and disrespect despite his efforts to market the party under the opposition's Cord coalition.&ldquo;I have stood with ODM for many years but instead of recognising the role I have played in the party, ODM has opted to frustrate, belittle and harass me,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;I defended my party and party leader by action, not by word of mouth, and Raila Odinga is fully aware of that. My question is why they declined to give me full responsibilities."[AUDIO] Ababu resigns as ODM secretary general, narrates Raila Odinga's betrayal
