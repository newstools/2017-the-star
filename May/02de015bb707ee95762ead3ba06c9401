The political parties arbiter has barred Jubilee from issuing the Laikipia governor ticket to anyone other than Joshua Irungu. The party was on Thursday stopped from issuing a certificate, cancelling or re-tallying the polls to alter the incumbent's win. The tribunal said Irungu's win remains as was declared after the nomination until the application is heard and determined. Governor Irungu filed the application after Jubilee appeals tribunal nullified results of Laikipia North constituency polls. His ground is that he fully participated in the nominations and was announced the winner ahead of the August 8 polls. The county boss says he is now apprehensive that Jubilee wants to shortchange him in favour of Nderitu Mureithi. Irungu, through his lawyer, told the tribunal led by Kyalo Mbobu that the April 3 directive might be used to declare Mureithi the winner. "They ordered a re-tallying of votes of two other constituencies so as to announce the winner basing on the amendment." The tribunal certified the matter as urgent and directed that the party appeals tribunal and its national election board be served. An inter-parties hearing is set for Saturday, April 6, 2017. Jubilee party, Nderitu Mureithi and Sam Thuita Mwangi are the respondents in the case.
