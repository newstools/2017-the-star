National Super Alliance (NASA) pentagon on Friday endorsed ANC Party leader Musalia Mudavadi to spearhead the coalition's presidential campaigns.Mudavadi will head a team of ten highly qualified personalities seconded by the partner parties as they prepare for the August 8 general election.The coalition has also formed 47 county campaign coordinating committees that will marshal votes in the 290 constituencies.This will cascade to the 1,450 wards and eventually to the 40,000 polling stations that will be used during the elections.Mudavadi&rsquo;s role is in line with the NASA power-sharing formula where he is proposed to take up the role of Premier Cabinet Secretary."I have graciously accepted to play this pivotal role because I believe a win for NASA is a win for Kenyans.""We have little time for sideshows. We are going flat out for the Jubilee jugular," Mudavadi told his ANC strategy team on Thursday.The endorsement follows a proposal to the summit by NASA flag bearer Raila Odinga.Raila, Mudavadi, Isaac Rutto (Bomet Governor), Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper leader) and Moses Wetang'ula (Ford Kenya) are the coalition's principals.The five are members of the NASA summit and will run campaigns across the country within the 79 days left to the polls.Read: Governors &lsquo;not best choice&rsquo; to lead NASA campaignsThe summit, known as NACACO, is the apex decision-making body that will coordinate NASA presidential campaign.It is modelled on the USA Democratic Party National Committee.Mudavadi will work with experts in research and strategy, communications, resource mobilisation, operations, and logistics.They will be supported by a 24-hour presidential secretariat as campaigns officially start on May 28.Also read: Inside Raila's election campaign teamThe Amani national congress leader said the NASA team will be in Baringo and West Pokot next week.The week after, it will be the turn of Muslim- and pastoralist-dominated counties in the Coast and Northeastern regions.Mudavadi said the intention is to cover the northern Kenya regions before the advent of Ramadan."NASA will honour and respect the Muslim community by not disturbing them during the period of fasting."The message to our Northeastern brethren is that it is NASA that has vowed to resolve all issues of historical injustices," he said.He said NASA will address troubles with the pastoralist economies by ensuring they realise their social and economic rights."Our policy platform is clear on actualising basic needs of pastoralists."
