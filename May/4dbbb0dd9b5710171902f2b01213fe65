Nakuru Governor Kinuthia Mbugua&rsquo;s choice of running mate seems to have disappointed some politicians.Governor Kinuthia Mbugua declared he will run as an Independent, and named Peter Ketyenya as his running mate, after he lost to Lee Kinyanjui in the Jubilee nomination.Kinyanjui won with 216,385 votes against Mbugua&rsquo;s 150,137.Ketyenya was picked from a list of six candidates. He lost in Jubilee&rsquo;s Kuresoi South MP race to Joseph Tonui.But some of those in the list of running mate choices accused Mbugua&rsquo;s inner circle of mis-advising him.&ldquo;We hoped he would pick a running mate from Kuresoi North since he promised to have a new direction,&rdquo; former Kuresoi MP James Koskei said. &ldquo;Inside his circle we have political enemies who did not want us to be Mbugua&rsquo;s running mate and instead settled for Ketyenya.&rdquo;Koskei, who is said to have signed documents to be Mbugua&rsquo;s running mate, said he supports UhuRuto&rsquo;s reelection.Mbugua said he consulted widely before he settled on Ketyenya after dropping Deputy Governor Joseph Ruto.&ldquo;We have had good working ties with Ruto and that is why after consultations he told me he was not comfortable with a second term, hence I had to look for another DG,&rdquo; he said.Ketyenya has served in the NHIF, Kenya Forestry Service and the Kenya Rural Roads Authority. He said he is ready to work for the county.Mbugua said on Friday, &ldquo;I have consulted widely and that is the reason why, as per the provisions of the Constitution, I will vie as an independent candidate. I also take this opportunity to announce my running mate Dr Peter Ketyenya come August 8.&rdquo;Kinyanjui has appointed University of Nairobi lecturer Erick Korir as his running mate.The two running mates are from the same community and constituency&mdash;Kuresoi South&mdash;whose MP is Zakayo Cheruiyot.
