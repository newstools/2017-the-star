IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati on Thursday allayed fears that the Kenya Integrated Elections Management System (KIEMS) detects one's HIV status.This followed claims by some quarters who have been reluctant to take part in the ongoing voter verification over fears of confidential information leaks.A spot check at various stations for the past one week has revealed short queues at the registration centres, probably because of Kenyan style of last-minute dashes or as a result of the myths on the process.Read: Few turn up for voter verificationChebukati also dismissed assertions that the verification was a scheme to advance early rigging in favour of certain political groupings or candidates."Furthermore, biometric verification is not a way to share voters' details with security agencies," he said in a statement to the media."The biometric verification of voters which commenced on Thursday last week is proceeding with minimal hitches." He said the electoral agency has dispatched 11,000 kits to various centres in the country's 249 constituencies and in the diaspora.Of these 10,850 are being used internally, 138 in prisons while the other 12 are in the diaspora in preparation for the August 8 polls."For the wards, we have deployed between three to 10 kits depending on the geographical size and the population of registered voters," Chebukati said.The polls agency says the KIEMS kits' distribution formula is similar to the one which was used in dispatching BVR kits during the second Mass Voter Registration (MVRII).Chebukati said the use of biometrics for verification and authentication is a legal requirement for the exercise ending on June 9, 2017.The electoral agency boss said it represents the best approach to strengthen the integrity of voter identification in the electoral process."We urge all voters to check their details. In instances a voter's particulars are missing or incorrect, there is a claim form for such corrections."He said the form will be taken to the constituency registration officer who will carry out a background search to determine if a claim is genuine."It is critical that the voter provides correct contact details for follow-up," the chairman said adding that the commission will meet its poll deadlines.He said the biometric voter verification exercise cannot of itself detect all possible errors in the register of voters.It also cannot, without further control measures, identify and expunge names of deceased persons from the database."Therefore, the ongoing audit by KPMG is crucial towards securing the integrity of the register," Chebukati said.
