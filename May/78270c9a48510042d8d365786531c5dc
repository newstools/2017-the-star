Health CS Cleopa Mailu is part of a delegation attending the 70th WHO Assembly in Geneva, Switzerland.The assembly will elect a new director general today.Many leaders and health experts are lobbying for Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, &ldquo;being the most capable and qualified candidate&rdquo;. Ghebreyesus, 51, is from Ethiopia. He was until recently the country&rsquo;s Foreign Affairs minister. He was Health minister earlier in his career. Ghebreyesus is the only non-physician in the race. He has a PhD in Community Health.&ldquo;The world has never had an African or a former Minister of Heath or Foreign Affairs at the helm of WHO. It is time we change that. Dr Tedros not only has the vision and experience to lead the world towards achieving the ambitious aims laid out in the Sustainable Development Goals, inducing universal health coverage, but also the hands-on experience to be a supportive and credible partner to countries in their efforts to achieve them,&rdquo; they said in a statement.It is expected that Health ministers will convene meetings to discuss the Addis Ababa Declaration on immunization, the Roll Back Malaria Partnership and neglected tropical diseases.
