After Runyenjes MP Cecily Mbarire lost the Jubilee nominations for Embu governor, her siblings and supporters are split, with some supporting Senator Lenny Kivuti and others Kithinji Kiragu for county boss.On Saturday, her sister Trizah Mbarire and brother Ireri Mbarire led more than 5,000 supporters and community leaders who were campaigning for her in endorsing Kiragu (PNU).Mbarire was not at the function held at Mwene Ndega sacred ground near Runyenjes town. It was steered by her personal assistant Patrick Muriithi and her chief aide, only identified as Elijah.Kiragu, a World Bank consultant, was in the meeting and said the MP supports him but was in the US on official duty.Murithi and Elijah said they had the blessings of Mbarire&rsquo;s family and they are convinced the support of the team would guarantee Kiragu a landslide against Jubilee nominee incumbent Martin Wambora.Wambora won the primaries with 60,549 votes against Mbarire's 41,987. But Mbarire's women wing leader Jane Waroga insisted the results were manipulated by powerful people in government.Waroga praised Kiragu&rsquo;s decision to decamp from JP to PNU ahead of the primaries, as the party nominations were marred with irregularities.Last week, Mbarire's brother Dickson, who is the Kenya National Union of Teachers Embu branch secretary, joined her closest political ally Njagi Karua in leading her 300 campaigners to join Kivuti&rsquo;s team.The campaigners declared in a meeting held at Izaak Walton Inn that they would vigorously campaign for Kivuti to win teh governor elections.They said although Wambora was the JP flagbearer, they are very bitter with him because he unfairly won the primaries.Kivuti welcomed them to his campaign team.&ldquo;Today I am very excited to receive you to my camp because every politician values the number of people joining him since they mean increase of his votes,&rdquo; he said.
