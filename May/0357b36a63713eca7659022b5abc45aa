Amani National Congress has become the first party to own up to its officials&rsquo; failures in running the party primaries.Sources said some took bribes in form of cash and even sex to give free tickets or select weak candidates.The party on Friday announced the beginning of disciplinary action against rogue county officials who showed open bias during nominations and continue to display hostility against the party&rsquo;s chosen candidates.It targets officials mainly in Vihiga, Kakamega and Bungoma counties. The officials are said to have collected hundreds of thousands of shillings from Jubilee Party candidates, promising to engineer nomination of weak candidates.They also collected bribes from aspirants, promising them certificates.Party secretary general Godfrey Osotsi on Wednesday directed branches to initiate appropriate legal processes to replace the affected officials and update the party headquarters.&ldquo;It has come to our attention that contrary to the law governing political parties and the ANC constitution, some party officials in our branches have been supporting and campaigning for independent candidates and those from other political parties,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;We are a democratic party and by this action we&rsquo;re not punishing the truant officials but releasing them to pursue their political persuasions at this critical time. &ldquo;We wish them well and thank them for the time we have worked together to build our party. They should feel free to work with us if they find need.&rdquo;Sources told the Star that some aspirants lost millions of shillings to some operatives who were claiming to have the ear of the party headquarters.In some instances, the source said, sex for tickets was exchanged and many aspirants left in the cold as a result.The source went on, &ldquo;At the internal dispute tribunal in Kakamega, the rogue operatives organised to disrupt nominations to enable their favourites get a free ticket.&rdquo;In Bungoma county, the officials are accused of sabotaging primaries to have a weak lineup &ldquo;because some of them were doing brisk tenderpreneur business&rdquo;.
