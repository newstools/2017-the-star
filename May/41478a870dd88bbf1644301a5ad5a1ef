 IT seems Kitui West MP Francis Nyenze faced a rebellion back home
after his remarks that Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka must be the NASA
presidential flagbearer. Kalonzo confirmed he read of some of the
protests by locals in Kitui West on social media. Kalonzo had to
invite a humble-looking Nyenze to a presser at his Karen private office yesterday, where he pleaded with his followers to support his reelection
bid. A top official in Wiper hinted that locals might not
have been happy with the Minority Leader since “all Kambas” want
a change in the country's leadership. For saying Kalonzo was
shortchanged in the NASA lineup, some people in Ukambani believed
Nyenze was a Jubilee agent. *************  AN influential politician and party leader seems to be playing dirty with
the imminent nominations to the East African Legislative Assembly.
Reason? The man is determined to nominate his own son to the regional
Parliament. Even as he seeks a top job in Kenya, the
man wants Kenyans to sponsor his own son to the EALA? How he hopes to
push through the name in Parliament is still unclear. Some
politicians were heard to complain that if you don't have a big name
in Kenya, you cannot be anything. Sad! Corridors promises to
smoke him out. ******************  A
wealthy ODM aspirant from Nyanza caused a stir in Gracia Gardens when
he attempted to force his way into the compound, despite a police
barrier. The flamboyant politician, who was driven by a slender young
lady in dark glasses, kept on talking on the phone to avoid taking
instructions from the police. A hawk-eyed officer swung into action
after realising that the politician was pretending to be talking on
phone and blocked the car from accessing the compound. The youthful
politician moved in to the driver's seat and drove off in a huff. The
politician, who is contesting the results of the ODM primaries in his
constituency, risks being sent into political oblivion see his dream to join politics dashed, should he lose an appeal he lodged
at the party tribunal. ******************  SHOULD the Senate Public Accounts and Investments Committee wind up its
sittings and allow members and governors to campaign for the August 8
polls? While the Senate standing orders allow a quorum of four
members, the committee’s serious work may be neutralised by just
two members questioning a governor on multi-billion-shilling projects on
behalf of the country. One member who arrived late during a sitting
this week was caught off-guard when a senator kept posing irrelevant
technical questions to a governor. The county chief was irritated and
nearly told off the senator during the three-hour grilling on audit
queries. “This is just a waste of time,” the governor was
overheard telling his staff as they walked out. ********************  THE Orange party national elections board and Orange House operatives must seek proper security ahead of the Party's National Delegates' Convention. Reason? Some aspirants and their supporters are so upset
by the recent primaries that they may just attack some
officials. The aspirants believe NEB officials were bribed to lock
them out. In some instances, the same board has defied the party's
appeals tribunal, defeating logic how the two organs of the party operate.
