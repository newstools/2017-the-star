Musalia Mudavadi will be the Premier Cabinet Secretary, while Isaac Rutto and Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula will be his deputies if NASA forms the next government.&ldquo;Even as we head to the elections, we must be reminded that power is not for the sharing of the elite. It is for the empowerment of every citizen of our great Republic of Kenya,&rdquo; Ruto said.He said leaders should not be planning the sharing of positions, but rather the creation of millions of jobs for &ldquo;our young people that will change the great Republic of Kenya&rdquo;.&ldquo;As we go to the elections, Kenyans must watch carefully to distinguish who stands for what,&rdquo; Ruto said.Federation of Kenya Employers CEO Jacqueline Mugo called for responsible campaigns that guarantee peace before and after the polls.&ldquo;We humbly request the political class to conduct their campaigns responsibly to avoid tension. We need to safeguard peace and unity,&rdquo; she said.Knut secretary general Wilson Sossion said Kenyans have a responsibility to ensure peaceful elections.&ldquo;As we approach the national elections, we would wish to add our voice and call upon all Kenyans, young and old, to go and vote and maintain peace and avoid violence,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Kenyan elections should be issue-based. We would want the world to know that Kenya is one proud country whose national anthem is played in Western countries, such that when our President is not visiting, our athletes are visiting.&rdquo;The firebrand unionist warned that workers will keenly keep an eye on all political parties to ensure only those with manifestos that address their welfare are voted for.&ldquo;We would want to see all political parties customise the rights of workers into the manifestos,&rdquo; Sossion said, telling the President that this should form page one of the Jubilee manifesto.
