Anthony Njeru, a resident on Menelik Road in Kilimani, said his water was disconnected months ago, despite clearing his bills. &ldquo;I had a bill of Sh900, which I paid through the mobile money transfer on November 28, 2016. On the 30th, officials from the Nairobi Water Company came and disconnected my water, claiming I had an outstanding balance,&rdquo; he said. Njeru said the officials told him their records showed he had not paid. &ldquo;They told me the payment was not reflected in their system and if I wanted my water to be reconnected, I should pay Sh1,000,&rdquo; he said. Njeru said they later sent him an additional bill of Sh5,000.NWSC communications director Mbaruk Vyakweli urged residents not to give employees cash.&ldquo;You should pay directly to our offices or through mobile money transfer platforms,&rdquo; he said.
