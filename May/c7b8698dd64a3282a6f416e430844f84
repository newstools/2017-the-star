The Coast Water Services Board has called an urgent meeting today at the Kenya School of Government to chart the way forward after its staff rejected a new CEO.Jacob Kimutai was appointed to replace Joseph Omwange who had been acting for one year and five months.Kimutai&rsquo;s appointment has been controversial. There was a court order blocking his hiring,.Workers said he was unfit to hold public office.The Labour Court&rsquo;s order had blocked the respondents &mdash; CWSB and its team of directors &mdash; from &ldquo;unfair, secretive staff recruitment process&rdquo; for the CEO.Workers who spoke to the Star pledged to disrupt the meeting and ensure it does not take place.Yesterday, human rights groups filed another petition to force Kimutai to step down.But Kimutai says he got the job on merit. The Kenya Union of Commercial Food and Allied Workers warned against interference by Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery, Water CS Eugene Wamalwa, Attorney General Githu Muigai and Inspector General of police Joseph Boinnet.KUCFAW secretary general Boniface Kavuvi said police were wrong to arrest CWSB chief shop steward Lilian Mackenzie for protesting against Kimutai&rsquo;s appointment.Lilian was arrested on Saturday.&ldquo;We now seek your urgent indulgence to ensure that Mackenzie does not continue suffering from acts of intimidation and victimisation,&rdquo; Kavuvi said.He also cautioned the CWSB management against intimidating workers.&ldquo;We are dismayed that Mackenzie, while exercising her representative role, would be arrested by police and detained on trumped up charges,&rdquo; he said.Only the board supports Kimutai&rsquo;s appointment.There are allegations a top government official is pushing to have Kimutai remain in office. When his appointment was announced last week, the board said Kimutai surpassed other candidates during the interview and is the most qualified to hold the position.CWSB chairperson Sureya Hersi said Kimutai, the former procurement manager at Eldoret Water and Sanitation Co Ltd, got the highest score.She said he had 80 per cent, 10 per cent above the passing mark.She trashed reports Kimutai&rsquo;s integrity is questionable and dismissed claims he was fired by his former employer. &ldquo;There is no documented evidence to show he was sacked,&rdquo; Hersi said.Hersi said the board forwarded three names to CS Wamalwa, and he settled on Kimutai.Manpower Services Group, a recruitment agency, was engaged in May last year to interview applicants and forward names of successful candidates to the board for final interview.But Manpower&rsquo;s selection procedure was discarded because it had &ldquo;gaps&rdquo;. Hersi said a recommendation was made for a repeat exercise by a reputable company. &ldquo;In November 2016, Deloitte and Touche was awarded the tender. They presented their list on January 20,&rdquo; she said. On January 27, the board interviewed the candidates from Deloitte, and forwarded three names to Wamalwa.
