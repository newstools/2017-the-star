A 47-year-old man was arrested on Thursday for defiling a nine-year-old girl in Kiminini subcounty in Kitale. Area chief Mildred Chesoli said they arrested John Muthee following a tip off from neighbours. "The man has been a friend of the family and he used to support the child, which made him take advantage to defile the minor," she said. The child's father, Justus Wekesa said the girl has been staying with the grandmother since he lost his wife. He said the man had been his close friend and he was unaware of the occurrence. Wekesa said he has gone to work, while the grandmother had gone to the market when the incident happened. Chesoli asked resident to be careful with those who interact with their children. "I also warn community members against settling such disputed at home as it encourages the vice and puts children's lives at risk," she added.
