Kisii county has made tremendous progress in health services for the last four years, Governor James Ongwae has said. Ongwae said the county allocates 50 per cent of its budget to health services. &ldquo;My government has given a special interest to health. The department takes more than half of our budget,&rdquo; he said.Ongwae (pictured)spoke at Kisii Central SDA Church on Sunday when launched a one-day medical camp organised by the church. The governor said residents can now access kidney dialysis services for the first time since 1917 when the premier hospital &mdash; Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital &mdash; was established. Our people no longer travel to Nairobi and other towns to access kidney dialysis following the establishment of a 10-bed renal unit at our referral hospital, Ongwae said. He added, &ldquo;We have increased the number of doctors to 170 from 79 in 2013. Further, we have installed modern diagnostic equipment, including CT and MRI machines.&rdquo;
