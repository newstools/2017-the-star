The Jubilee nominee who beat Embu deputy
speaker Ibrahim Swaleh in the party primaries has strongly denied rigging allegations on his part. Morris Muchiri aka Collo, who garnered 2,229
votes Swaleh's 1,732 said he won the nominations fairly, and promised to even whitewash at the August 8 poll. Swaleh has opted to defend his seat as an independent candidate. Muchiri said he got a lot of
support from Kirimari ward residents, whom he said were fed up with Swaleh's 
poor leadership, allegedly spending most of his time fighting imagery
enemies. He denied bribing anybody to vote for him, saying he didn't even have cash to do so his campaigns were supported by well-wishers . Muchiri, an events organiser, said Swaleh had
neglected the youth, who are the majority in the ward, and did not fight for
their welfare in the county assembly and other forums. “I feel humbled for the Kirimari people for coming
out to nominate me in the Jubilee party to vie for the ward seat. I urge them
to once again come out in large numbers to elect me as their Ward representative
in the general election and I’ll not let them down,” said Muchiri Muchiri said if elected he will ensure that all the
roads in the ward which occupies the whole of Embu Town are improved, traders
have a conducive environment to work in and that everybody’s welfare will be catered
for. A week ago Swaleh who has declared he will defend
his seat as an independent candidate blamed his loss in Jubilee primaries on
his supporters’ failure to vote owing to unwariness, overconfidence and voter
bribery. Swaleh said his rivals massively bribed voters,
manipulated results and did all manner of irregularities which affected his
results negatively and thus he lost the primaries. He  defended
his development record arguing that he had facilitated improvement of
impassable roads in the ward, built schools, awarded bursaries to poor students
and did many other things that uplifted the living standard of the residents. He was speaking at Dallas Mosque on May 10 where he
presided over launching of construction of a sewerage network   project which is funded by the World Bank
through the national government. Ends…
