Prices of milk are likely to stabilise to between Sh45 to Sh50 in two months.The Kenya Dairy Processors&rsquo; Association attributed this to importation of 9,000 tonnes of duty free milk powder and an increase in raw milk production.Chairman Nixon Sigei said milk production has increased by 10 per cent since the onset of the long rains.In the long run, the increase in production will lead to reduction in cost, he said.&ldquo;The current quantities of powder we have can only sustain the country up to mid-June and by that time the imports of powder will have started arriving in the country,&rdquo; Sigei said.Kenya Dairy Board MD Margaret Kibogy said price correction is expected at the end of July.The regulator has been meeting with dairy processors since the government gazetted the importation of duty free powder to agree on logistics, she said.The local market has been surviving on available stocks of powder milk from the processors and supplies from the National Food Strategic Reserve purchased by the government last year.
