A UK firm Equinox Energy Capital has said it is near financial closure of its $250 million(Sh26b) 35 megawatt Homa Bay hyacinth-to-energy plant, which it wants President Uhuru Kenyatta to launch. The announcement was the biggest investment unveiled when Uhuru met British investors under the umbrella East African Association in London on Thursday. "We are making progress on our Homa Bay plant and are nearing launch. We would request you to come to Homa Bay for this event," a representative of Equinox Lord Barker said.

"...and only a few details are remaining, including the issuance of a standard letter of support from the government," he said. The peers and other business executives were speaking at a forum convened by Uhuru to hear investor plans, fears and challenges. CEO of tea firm Kericho Gold Nadeem Ahmed said he had $25 million ready for new investment in a value-adding plant on a 25-acre plot in Miritini, Mombasa County. The meeting was also attended by Bob Chestnut, CEO of Aldwych International, who are part of the group delivering the 310 MW Lake Turkana Wind Power Project. Uhuru welcomed the progress and assured investors that Kenya was fully committed to the continued removal of bottlenecks to business. Uhuru was accompanied to the forum by Cabinet Secretaries Amina Mohamed (Foreign Affairs), Charles Keter (Energy and Petroleum) and AG Githu Muigai. The president travelled to the United Kingdom to attend the 3rd London Conference on Somalia. The conference will focus on accelerating the progress of security reforms in Somalia and build on an international response to the ongoing drought and humanitarian crisis.
