Gatundu North MP Kigo Njenga (pictured) has resigned from the Jubilee Party, and will defend his seat as an independent candidate. He said the JP tribunal has not given its verdict after he filed an appeal challenging the nomination of Wanjiku Kibe for the race. Njenga, however, said he supports President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s reelection.
