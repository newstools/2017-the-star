President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Jubilee government have failed to improve livelihoods and should resign over skyrocketing prices, the Kenya National Congress has said.KNC leader Manson Nyamweya on Monday said it is disturbing that Kenyans are going hungry because they cannot afford food.And yet the Jubilee administraiton had plenty of time to plan and failed to do so, the South Mugirango MP said.He is running against Kisii Governor James Ongwae.Nyamweya said prices of basic commodities have soared and many families can barely afford a single meal a day.&ldquo;It is high time President Uhuru Kenyatta quits office because he has failed to address the high cost of living,&rdquo; Nyamweya said.Uhuru has attributed the high cost of living to the drought, and says the state is doing its best to lower prices.The Treasury was expected to table a supplementary budget in the National Assembly yesterday to help Kenyans.Speaking to the Star on the phone, Nyamweya, said the government should use state machinery to cushion people from hunger.&ldquo;The President has all the experts who should advise him beforehand on challenges the country is facing &mdash; before crises occur,&rdquo; the MP said.Nyamweya said some technocrats, especially with skills in agriculture, finance and trade, are asleep on the job, and failed to predict and preventproblems well in advance.The high costs have caused a national uproar.&ldquo;It is so bad to task experts to come up with good policies but the they are not implemented,&rdquo; Nyamweya said.He said Jubilee will be defeated by a landslide, in large part because of disastrous management of the economy.
