Afya Sacco&rsquo;s savings and assets topped Sh14 billion in 2016 from Sh13 billion a year earlier despite heightened competition from commercial financial institutions.Chairman Vitalis Lukiri said the society&rsquo;s performance continues to rise despite challenges facing the country&rsquo;s co-operative movement. &ldquo;Most of these challenges are coming from heightened competition from many commercial and financial institutions in the competitive market crowned by the devolution challenges with many county governments delaying to remit to us our members&rsquo; dues every month,&rdquo; Mukiri said. Following the decision in 2014 to open doors to the public, a departure from core membership from Ministry of Health employees, Afya has disbursed Sh8 billion as loans to members.
