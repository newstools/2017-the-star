A man who confessed to participating in the murder of the Kiru Boys&rsquo; High School principal has told a Kiambu court he is a conman, not a killer for hire.Joseph Kariuki, alias Karis, had been charged with the murder of Solomon Mbuthia, but the charges were reduced to manslaughter. He was found guilty and jailed for seven years in an undisclosed prison.Mbuthia was killed between November 6 and November 11, 2016, in a coffee plantation in Juja.Early this year, Kariuki said he had been promised Sh400,000 to participate in the murder, but was only paid Sh100,000.On Tuesday, Kariuki testified against the principal&rsquo;s widow Jane Muthoni and Isaac Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a, alias Gikuyu, who are charged with murdering Mbuthia. They deny the charges.I sell fake landKariuki told Justice Joel Ngugi that he worked at construction sites as a mason and has also been working with a woman named Damaris, to hide her identity for her safety, to defraud people of land in fake sales.&ldquo;She gives me work of conning people in selling them fake land,&rdquo; he said.In Kariuki&rsquo;s plea bargain statement, he said Damaris called him and asked him to meet her and a friend identified as Njiru for a job.After a day, Njiru called Kariuki and they met in Githurai Kimbo, Ruiru subcounty, in the presence of Damaris. Njiru informed Kariuki the job was to kill a girl who stayed at Kiria-ini in Murang&rsquo;a county and worked at an M-Pesa shop. The girl was allegedly having an affair with a married man.The job later changed to killing Mbuthia after the plot to kill the girl failed, Kariuki said.Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a&rsquo;s lawyer Kihangi Mwangi asked Kariuki whether he had been paid to testify against the two.&ldquo;Is it true that you were tortured by the police for information or were you paid to accept a plea bargain since your charges will be dropped for a lesser charge? And are you being paid to testify against the accused and were you read the terms and conditions of the plea bargain agreement in the language you understand?&rdquo; Mwangi asked.Kariuki said he was read the terms and conditions and he understood what he was signing.He said he was not being paid and he pleaded guilty to manslaughter of his own volition.Kariuki said he participated in the principal&rsquo;s killing for the money he had been promised.He started his testimony on Monday when the court visited the crime scene and identified evidence of a rope used to strangle the principal.Muthoni seemed calm during the whole court session over two days and laughed off some of Kariuki&rsquo;s testimony.Muthoni and Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a are still in custody after state counsel Catherine Mwaniki said they should not be released on bail as they are likely to interfere or tamper with evidence or intimidate witnesses.Cross examinations continue.
