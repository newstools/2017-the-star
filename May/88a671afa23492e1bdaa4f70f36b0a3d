The Luhya community has no option but to remain in NASA because that is where its interests would be best-catered for if the opposition forms the next government, analysts have said.Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology political scientist Prof Frank Matanga and analyst Martin Oloo agree that ANC leader and NASA founder Musalia Mudavadi and Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula would play a major role in a NASA government, although they were not picked the alliance flagbearer.&ldquo;Mudavadi, as the NASA founder, already played a key role by endorsing the alliance lineup and he has a lot more to do to steady the coalition, because he seems composed,&rdquo; Matanga said.&ldquo;What Mudavadi and Wetang&rsquo;ula need to do now is to mount serious campaigns to explain to residents why they are better in NASA than Jubilee.&rdquo;He said those grumbling over the lineup do not understand what is in store for the community in NASA.Oloo said it will be unwise for the Luhya community to contemplate leaving NASA &ldquo;because it is their house&rdquo;.&ldquo;Luhyas are better in a NASA government, where they are shareholders, than in Jubilee, where the formation might be in place until 2032 and they continue begging. How do you build a house and run away? To where?&rdquo; he asked.Oloo said that Jubilee&rsquo;s failure to revive the Mumias Sugar Company and the Webuye Pan Paper Mills and initiate projects, including completion of those started by the previous regime, confirms Luhyas have no place in Jubilee.The Jubilee administration has disbursed Sh3 billion to bailout Mumias, but the company is yet to pick up.President Uhuru Kenyatta commissioned the Webuye Pan Paper Mills, now called Rai Paper Mills, in December last year, but a section closed down.NASA named ODM leader Raila Odinga as its flagbearer and his Wiper counterpart Kalonzo Musyoka as the running mate in Uhuru Park on Thursday.The alliance also unveiled its structures, where the powerful positions of Premier Cabinet Secretary will be created and handed to Mudavadi, who will be deputised by Wetang&rsquo;ula and Bomet Governor and Chama Cha Mashinani leader Isaac Rutto.The Premier CS will oversee the day-to-day running of the government and be in charge of the state department of Internal Security and Administration of the national government.After the NASA lineup was unveiled, there were mixed reactions from Western Kenya. Political analysts last week said Wetang&rsquo;ula and Mudavadi got raw deals.Analyst Isaac Wanjekeche described the slots given to Musalia and Wetang&rsquo;ula as PR stunts to fool the Luhya community.&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the most popular raw deal of our time, for two leaders from the same region to get into a deal that has totally disregarded the second largest community in the country,&rdquo; Wanjekeche said.
