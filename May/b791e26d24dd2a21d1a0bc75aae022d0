Homa Bay county is gearing up for yet another titanic governor contest between incumbent Cyprian Awiti and Kasipul MP Oyugi Magwanga.Awiti was given the ODM nomination certificate, but Magwanga maintains he won the April 24 primaries and the results will be replicated in the election.Magwanga will run as an independent candidate and is seeking to team up with his competitors who lost in the nominations to unseat the governor.He told the Star Awiti should prepare for defeat on August 8.Last week, party leader Raila Odinga said, &ldquo;I have nothing against independent candidates because there were issues with the nominations.&rdquo;Magwanga told the governor not to celebrate his nomination. &ldquo;We know the tricks Awiti used to get the ODM ticket but that doesn&rsquo;t mean he will win. In fact, he should prepare for a peaceful transition after the election,&rdquo; he said.The legislator claimed his victory in the primaries was snatched from him because the party&rsquo;s National Elections Board favoured the governor.
