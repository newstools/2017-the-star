Education stakeholders are puting in place measures to encourage students to study science, technology, engineering and mathematics in a bid to realise Vision 2030.Western regional education coordinator Nereah Olick (pictured, Left) said the Ministry of Education, through its new curriculum, has laid out a raft of measures to ensure students practice what they learn in class. She said unlike in the present system where learners concentrated on theory, the new model will ensure more time is availed for practicals. Olick addressed education stakeholders at the Western region Science and Engineering Fair in Vihiga. She said funds have been set aside to promote science programmes in schools. Olick said taking up science subjects will be instrumental in helping solve emerging global issues.
