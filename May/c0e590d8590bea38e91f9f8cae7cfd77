Three suspected al Shabaab militants were killed in Wayu area, Tana River county on Monday. The suspects are said to have been part of a group behind recent attacks targeting security agents. Deputy commissioner Michael Kioni said they recovered several rifles and ammunition from the suspects who were wearing jungle uniform. "They were ambushed by police and Kenya police reservists on Monday, and killed in a fierce gun fight," Kioni said. He said the three were planning attacks during the holy month of Ramadhan. Their bodies were taken to Hola mortuary for forensic examination. NIS last Friday warned of possible attacks in the Coast region by al Shabaab operatives in the month of Ramadhan. The intelligence agency said the militants have dispatched fighters in parts of North Eastern and Coast to carry out sting attacks targeting security agents and civilians. At least eight police officers were killed in bombings last week in Mandera and Garissa. Al Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attacks.
