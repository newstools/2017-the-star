The government will continue to provide subsidised maize up to August.Treasury CS Henry Rotich on Friday said the government hopes by that time, food production will have stabilised.He spoke at the Kenya School of Government during a forum for chairpersons and chief executive officers of state corporations.Rotich said with good rains, production is expected to increase this year.The subsidised maize flour is selling at Sh90 for a 2kg packet.But most supermarket and shops shelves are empty.The government&rsquo;s subsidised and branded maize flour hit the market mid this month.Kenyans have suffered since February when prices of essential commodities including maize, sugar and milk increased drastically.The price of a litre of milk rose from Sh50 to between Sh65 and Sh70, while one kilo of sugar hit the Sh200 mark. For many, it has been a struggle to afford basic foodstuff and in some areas, this has resulted in domestic squabbles.Rotich said fertiliser is highly subsidised, but the biting maize shortage has forced the government to subsidise production.&ldquo;The challenge is that the production last year did not meet the consumption level. That is the reason we have this gap,&rdquo; he said.He said a 90 kilogramme bag of maize is being imported at Sh4,000.The average per capita consumption of maize in Kenya is estimated at 103kg per person, one of the top five in Africa.According to the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics report 2014, the country produced 38.9 million bags of maize in 2013.This left a deficit of 2.0 per cent compared to 39.7 million bags in 2012.Meanwhile, the International Centre for Evaluation and Development has signed an MoU with Campell collaboration. Through the MoU, the two organisations will support the government in decision-making and policies.The ICED is an African-based think-tank that combines research and innovation with extensive practical experience in evaluation for development in Africa.Campbell is an international research network publishing high quality systematic reviews of social and economic interventions around the world.
