Instagram is rated as the worst social media platform when it comes to its impact on young people's mental health, a UK snapshot survey suggests. The poll asked 1,479 people aged 14-24 to rate which of five popular social media platforms had the most negative effect on their users. They were asked to score each platform on issues such as anxiety, depression, loneliness, bullying and body image. Mental health charities urged companies to act to increase users' safety. The Royal Society for Public Health study says social platforms should flag up heavy social media use and identify users with mental health issues. The RSPH reportÂ warns that "social media may be fuelling a mental health crisis" in young people. It can also be used as a tool for good, the report said, and companies should be doing their best to make platforms a safe place to be. About 90% of young people use social media - more than any other age group - so they are particularly vulnerable to its effects, although it is not clear what these are on current evidence.
