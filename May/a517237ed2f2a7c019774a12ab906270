A section of economists have said the amended law &ndash; which had been opposed by Treasury CS Henry Rotich and Central Bank of Kenya governor Patrick Njoroge &ndash; was a populist move to appease the voters.Equity Group CEO James Mwangi said on Thursday: &ldquo;We strongly believe that interest rate capping is not sustainable for financial institutions. One way or another, it will have to be amended.&rdquo;Deputy President William Ruto, however, appeared to dash hopes for a review in an interview on Citizen TV on May 16: &ldquo;Our position is that the financial institutions we have in Kenya should cut down on their fat, they should cut down on their expenses (and) they should change their business model.&rdquo; He added: &ldquo;Yes there has been a slowdown partly maybe because there is expectation that there will be change of policy. But I am sorry. If that is what was being sought, that is not going to come any time soon.&rdquo;Barclays' loans in the January-March period increased by Sh16.26 billion to Sh168.70 billion compared to 12 months earlier, but net net interest earnings slowed by marginal 2.14 per cent to Sh5.03 billion.
