An NGO has asked elders in Kisumu to caution the youth against politicians who incite them to violence in the run-up to the August 8 General Election.Uhai Lake Forum team leader Mark Omondi said the organisation is training elders on how best they can take up the role and connect with the youth.Omondi said most young people do not know the consequences of political violence and they need to be educated. He noted the worrying trend where youths in the region are being misused by selfish politicians, which calls for urgent intervention. &ldquo;The elders must play their role of guiding and teaching the young generation,&rdquo; Omondi said. The programme is supported by Danish Embassy.
