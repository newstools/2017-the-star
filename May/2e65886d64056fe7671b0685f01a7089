Coast-based gospel singer Princess Faridah, real name Faridah Migwalla, is one of the local artistes who's happily married and has been able to keep her love life blissful for many years. Princess Faridah started out as a young, energetic, secular artiste, who was known as the 'queen of chakacha' back in the day, before she decided to give her life to Christ as a born-again Christian. The beautiful and gorgeous gospel songstress is now one of the biggest and most revered singers in the gospel industry. She recently received two huge nominations in the Groove Awards 2017: Female Artiste Of The Year and Coastal Song Of The Year, which was truly humbling for her. Other than being a talented singer, Princess Faridah has been married to the love of her life for almost 13 years now, and it keeps getting better for them. The couple is blessed with two adorable daughters and is still lovestruck, just like the first day they met. Faridah decided to share her secret for having a successful and merry marriage that lasts long: "Marriage is not a sprint but a marathon. We don't rush through it otherwise we will crash. Every day is a learning experience. Be open to learn, discover, appreciate and celebrate each other."
