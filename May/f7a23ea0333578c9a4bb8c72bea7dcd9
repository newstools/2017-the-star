Murang&rsquo;a Senator Kembi Gitura says he&rsquo;s confident the people of Murang&rsquo;a will not vote for parties but individuals in the general election.Kembi, who is also Senate Deputy Speaker, resigned from the Jubilee Party a few days after losing in the nominations. He said they were not free and fair.The senator said the main election has attracted many independent candidates because they believe the party primaries were unfair, and the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission will conduct free and fair polls. He spoke after presenting his papers to the IEBC offices in Murang&rsquo;a town on Monday. The senator said Kenyans risked having half-baked leaders if they were barred from running. &ldquo;Had the law not allowed aspirants to vie as independent candidates, then Wanjiku would have been led by undeserving leaders elected through a chaotic process,&rdquo; he said.Kembi said residents witnessed the manner in which the nominations were conducted, and will vote for leaders of their choice regardless of the parties they are affiliated to.The senator said this time round, the Murang&rsquo;a people want good leaders and will not adopt a six-piece voting pattern being advocated for by political parties.Jubilee Party candidates led by governor Mwangi Wairia, woman representative Sabina Chege and Kiharu MP Irungu Kang&rsquo;ata have put up a spirited campaign asking the electorate to only vote for those nominated through the party. Kembi lost to Kang&rsquo;ata. He had written to the Jubilee Party demanding a repeat of the primaries in the Mathioya and Kiharu constituencies, but resigned saying JP was taking too long to resolve his case.&ldquo;I will be the first senator of Murang&rsquo;a county to be voted in as an independent candidate,&rdquo; a confident Kembi said.
