President Uhuru Kenyatta has told Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho to back off from Jubilee projects and focus on his mandate as county boss.Joho had threatened to expose the President if he does not account for the extra Sh100 billion for the SGR before its launch.The Governor accused Uhuru of "oiling the wheels of corruption at the expense of service delivery".&ldquo;If they think they are going to get away with the SGR, the same way they got away with NYS after swindling our money, they are daydreaming,&rdquo; he said in Siaya town on Monday when Senator James Orengo presented his nomination papers.More on this: Account for extra Sh100 billion for SGR or I will stop launch, Joho tells UhuruBut Uhuru asked Joho to concentrate on justifying to residents why he should be re-elected."The Governor has been criticising our projects here at the Coast including this SGR project. He should focus on completing at least one of his own like building dykes or cleaning the city before he starts looking elsewhere," the President said on Tuesday.He was speaking in Mombasa where he and DP William Ruto will be launching the Standard Guage Railway cargo train on Wednesday."Our aim is to make the lives of Kenyans better and that is why we continue to initiate projects that make this possible. We will also be back to launch electricity from geothermal, which will make energy cheaper in the Coast so that we ease the burden on our people," Uhuru said.Uhuru who is seeking for a second term in the August 8 polls asked Mombasa residents to vote for Jubilee to ensure continuity in development and economic growth."We will come to seek for your votes, for you to walk with us because we have a vision for the nation, and we have actualized what we promised you in 2013, so do not be distracted by those who com here to insult us because we all have a dream for Kenya," he said.The President will officially launch SGR operations on Wednesday at Port Reitz where the cargo train trip from Mombasa will be flagged off.He is to make the first ride from Mombasa to Nairobi on the 120kmph train.[PHOTOS] SGR train makes first Nairobi to Mombasa trip in five hoursMore of this: Kenya gets additional locomotives ahead of SGR launch in June
