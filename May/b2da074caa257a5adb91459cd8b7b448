Nairobi governor aspirant Miguna Miguna on Saturday unveiled former Laikipia University student leader as his running mate.Miguna unveiled James Gathungu 24, ahead of the August polls.Speaking to the media in Nairobi, Miguna said they will face off the current governor Evans Kidero(ODM) and senator Mike Sonko(Jubilee) as independent candidates."We are independent candidates and we have a right as citizens to run on the ticket as independents, the same manner as parties are allowed to field candidates," he said.Miguna described his move as a spirited bid to inject youth blood into leadership that he said was lacking in the county.&ldquo;Kenyans have functioning brains. They can tell the difference between a transformative leadership and one based on impunity," he said.He said Nairobi residents should vote in leaders of Integrity and not corrupted."...And we are not afraid of anybody. They can come with the money they have stolen and we will deal with them,&rdquo; Miguna said."We are not here requesting or begging for space we are occupying space guaranteed by the constitution. we must build politics based on the integrity of leaders."Gathungu expressed his optimism at helping the governor aspirant weed out cartels in Nairobi."I do appreciate the honour and I hope we will lead the county with integrity it deserves. We have to make a choice between cartels and people of integrity," he said.Gathungu graduated in 2015 with a Bachelor of Science in Statistics from Laikipia University.Read: Kidero, Miguna share podium at Jericho SDA church, exchange pleasantries
