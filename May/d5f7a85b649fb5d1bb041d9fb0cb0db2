Envoys, under the International Heads of Mission, have congratulated Kenyans on their peaceful participation in the recent political party primaries.The group, which included US Ambassador Robert Godec and EU ambassador Stefano Dejak, want laws enforced without bias to protect voters and candidates.&ldquo;We encourage all Kenyans, most importantly politicians, to embrace peace and reject any incitement to violence,&rdquo; Godec said.The call comes after recent nominations were marred by controversy. Jubilee cancelled its primaries on the first day, citing major irregularities that led to delayed voting.The envoys urged the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to conduct the upcoming election responsibly, pledging their support and asking Kenyans to do the same.They urged the electorate to accept the results of the nominations and those of the August 8 election in line with the democratic and constitutional rules. &ldquo;In cases where disputes arise, they should be addressed through the court system and not through threats or acts of violence or intimidation,&rdquo; Godec said.&ldquo;Media and civil society should continue to play their constitutionally protected and vital role without interference or impediment. We stand with all Kenyans who seek free, fair, credible and peaceful elections.&rdquo;
