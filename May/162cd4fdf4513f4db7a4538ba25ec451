The Maasai community living in the Omanie area on the common border with Tanzania has said they are being harassed by police officers and youths from Tanzania.Speaking on behalf of the Maasais, former chief Milea Oloshorua and community leader Lemomo Tukai said their people are being intimidated.They claimed the police and youths barricade the road with thorny tree branches, and then demand illegal &lsquo;levies&rsquo; from Kenyans to be allowed to cross to the border town of Namanga.&ldquo;Since we have no direct access to Namanga town from our homes on the Kenyan land, we pass through Tanzania,&rdquo; Oloshorua said. &ldquo;Our women who use the route with donkeys are asked to pay the levy. The boda boda men are asked to pay a levy of Sh1,000,&rdquo; Tukai said.The two leaders were speaking on Wednesday during the handing over ceremony of the Sh3.8 million Olmanie Lenchan borehole to the community. They proposed to the Kenyan government to build a road that directly links to Namanga.Tanathi Water Services Board chairman Stephen Nkabashi presided over the ceremony. He said the Belgian government has given them Sh. 1.6 billion to sink boreholes to help the pastoralist community in Kajiado county. He said in partnership with Kenya, Belgium has sunk 50 boreholes. Nkabashi spoke when he inspected water projects in Kajiado.
