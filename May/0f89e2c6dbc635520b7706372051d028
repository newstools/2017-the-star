He said investigations have been launched. &ldquo;From initial investigations, this is outright murder and we shall have to send the fingerprints to the registrar of persons for identification,&rdquo; the officer said.Elsewhere, a group of armed carjackers invaded the Nairobi-Nakuru highway and blocked a fleet of vehicles before making away with a new Nissan matatu.The thugs hit the matatu from the back near Limuru town and when the driver alighted to examine the damage, they made away with the vehicle.Witness Jacob Karimi said the thugs approached the driver, armed with guns and pushed him into their car. &ldquo;Members of the public watched in horror as the screaming man was pushed into the waiting car which sped from the scene as another man took control of the matatu,&rdquo; he said.The driver was dumped in Kasarani estate in Naivasha.
