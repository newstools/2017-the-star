A 68-year-old farmer is recuperating at JM Memorial Hospital after a hippo attacked him, and injured his right leg on Thursday evening.Daniel Kaniaru from Michore village, Ndemi location, Kipipiri, said he had gone to check on his cattle at 7pm when the incident happened. &ldquo;The animal was among the cattle and I had not noticed it. It charged at me and I fell. That is when it bit my leg. I screamt and attracted the attention of my dogs before my family and neighbours rushed to the scene and scared it away,&rdquo; he said. Kaniaru said the hippo has been wreaking havoc since August last year, and the Kenya Wildlife Services has not done anything to help. He said residents have looked for the hippo during the day but have never seen it because it only appears at dusk. He called on the government to pay his medical bill and compensate him for the injury and damage to his crops. Bishop Francis Karara of the Holy Temple of the Lord Christ, Ol Kalou, said it is the government&rsquo;s responsibility, through the KWS, to safeguard lives and property and stop human-wildlife conflict.
