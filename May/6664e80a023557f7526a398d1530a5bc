Losers in the Jubilee Party primaries running as independents are a let-down, some youths from Mt Kenya have said.Speaking on Wednesday in Kiambu town, Mt Kenya Youth Caucus chairman Linford Mutembei said the primaries in most areas were free and fairly.Voters decided who they wanted as leaders and their wishes should be respected, he said.Mutembei said that all aspirants had promised to accept the poll results, and campaign for the party and for President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s reelection, but they have now turned their back on him.Secretary general Stephen Karanja urged Kenyans to back Uhuru&rsquo;s reelection and vote for those they nominated.Warembo na Uhuruto chairperson Wambui Nyutu said some politicians were rigged out and the appeals tribunal will resolve the disputes.They said they will vote for me if they find my name in the ballot paper,&rdquo; he added.But Burugu urged aspirants to support JP and said the primaries were fair.
