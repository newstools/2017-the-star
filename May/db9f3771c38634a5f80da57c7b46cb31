Former ODM Budalang&rsquo;i MP hopeful Andrew Nakitare has accused Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong of interfering with nominations to support his favourite.He said on Friday that the county boss compromised the nomination results to enable former MP Raphael Wanjala to win.&ldquo;I won the ODM nomination clean but was technically rigged out in favour of someone else. I&rsquo;ve not given up my dreams and aspirations,&rdquo; Nakitare said.He said he is still in the race as an independent.Nakitare said he cherished ODM but the unfair nominations meant that he had to seek an alternative way to allow the voice of the voters to be heard and respected.He said the primaries were not free and fair, hence, his decision to stay put in the race. Nakitare also criticised Ojaamong for reneging on his pledge to unite all aspirants after the nominations.&ldquo;He has failed to do so and has avoided meeting with us. Ojaamong, as the county&rsquo;s devolution father, had promised us prior to the nomination that he will meet us to chart the way forward as far as unity is concerned,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Our efforts to meet him have hit a snag. This amounts to a betrayal of Budalang&rsquo;i constituents.&rdquo;Nakitare told politicians to emulate his brand of politics by preaching peace and unity.&ldquo;As individuals aspiring for leadership, we should be at the forefront in promoting peaceful co-existence.&rdquo;
