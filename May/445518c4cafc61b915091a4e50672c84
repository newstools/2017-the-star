The Kenya Defence Forces should rethink its recruitment policies when it comes to women. Reports of prospective women recruits being turned away in Lamu and elsewhere, apparently with the tacit backing of the surrounding communities, (See Page 31) are unacceptable.The KDF needs all the different strengths and competences that all Kenyan men and women have to offer as members of the disciplined forces.The women of Lamu and elsewhere should not be discriminated against on a gender basis when it comes to recruitment in the Army, Navy and Air Force.In world powers like the USA, UK and Israel, women soldiers are an integral part of the armed forces, including combat and support units.The KDF should recruit more, not less, women, and begin to do so with immediate effect.Turning away women in Lamu and elsewhere is a dumb move that shuts out diverse types of people and the talents and expertise that they have to offer the Army.
