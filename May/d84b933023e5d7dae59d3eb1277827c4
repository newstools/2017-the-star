The National Super Alliance (NASA) has asked telecommunication firms to provide IEBC with encrypted SIM cards that cannot be hacked.They demanded that Safaricom, Airtel and Telkom provides interfaces that will ensure transparent, accountable and quality August poll results.Musalia Mudavadi, NASA Pentagon member, said they want all SIM's International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) used for relaying results registered.The opposition team made the fresh demands to the Independent Electoral Boundaries Commission in a statement on Saturday."The Election Laws require the transmission of results from polling stations to respective tallying centres for the presidential elections by electronic means.""It is the responsibility of the commission to ensure this legal requirement is upheld without any alterations whatsoever," Mudavadi said.He added that each polling station should receive only one SIM for the transmission of poll results."IEBC must ensure all SIM cards and their associated IMEIs registered in accordance with Communications Authority of Kenya requirements," he said.He said this should be made available for inspection by all political parties with presidential candidates.Musalia said IEBC must apply to the CA for allocation of numbers unique to each zone with each having its own mobile destination code.The opposition wants the IEBC to zone the country and distribute polling stations equally to the three operators."The operators, working with all stakeholders, must deploy a hybrid of technologies to deliver an all-round electronic transmission of results," the Amani leader said."All mobile network providers must in their contracts clearly state that no more than one SIM card shall be provided for the same number."NASA expects the electoral agency to immediately act to implement the proposals.The opposition team urged the polls body to work with CA on how to circumvent challenges posed by the limited 3G network in the country.Only 15% of the country&rsquo;s land mass has 3G signal coverage translating to just a handful of polling stations."NASA wishes to bring to IEBC's attention of the looming danger of not achieving electronic transmission as required by law."Read: IEBC 2017 election transmission plan to reduce disputes
