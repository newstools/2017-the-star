Nairobi Senator hopeful Gabriel Bukachi wants ODM stopped from issuing the nomination certificate to lawyer Edwin Sifuna.He moved to court on Tuesday to challenge the plan by ODM after the request by the party leadership that he steps down for Sifuna.Chapia wants the court to issue restraining orders to the party until the petition is heard and determined.He also wants ODM compelled to prove beyond doubt that Sifuna is a member of the party.The petitioner wants this to be mirrored on the list they submitted and published in the Kenya Gazette notice.He also sought that the party be barred from presenting Sifuna as their Nairobi senator candidate in any private or public meeting.Bukachi argues that he had previously been issued a valid nomination certificate as an unopposed candidate."The decisions, actions, and omissions of ODM party are blatantly unlawful for being in violation of Articles 38, 81 and 90 of the Constitution."He says the move is contrary to provisions of Section 3 of the Political Parties Act, the ODM constitution and the party's elections and nomination rules.He argued that his purported replacement borders on gross act of impunity and utter discrimination."To prevent the petition from being rendered nugatory and to protect the applicant from prejudice, the orders sought should be granted forthwith," his lawyer Kibe Mungai said.He said the political rights of Bukachi and his supporters will be irredeemably violated unless the orders sought are granted.Read: Chapia, lawyer Sifuna in tussle over ODM Nairobi Senator ticketSifuna was trounced in the just concluded nominations in his Kanduyi backyard, Bungoma county before he declared interest in becoming the next Nairobi senator after August 8 polls.
