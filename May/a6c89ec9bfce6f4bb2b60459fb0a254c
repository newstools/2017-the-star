A dispute between a Catholic priest and nuns over the ownership St Mary&rsquo;s Hospital in Naivasha took a twist in court as the nuns accused the missionary of trying to short-change them and trying to convert the property into his name.In submissions filed at the Land and Environment Court in Nakuru, the sisters claim that the three parcels &mdash; two in Nairobi and one in Elementaita &mdash; were bought through money that was donated by well-wishers abroad.&ldquo;The funds were directed by the donors abroad to the Assumption Sisters to buy the parcels of land and construct the properties in Nairobi and Elementaita,&rdquo; their submissions state.The nuns said that the priest, Dr Bill Frydah, had admitted that he did not buy the land using his money but used donations, and therefore does not own the land.Fryda was sent by the Maryknoll Fathers and Brothers from New York as a missionary to channel funds in the construction of the hospital and is in no way the owner of the multi-million-shilling facility.They say it will be unjust if the court appoints Frydah as the manager of the property as he wants.The hospitals in the dispute are valued at Sh3 billion and are located in Nairobi&rsquo;s Lang&rsquo;ata and Elementaita, Nakuru county.The Assumption Sisters claim they own the entire land housing the hospitals, but the Dr Fryda maintained he bought the land using donor funds.Dr Fryda was suspended from priesthood in 2009 after he refused to obey an order by the superior general to have an independent audit of the hospital, saying that the hospital belonged to the Assumption Sisters and Nuns and anyone interested in the audit had to contact the Superior General of ASN.The money was collected in New York by Maryknoll Fathers and Brothers then channelled into a bank account for Maryknoll Fathers and Brothers Africa regional account. It was later transferred to Fryda in Kenya for the construction of the hospitals and learning institutions.Dr. Fryda said the property is not owned by sisters or any other person but by the Catholic trust.He said some individuals are fighting him to take advantage and convert the property to their names.Fryda added that he wants the property to remain under the Catholic trust and not owned by the nuns as they claim.The case will be mentioned on June 12.
