Bungoma Governor Kenneth Lusaka has asked his rivals to prepare for a bruising duel, saying he has initiated development projects in the county.Lusaka said that he has done a lot to improve roads, health, agriculture and education.He said this has led to Bungoma being placed in the second position in counties performance by the Infotrak.Three aspirants are seeking to unseat the former Livestock ministry Permanent Secretary .They are Alfred Khangati of ODM, Stephen Mutoro of ANC and Ford Kenya's Wycliffe Wangamati.The governor spoke on Wednesday in Kabuchai, when he distributed topdressing fertiliser to farmers.Lusaka said for the last four years, he has transformed Bungoma, despite the teething hiccups he faced.Lusaka said his rivals have resorted to abusing him on various platforms, instead of selling there agendas and manifestos to residents.His opponents have often accused Lusaka of allowing massive graft in various dockets of his government, in most case referring to the wheelbarrow scam."Even if they abuse me, I will continue to serve my people who have faith in me. I will not trade insults with them, because residents did not elect me to abuse anyone, but to serve them," Lusaka said.The governor said as elections near, elected leaders should keep to their lanes and and tell the wananchi what they have done for them."Being the first governor with no reference point, I have done a lot to transform this county and all the nine constituencies," Lusaka said.''In Chwele, we have a chicken slaughterhouse and we have constructed roads, but surprisingly you find someone standing at Chwele market at night calling to a friend on the phone to say Lusaka has done nothing on the ground, while using the street lights we have installed.''He said even if someone does not like his height or his face, he or she should appreciate the work he has done for the time he has been in office. Lusaka urged the youths in Western region not to be used by politicians to cause mayhem during campaigns.The governor, who is the Jubilee pointman in Western, said with the work the party has laid down on ground, it will win most of the seats in Bungoma and the Western region.
