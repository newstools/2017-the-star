Balambala MP Abdikadir Aden has told residents to reject Omar Shurie, his sole opponent, terming him &ldquo;a project imposed on the people&rdquo;.Aden accused the Abduwak Clan Council of Elders and a few other powerful individuals from the area of influencing the appointment of aspirants for various posts late last year. He spoke in Balambala town on Wednesday.Aden said he is confident he will defeat Shurie in August. Shurie was picked by the elders in last year&rsquo;s &lsquo;negotiated democracy&rsquo;. Others are Ali Korane to run for governor, National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale (Garissa Township MP), Barre Shill (Fafi MP) and Subow Gure for Garissa woman representative.Abdikadir said the endorsement of Shurie was meant to serve the selfish interests of his &ldquo;masters&rdquo;.Aden, who is also the ODM national organising secretary, declined to step down in favour of Shurie last year. &ldquo;As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, there is no contest in Balambala. He is a candidate who is being imposed on the people and in August, I will hand him a humiliating defeat that he will live to remember,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;You can take this to the bank: That my opponent will not even garner 20 per cent of the votes. I will beat him by more than 80 per cent.&rdquo;Aden is from the Rer Yahya subclan, while Shurie hails from the Rer Gulled subclan. The two are among the seven subclans that form the Abduwak clan.Two weeks ago, Shurie exuded confidence about winning the seat and said Jubilee will sweep all the elective positions in the county.
