The National Youth Service is in the spotlight again after details emerged that two officers suspended for alleged irregular procurement are still at the organisation.The two &mdash; Peter Muritu and Timothy Ndekere &mdash; were charged alongside Dr S Mutunga, FM Karanja and Regina Mungai for failing to undertake a technical evaluation to approve the supply of Sh47.6 million training materials.They were members of the Technical Evaluation Committee.The tender was awarded to Blue Star Enterprises.However, more than eight months later, the officers are yet to quit office.&ldquo;Timothy Ndekere and Peter Muritu were charged in court in October 2016 but action towards their interdiction is yet to be taken, which is against the regulations,&rdquo; a source at NYS told the Star.The Star established that Muritu and Ndekere are currently attending a management course at the Kenya School of Government in Mombasa.In addition, queries have been raised over parallel consultants who were brought on board at the NYS headquarters as policy advisers.The consultants were to work hand-in-hand with those in the legal, ICT and auditing departments.Other retired officers, one based at Gilgil NYS College and another in the NYS head office registry section, are yet quit office, despite attaining the mandatory retirement age.Gilgil NYS College Commandant Isaac Ndirangu, Philip Tanui and Albert Too are still in office, despite officially having been retired from the service.In November 2015, then Devolution CS Anne Waiguru resigned, citing medical reasons. But this was after pressure in the heat of a public outcry calling for her exit from office following a series of graft allegations in her ministry.The National Assembly Public Accounts Committee investigated the graft allegations and adopted the report after investigations into the multi-billion-shilling theft at the National Youth Service and the Devolution ministry.The report recommended Waiguru be barred from holding public office, but this is yet to be implemented after she was allowed to run for Kirinyaga governor.Other people charged in the scandal include former NYS senior deputy director general Adan Harakhe and former chairman of the Ministerial Tender Committee Hassan Noor Hassan.Hassan was charged alongside eight members of the committee for authorising the use of restricted tendering above the stipulated threshold.
