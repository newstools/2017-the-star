The team vetting 15,082 political aspirants for integrity and suitability concludes its work tomorrow.The government has warned aspirants with questionable integrity or dubious academic certificates to prepare for shock as they will be locked out of the August 8 polls.The seven-member panel will submit a report on the suitability of each of the hopefuls to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission.IEBC commissioner Roselyne Akombe yesterday told aspirants the electoral agency will use the report to clear or bar aspirants from election.She said the commission will write to all its returning officers countrywide to reject candidates who will fail the vetting test. &ldquo;The multi-agency team is currently going on with the vetting process. Their report will guide the commission on clearance of all aspirants,&rdquo; she told aspirants at a meeting in Nairobi.Agencies and offices involved in vetting are the Commission on University Education, the Attorney General, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Department of Immigration and Registration of Persons, the Directorate of Criminal Investigations, the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission and the IEBC.The agency is examining whether the hopefuls possess the academic qualifications and integrity to run for public office.Yesterday, the Star established the agency had been expanded with more forensic experts to speed up the vetting. &ldquo;Yes, we requested some officers, who are experts in some field, to help us process some documents,&rdquo; a source leading the team said.The team had been working from the Nairobi Safari Club, but was moved to an undisclosed location. A number of aspirants, including Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho and Kapsaret MP Oscar Sudi, are battling cases over forgery of academic certificates.Presidential aspirants, governors and all their running mates are required to hold at least a university degree from a recognised institution. MPs and senators require a post-secondary certificate. The stringent vetting process could see a number of aspirants barred.However, there is debate whether the IEBC has a mandate to bar those with pending court cases, given the presumption of innocence. The law states that someone can only be barred holding public office if all appeal options have been conclusively explored.
