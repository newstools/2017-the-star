The first consignment of maize from Mexico arrived in the country yesterday.According to the Cereal Millers Association, the second vessel will get to the Port of Mombasa in three weeks.It will ease the prices of maize flour which have skyrocketed to Sh150 for a two-kilo packet in the last six months.In a statement, CMA chairman Nick Hutchinson said the maize will cost between Sh3,500-Sh4,400 per 90kg bag, but only a small number of millers will have access from the first vessel.But Kenyans should not celebrate yet since not all millers will have a share of the imported maize. The majority of millers will still continue purchasing from the market where a 90kg bag of maize is selling at between Sh4,300 and Sh4,500. This, according to Hutchinson, means Kenyans will continue to bear with the high cost of unga for another two months, &ldquo;until adequate imported grain stocks are distributed across all the mills, which is expected to be in late June/early July&rdquo;.Hutchinson said when this happens, only then will the prices reduce to between Sh125 &ndash; Sh135 per two-kilo packet. &ldquo;The lack of sufficient grain in the market, along with the high prices being paid for what is available, are factors responsible for increases in the ex-mill price of maize. &ldquo;The shortage of maize flour in the market is resulting in incremental price increases on the retail shelf,&rdquo; he said.The supply of Ethiopian maize has slowed down further over the past week, with the limited quantity available trading at Sh4,200 and Sh4,400 per 90 kg bag. Zambian maize is expected to be priced at similar levels but has yet to begin moving out of Zambia. &ldquo;We hope that all the value chain players, including traders, grain handlers, transporters, distributors, wholesalers and retailers join our members in passing on the reduced prices to consumers, offering them a reprieve from the current high prices,&rdquo; the chairman said.In February, the government released 450,000 bags of maize from the Strategic Food Reserve to millers at a price of Sh3,000 per 90kg bag. The maize temporarily enabled the reduction in retail maize flour prices from between Sh145 and Sh155 per two-kilo packet to Sh119 and Sh130 per packet.
