The Kenyan damsel who claimed she had allegedly stolen Manchester United coach Jose Mourinho&rsquo;s heart has been dumped by her longtime Kenyan-Somali boyfriend, who is a scion of a wealthy businessman.Silvana Lelesit is said to have fallen head over heels with &lsquo;the Special One&rsquo; during his Kenyan vacation at the prestigious Almanara Luxury Villas in Diani back in 2010, when he was the Real Madrid coach.A close friend of Lelesit&rsquo;s whispered to Word Is that they had to "break up because for the longest time, her Somali boyfriend wasn't happy about her reported closeness with Jose Mourinho. He caught wind of it and called it quits".This decision was made when Lelesit went MIA for a week. He found out that she had travelled to Switzerland, where she was staying at a swanky hotel. One that he was not paying for.The close pal, who sought anonymity, added: "Everyone knows that Lelesit has been meeting with the celebrated coach. She is not doing too badly for herself. Heck, she even supports her family and has a posh house in Nyali."Lelesit was dumped by her rich Kenyan-Somali boyfriend two weeks ago.When Word Is reached out to her for comment, she defended herself, saying that she wanted space because her Kenyan-Somali boyfriend was very jealous and she couldn&rsquo;t accommodate that.She admitted that she has been communicating with Jose Mourinho but not on "romantic" issues.&ldquo;We have met severally and his wife is not happy over this," Lelesit said, "It really hurts but I had to end it with my Kenyan boyfriend because he was not a happy man all the time. I need space and piece of mind. It is about time I enjoyed some me time."
