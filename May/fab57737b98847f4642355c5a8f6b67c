Starring: Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Alan Arkin, Joey King, Matt Dillon, Ann-MargretDirected by: Zach BraffPremier date: April 7 Willie, Joe and Al find out that they are about to lose their pensions because the company they worked for has been sold. The three friends realise that without their pensions, their families (who depend on them) will suffer as well. When Joe witnesses a bank robbery he encourages the other two that they, too, should rob the bank that has taken over their pension funds. The film is absolutely hilarious. Freeman, Caine and Arkin are legends individually, but to bring the three veteran actors together is nothing short of a masterpiece! The film is based on the 1979 movie of the same name written by Martin Brest. Star rating: 4.5 stars
