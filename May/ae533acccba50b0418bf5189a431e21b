Homa Bay Governor Cyprian Awiti has dismissed allegations his administration misappropriated Sh200million meant for the agro-city project.This follows claims the county government irregularly paid Sh200 million to an investor without conducting a feasibility study.This was allegedly a ploy to embezzle funds as the project has stalled and the investors reportedly disappeared soon after the funds were transferred.Awiti termed the allegations unfounded and baseless, saying no cash has been misused.&ldquo;How can you pay out Sh200million without the Central Bank and relevant ministry knowing? Payment goes through the IFMIS system,&rdquo; he said.Awiti is among the governors civil society wants barred by the IEBC from seeking reelection over questionable integrity. While traversing the county on Thursday, Awiti said his government was only required to provide land for the 30-year Sh 560 billion project.He wondered how one can pay Sh200 million to an investor who had shown interest to invest Sh560 billion in the county.&ldquo;We did not pay any investor and we only signed a deal with Good Earth Power. What changed hands was a Memorandum of Understanding for a piece of land which was to be leased,&rdquo; Awiti said.He said the project failed to take off because of &ldquo;lack of political goodwill from other county leaders who drove way the investors&rdquo;.Awiti said the leaders, whom he did not mention, wrote letters threatening investors with court petitions, which led to the project stalling.This, the governor said, discouraged the investors, who then decided to shelve their plan.He said he had appeared before the EACC over the matter where he makes public the deal his government signed with the investors. Awiti said it is unfair to be shortlisted as those who should be barred from contesting over corruption reports.
