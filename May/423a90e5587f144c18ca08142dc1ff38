NASA yesterday warned the IEBC and the Communications Authority against allocating three mobile phone companies a contract for transmitting election results without involving them.Amani leader Musalia Mudavadi said the IEBC and CA should involve them in contract talks with Safaricom, Airtel and Orange on transmission of the August 8 results.&ldquo;We want to see the contract and be involved so that no fictitious figures are transmitted in the August elections. We want to know which company has been allocated which region because we have information that they have zoned the country into three. The companies should not be used to rob Kenyans of their victory,&rdquo; he said in Gusii Stadium.NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga, his running mate Kalonzo Musyoka, Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula and Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto, Governors James Ongwae (Kisii), Kivutha Kibwana (Makueni) and Okoth Obado (Migori) were present.Wetang&rsquo;ula warned China that any contracts entered with the Jubilee administration will be looked at afresh when NASA takes power.He said the Sh370 billion signed by President Uhuru Kenyatta in China recently to extend the Standard Gauge Railway to Malaba is a rip-off.&ldquo;We will review all deals between Kenya and China to see whether they benefit Kenyans and if Kenyans got value for their money. If they were corruptly entered, NASA will abrogate them,&rdquo; Wetang&rsquo;ula said.Raila told Kisii residents who braved a heavy downpour to listen to them that presidential election results announced at the constituency tallying centres will be final and there will be no compromise.&ldquo;We will not allow compromised elections. When the IEBC will be doing their counting, tallying and transmission of election results, NASA agents will also do the same so we compare their figures with ours,&rdquo; he said.Ongwae said the entire Gusii region &mdash; Kisii and Nyamira &mdash; is a NASA zone and not swing counties as claimed by Jubilee.Raila said Jubilee has no choice but to pack in readiness for relinquishing power because Kenyans are tired of corruption, high cost of living, collapsing economy and tribalism.&ldquo;They promised to reduce the cost of living, but life has become unbearable for the common mwananchi,&rdquo; he saidRaila maintained that they will have a parallel tallying centre.Kalonzo told Uhuru to understand that the whole world is aware that Kenya will have a change of leadership.Rutto blamed the high cost of living on corruption presided over by the Jubilee administration.
