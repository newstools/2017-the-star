President Uhuru Kenyatta has cautioned Kwale governor nominee Chirau Mwakwere against lying to residents about land and mineral issues in the county.Uhuru said Mwakwere should be the last person to pretend he cares about the interests of locals in regard to land and minerals.He asked the former minister to respect himself and stop making unfounded claims about Jubilee leadership.&ldquo;He has been going round claiming Salim Mvurya (Kwale Governor) joined Jubilee to steal the resources of Kwale people,&rdquo; Uhuru said on Thursday.&ldquo;Stop the propaganda because we can expose you easily since we have your records. Do not forget we have all the records of all previous governments and we know what you are."The President, who spoke at Lunga Lunga, said it was Mwakwere who signed away the rights of the people when he was the minister in charge of environment.Read: Raila, Kalonzo have interests in Sh5.4 trillion mineral deposits in Kwale - Jubilee leadersMore on this: Mvurya did not join Jubilee to grab Kwale land - UhuruMwakwere was appointed ambassador to Tanzania after losing his bid for senator in the 2013 general elections.He said when Jubilee came into power, leaders cancelled one of the contracts issued illegally to a company to exploit the minerals of Mrima Hills.Uhuru, DP William Ruto, Mvurya and other leaders who spoke during the meeting described Mwakwere as an ungrateful person.Ruto accused Opposition leaders of being responsible and putting the interests of residents in jeopardy, while pretending to care about them.&ldquo;Minerals will not be taken from Kwale without due process being followed and without taking into consideration the interests of the people,&rdquo; the DP said.The two leaders said the government has worked for the people of Kwale wholeheartedly.They spoke after launching the construction of the Lunga Lunga to Vanga road, which perennially posed transport challenges.Knut chair Mudzo Nzili cautioned the Opposition against creating false narratives about the education sector.Nzili said there have been attempts to make false claims that some schools have not received funding from the government. He said such reports are unfounded and that any institution with a problem should contact the union or reach the Education CS Fred Matiang'i.Nzili also rejected attempts by the Opposition to "create similarly false stories about the TSC not implementing the CBA with teachers".&ldquo;I want all peace-loving Kenyans, and even politicians who like threatening chaos, to know the CBA is being implemented,&rdquo; Nzili said.Mvurya and Deputy Governor Fatuma Achani termed Mwakwere hypocritical.The Governor said the land where the Kwale County Assembly is being constructed was recovered from the former minister and it surprises him that he has the audacity to point fingers at other people.Achani said the former minister was rejected by the people of Kwale before and he will face the same fate this time.Lunga Lunga MP Khatib Mwashetani said the people of Kwale have benefited from Jubilee's development initiatives.&ldquo;If there is one constituency that has benefited from the development initiatives of Jubilee it is Lunga Lunga and that is why we have decided to rally behind you,&rdquo; said the MP.Mvurya and Mwashetani said more than 70 per cent of the people in Kwale will vote for Jubilee.
