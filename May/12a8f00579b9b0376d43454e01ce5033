he first cable car in Kenya will be established in Keiyo Escarpment if he is reelected, Elgeyo Marakwet Governor Alex Tolgos has said.Tolgos said he will build the system that will enable tourists to cross the Kerio Valley from Elgeyo Marakwet to neighbouring Baringo county.Speaking in Iten on Friday, he said the project will be undertaken by the Kenya Tourism Board and the county government.&ldquo;This is one of the projects that I wanted to complete in my first term in office but it failed to kick off,&rdquo; Tolgos said.He asked the national government to increase the allocation to marginalised counties like Elgeyo Marakwet.KTB conducted a feasibility study on the cable car project in 2015 but the project is yet to start. He asked why West Pokot receives the Equalisation Fund, yet Elgeyo Marakwet which is equally marginalised is denied the funds.&ldquo;Many areas, especially in the Kerio Valley of my county, were marginalised for a very ling time. &ldquo;We urge the Commission on Revenue Allocation to re-look at the national government allocation of funds formula. That method is quite unfair,&rdquo; Tolgos said.
