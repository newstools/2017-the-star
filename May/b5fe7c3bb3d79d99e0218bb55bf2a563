Agriculture CS Willy Bett (pictured) on Friday urged Kenyans to diversify farming to curb food shortage.Bett said the country faces maize shortage because many Kenyans depend on it as their staple food.The CS spoke at the Kenyenya Green Stadium in Bomachoge Borabu constituency where he launched avocado farming in Kisii county.Bett was invited by Kenya Health Inspectorate Service and distributed 10, 000 avocado seedling to trained farmers.He urged farmers to embrace avocado farming to improve their earnings.The CS was with KEPHIS managing director Esther Kimani, county commissioner Karanja Njora, county police commander Agnes Mudambi and Agriculture executive Vincent Sagwe.&ldquo;I urge the Kisii people to embrace intensive farming to increase food production for local consumption and export,&rdquo; Bett said.He added that Kisii is endowed with plenty of rainfall which residents need in planting various crops despite shrinking land sizes.Kimani said the demand for avocado has increased in the recent past because they are used as a healthy alternative and ingredient in beauty products.&ldquo;There is a need for farmers to embrace avocado farming for local and global markets. If all farmers grow avocado it would attract investors to put up factories to process the crop and create jobs,&rdquo; she said.The CS visited supermarkets in Kisii town to assess the uptake of the government&rsquo;s subsidised 2kg maize flour.
