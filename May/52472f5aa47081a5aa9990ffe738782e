Matthew Kimeli is relishing the challenge of facing double Olympic champion Mo Farah in 10,000m at the IAAF World Challenge in Ostrava this month. Kimeli expressed confidence that he can go toe-to-toe with the reigning world champion in both the 5,000 and 10,000m. &ldquo;My next assignment is the IAAF World Challenge in Ostrava on May 27, where I will take part in the 10,000m event. I understand Mo Farah will be running and it will be a good opportunity for me to gauge my performance. I believe I will do well,&rdquo; Kimeli added.Kimeli was in fine form over the weekend, breaking Puy en Velay 15km course record in France, and has now set his sights on claiming the scalp of the celebrated British athlete over the 25 laps event.Kimeli, who trains at St.Patrick&rsquo;s in Iten, said he harbours the ambition to represent Kenya at the IAAF World Championships in London later in the year. &ldquo;I was very impressed with the results and setting a course record for me was a just a motivation since I am still starting my career,&rdquo; Kimeli added. The men&rsquo;s 10,000m race will be held in Ostrava for the first time since 2004 when Ethiopia&rsquo;s Kenenisa Bekele set a world record of 26:20.31 and again lowered the mark by three seconds the following year.Kimeli clocked a personal best time of 28:19 last year during the national championships before heading to Prague Grand Prix 10km, where he timed 27:53 in fifth.According to him, good preparations enabled him to garner victory after training for five months without competing in any race abroad.&ldquo;From last year September, I decided to do my training focusing on speed and endurance. My mind was fixed on the France race and I am glad that I made it,&rdquo; he said.Initially, Kimeli was entering a race as a pace-setter and was under instruction to cross the 10km mark in 28:30 in which he did it insub-28.&ldquo;I was to pace and finish the race and when I saw that no one could catch me, I engaged my full gear and surged forward after crossing the mark with the required time,&rdquo;He said.
