We call for support to ensure we facilitate a transparent process," he said.The commission had promised to ensure only aspirants who pass the integrity test participate in the election.Wabukala's sentiments were echoed by Transparency International Executive Director Samuel Kimeu who said they will partner with the commission to ensure leaders are held accountable on matters of integrity."Though our laws are somehow contradictory, we shall ensure that we abide by chapter six of the constitution on leadership based on ethics and integrity," he said.Kimeu noted that any aspirant with a court casea dn uncleared questions and those on whom significant findings have been made by various institutions are not supposed to be on the ballot.He said clearance by a court does not matter."The criminal standard we stand on is purely for purposes of punishment and declaration of innocence of people, which does not really have the direct bearing of who qualifies to be a leader," he said.
