The High Court has declined to bar Narok governor aspirant Patrick Ntutu from contesting in the general election.Justice John Mativo said an application filed by Patu Naikumi seeking to bar the IEBC from accepting Ntutu&rsquo;s nomination papers was premature.&ldquo;The order sought by Naikumi cannot be issued at this stage and without hearing all parties,&rdquo; he said. Instead, Mativo directed the petitioner to serve the Kenya National Examinations Council and Ntutu with the suit papers and go back to court on June 7 for further direction.Naikumi petitioned the High Court seeking to disqualify the Narok West MP from vying, claiming he does not have a degree certificate.In his application, he claims the politician does not have a university degree and does not meet the basic criteria of prospective candidates wishing to vie for governor.&ldquo;It will be unjust if the aspirant is allowed to participate in campaigning and elections when his academic qualifications have been questioned,&rdquo; Naikumi says in an affidavit filed at the Milimani law courts.The voter says Ntutu has secured a Chama Cha Mashinani nomination ticket and the political rights of voters would be prejudiced if he is allowed to participate in the elections.Naikumi says he has tried unsuccessfully to get information from KNEC and the Commission for University Education to confirm Ntutu&rsquo;s academic credentials. He says the exams council has, without justification, refused to give him the information.
