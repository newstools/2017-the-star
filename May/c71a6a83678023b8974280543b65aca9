Migori governor aspirant Ochillo Ayacko is confident of winning in the August 8 election to make incumbent Okoth Obado a one-term governor, he has said.Obado was declared winner in the April 24 ODM primaries, but a disappointed Ayacko declared himself winner in a mock process.He also complained the nominations were marred by irregularities.Ayacko will run as an independent.&ldquo;I am also confident that the opposition in Migori will get maximum presidential votes for Raila Odinga,&rdquo; he said yesterday at Ramogi Baraza, a show on Radio Ramogi FM.He will have a two-day homecoming party and rallies on Friday and Saturday.The former Cabinet minister said Migori residents are aware the nomination process was marred with irregularities.On Friday, Ayacko will tour Rongo, Awendo, Uriri, Suna East and Suna West constituencies and on Saturday he will tour Nyatike, Kuria East and Kuria West constituencies.&ldquo;In the August polls, the county will have a referee who will give residents a chance to choose their preferred leader without interference,&rdquo; he said.Ayacko said during his campaigns he will spearhead the election of Raila by helping distribute banners and posters with his portrait to reverse voter apathy following the fallout after primaries.&ldquo;I am a voter ... and there is no rule barring me from supporting Raila who is my presidential candidate,&rdquo; he said.Ayacko said he still supports ODM ideologies, even though he is an independent candidate. He added, &ldquo;I will ensure equitable distribution of wealth, employment and include all tribes, clans and people in the county as currently only those close to power benefit the most.&rdquo;
