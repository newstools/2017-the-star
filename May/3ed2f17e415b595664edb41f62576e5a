Demonstrations erupted in parts of Molo, Nakuru county following a false alarm that Jubilee Party issued nomination certificate to MP Jacob Macharia.The protesting lot thought that the ticked had been handed over to the incumbent instead of Kuria Kimani who topped in the party's primaries last week."Police have launched manhunt on the suspected alarmists," Nakuru county commissioner Joshua Nkanatha said following the Friday incident.The demonstrators caused a heavy traffic snarl-up stretching over 10 kilometres on the Nakuru-Eldoret highway.The angry locals lit bonfires using car tyres at Sachangwan, Molo and Elburgon towns.Nkanatha urged the locals to shun propaganda saying he was sure the nomination certificates had not been issued.The angry residents chanted songs of "No Kuria! No Jubilee!", paralysing transport since 6pm as they vowed not to open the road 'until justice is done'.
