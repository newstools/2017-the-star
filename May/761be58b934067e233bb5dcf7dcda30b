Cartels in government and farmers in Mexico benefited from the importation of maize to address the current food shortage, Amani leader Musalia Mudavadi has said.The NASA co-principal said they wondered where the government got the Sh6 billion to import the maize yet there was no money to pay farmers for their produce."Who benefited from the imports? Governments across the world give their farmers subsidies to farmers and not importers or farmers in Mexico. This is scandalous."He spoke at the NASA rally at Gusii Stadium on Wednesday.NASA flag bearer Raila Odinga, his running mate Kalonzo Musyoka, Bungoma senator Moses Wetangula and Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto were present.Raila questioned the government over its expenditure of billions of shillings on the controversial Gulana Kalulu irrigation scheme."Instead of getting about 30-40 bags like in Kitale, we are now getting 10 bags per acre at Gulana Kalulu yet the government has pumped in billions of shillings."The former PM hit out at Jubilee for reducing the amount of money paid to maize farmers by Sh1, 000."When we were in government, farmers used to get Sh3, 200 per bag. Now they are getting less than that while Mexican farmers were paid Sh4,200," he said.He claimed the move by the government to reduce the price of maize flour is a gimmick adding that the cost will be covered by in increased petrol prices.Siaya senator James Orengo and Kitutu Masaba MP Timothy Bosire said they doubt if indeed the maize originated from Mexico.They demanded that the government explains what happened to the maize in the Strategic Grain Reserves."A government that cannot feed her people does not have a moral obligation to lead. They should be voted out in August," Bosire said.Homa Bay senator Moses Kajwang, however, said the subsidy will only benefit few people who use sifted flour."90 per cent of people use flour which is milled locally. The importation of maize is a gimmick by Jubilee to hoodwink the people," Kajwang said.Read: GOK's Sh90 unga hits supermarkets but buyers limited to two packsAlso read: Expect GOK subsidised flour in all retail stores by Friday, says millers
