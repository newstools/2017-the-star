Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho has said the Tuesday morning ferry scare has justified his call for a bridge in the Likoni Channel.The MV Nyayo, the biggest and oldest ferry, developed mechanical problems at around 7am. It was pushed by big tides off the Likoni Channel towards the deep sea.There were more than 1,000 commuters on board.Speaking at Mbaraki Girls Primary School, Joho accused the national government of blocking the county&rsquo;s attempt to put up a bridge in the channel.&ldquo;This is the conversation I&rsquo;ve always wanted to have. In the entire world today, no one thinks of rebuilding ferries.&ldquo;We had so many interested investors had wanted to get a concession and build a bridge,&rdquo; Joho said.&ldquo;If we had focused on building a bridge across the channel to the South Coast, today we would not have this conversation.&rdquo;The governor criticised President Uhuru Kenyatta, who on March 13 launched the resumption of ferry services across the Mtongwe Channel. On April 26, a pontoon at the channel was swept away by Indian Ocean waves, disrupting ferry services.The services are yet to resume because the pontoon is yet to be repaired.
