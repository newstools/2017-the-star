A computer malware that has spread across 150 countries appears to be slowing down, with few reports of fresh attacks globally on Monday.A spokesperson for police agency Europol said the situation in Europe "seems stable".In Asia, where many offices closed before the WannaCry ransomware struck on Friday, the attack has been less severe than expected.The ransomware takes over users' files, demanding $300 (&pound;230) to restore them.The White House said on Monday that under $70,000 (&pound;54,000) had been paid in total in a bid to get any locked data released.Payments could go up as the ransomware warned the cost would double after three days, and threatened to delete files within seven days if no payment was made.Computer giant Microsoft said the attack, which has affected hundreds of thousands of computers, should serve as a wake-up call.Among the organisations targeted worldwide have been Germany's rail network Deutsche Bahn, Spanish telecommunications operator Telefonica, US logistics giant FedEx and Russia's interior ministry.Many firms employed experts over the weekend to try to prevent new infections.Senior spokesman for Europol, Jan Op Gen Oorth, told the AFP news agency: "The number of victims appears not to have gone up and so far the situation seems stable in Europe, which is a success."UK Health Minister Jeremy Hunt confirmed to the BBC that UK intelligence services had found no evidence of a second wave of attacks on Monday.The badly affected National Health Service said seven out of 47 trusts that were hit were still facing serious issues.French carmaker Renault said its plant in the northern town of Douai would not reopen on Monday as it dealt with the cyber-attack.
