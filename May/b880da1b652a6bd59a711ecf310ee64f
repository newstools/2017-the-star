Busia County Referral Hospital is appealing to residents to donate blood. It says many patients are in need of blood.Kenya National Blood Transfusion Service Busia Satellite manager David Bulimu on Tuesday said the centre had only 12 pints, which are still being processed.Addressing the press at the Transfusion Centre, Bulimu said Kakamega, Kisumu, Bungoma and Eldoret, which used to bail them out during emergencies, have also run out of blood.&ldquo;This leaves us in a precarious position with our hopes now on good Samaritans to visit our facility from today [Wednesday] onwards to donate blood and help save lives of patients whose lives hang in the balance.We have been forced to transfer 17 patients to other hospitals outside the county who needed blood transfusion. We still receive many other patients especially those with anaemia, sickle cell, accident and mothers who develop complications during delivery,&rdquo; he said.Accompanied by hospital administrator Eric Wamalwa, Bulimu said people aged between 16 and 60 years can donate blood. Busia journalists have offered to donate blood on Friday.&ldquo;We lost two children and one adult last month due to blood related ailments. We cannot afford to lose more lives,&rdquo; Bulimu said. He said willing donors should visit the blood satellite centre customer care desk for more information.
