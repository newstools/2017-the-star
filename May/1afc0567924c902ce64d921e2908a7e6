Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong stormed out of an ODM meeting in Kakamega yesterday after he did not receive his nomination certificate.ODM deputy leader Wycliffe Oparanya called off the meeting to allow people &ldquo;to cool down&rdquo; after they started yelling at each other.&ldquo;I have assured Ojaamong his certificate was prepared but there was a problem with the date and there is no cause for alarm because he will receive it soon,&rdquo; he said.ODM Teso North aspirant Lawi Mamae also missed his certificate, adding to the confusion.But Oparanya said it was a mix-up and would be rectified soon as he has a provisional certificate.More confusion arose when it was discovered that all four MCA aspirants from Funyula constituency were unavailable to collect their certificates, as they have decided to run as independents.This could signal the deepening rift between the party and Funyula MP Paul Otuoma, who resigned from ODM to run for Busia governor as an independent candidate.Sources told the Star MCA all aspirants aligned to Otuoma in the disputed primaries were denied certificates, despite their opponents not petitioning their victories.Otuoma bolted from ODM following shambolic nominations in which Ojaamong was declared the winner.Oparanya said the party will replace the candidates who did not collect their certificates.
