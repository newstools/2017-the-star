Socialite Huddah Monroe has come out to attack politicians who forget what they promised when they were begging for votes. Huddah said the government and the opposition should stop attacking each other like socialites and lead a peaceful Kenya.In her social media pages, Huddah posted:"Our government and the opposition busy attacking each other like a group of socialites! They have no morals...All these old men will die sooner or later and we will all be left here to mend the country they destroyed.Coz immediately they win, they get amnesia, they forget all they promised when they were begging for the votes."Huddah further said she has turned down many political job offers because she hates politics and the people in it."I've been offered so much to support political groups... But i hate politics and the people in it.I've seen politics ruin images of so many people who are trying to build their brands and careers."She continued:"They all want the seat, not to bring change but to steal.They all want to lead us, but none of them is talking sense and the stupid poor people who have the real power forget their power always."
