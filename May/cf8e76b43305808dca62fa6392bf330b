The emergence of independent candidates as the &ldquo;third force&rdquo; in our national politics cannot be underestimated because its consequences are likely going to send reverberations across the political divide.The fact remains that it is Jubilee and NASA that are going to feel the effect of this force after the August 8 election.Its emergence is a direct result of the total failure by political parties in conducting free and fair primaries, which were chaotic, marred by bribery, tribalism, nepotism, and outright favouritism.Indeed, there is virtually no political party or coalition that can lay claim to have conducted its party primaries in a free, fair, democratic and corruption-free manner as is done in most advanced democracies across the world.Thousands of aspirants contested the nominations outcome, and this was not only in the main political parties such as ODM, Jubilee, Wiper, but also in ANC, Ford Kenya, DP and many others.The parties&rsquo; national elections tribunal handled many of these cases in their thousands, as did the ineffective political parties&rsquo; internal dispute resolution mechanisms. But this does not excuse the massive failures that for the first time in this country&rsquo;s history have led to 4,950 candidates running as independents.This provision was entrenched in the 2010 Constitution. It therefore follows that after being denied their democratic and constitutional rights during the messed up primaries, the Constitution and this electoral laws offered them an alternative they could use to have their names on the ballot.This will enable them to seek elective positions despite being restricted by parties through members or crude manipulations and brokers, who were out to make a killing from the exercise.Therefore, the leadership of various political outfits, be they ODM, Wiper or Jubilee, have no moral right to criticise the emergence of this third force of independent candidates, who may yet be another extremely powerful force to reckon with in the National Assembly, the Senate and the 47 county assemblies across the country.It is perhaps from this realisation that some political party leaders are already feeling very jittery about this force, which in essence will be financing their own campaigns without getting financial support from parties. Campaigns have become very expensive, especially in Africa.However, their fears and contradictions are of no consequence since they have no legal or moral standing to stop the avalanche that has erupted with this development and is most likely to rock the country&rsquo;s politicking for decades to come.What remains to be seen is the impact they are going to have in crafting and passing legislation in the Senate, the National Assembly and in the county assemblies, where political parties have long had monopolistic strangleholds.
