A KDF soldier was injured during an ambush by Pokot bandits in Kamwenje, Laikipia county on Saturday.The bandits shot at their vehicle as KDF was patrolling the area, which has experienced repeated attacks including shooting, cattle rustling and robbery incidents.Soldiers pursued the gunmen on foot and managed to arrest one and confiscate his weapon.Residents have linked local politicians to violent incidents in the area as they use desperate measures to shore up fading political power bases ahead of the August 8 polls.Among those who have denied links to raids by bandits are Tiaty MP Asman Kamama and Laikipia North MP Mathew Lempurkel.Lempurkel had been implicated in the murder of British farmer Tristan Voorspuy, but was cleared due to lack of evidence.Local sources say Pokot bandits in Malaso/Amaiya area in Baringo County are planning to invade Laikipia en masse with their cattle and other livestock in the coming days to bring lawlessness as campaigns for the general election begin.Read: MP Lempurkel denies involvement in Suyian ranch invasionKDF soldiers were deployed in Laikipia in March following increasing invasions on luxury lodges in the drought-stricken area."The KDF are ultra efficient by comparison, well commanded, disciplined and brave," a resident said.But the source added that the soldiers were placed under the county commander whom he termed incompetent."Sadly they have been placed under the commander who has stymied their work in order to hide his incompetence and that of police officers incapable of doing their jobs due to fear and poor training and back up," the witness said.
