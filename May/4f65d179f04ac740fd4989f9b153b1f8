IT seems Kitui West MP Francis Nyenze faced a rebellion back home after his remarks that Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka must be the NASA presidential flagbearer. Kalonzo confirmed he read of some of the protests by locals in Kitui West on social media. Kalonzo had to invite a humble-looking Nyenze to a presser at his Karen private office yesterday, where he pleaded with his followers to support his reelection bid. A top official in Wiper hinted that locals might not have been happy with the Minority Leader since &ldquo;all Kambas&rdquo; want a change in the country's leadership. For saying Kalonzo was shortchanged in the NASA lineup, some people in Ukambani believed Nyenze was a Jubilee agent.************* AN influential politician and party leader seems to be playing dirty with the imminent nominations to the East African Legislative Assembly. Reason? The man is determined to nominate his own son to the regional Parliament. Even as he seeks a top job in Kenya, the man wants Kenyans to sponsor his own son to the EALA? How he hopes to push through the name in Parliament is still unclear. Some politicians were heard to complain that if you don't have a big name in Kenya, you cannot be anything. Sad! Corridors promises to smoke him out.****************** A wealthy ODM aspirant from Nyanza caused a stir in Gracia Gardens when he attempted to force his way into the compound, despite a police barrier. The flamboyant politician, who was driven by a slender young lady in dark glasses, kept on talking on the phone to avoid taking instructions from the police. A hawk-eyed officer swung into action after realising that the politician was pretending to be talking on phone and blocked the car from accessing the compound. The youthful politician moved in to the driver's seat and drove off in a huff. The politician, who is contesting the results of the ODM primaries in his constituency, risks being sent into political oblivion see his dream to join politics dashed, should he lose an appeal he lodged at the party tribunal.****************** SHOULD the Senate Public Accounts and Investments Committee wind up its sittings and allow members and governors to campaign for the August 8 polls? While the Senate standing orders allow a quorum of four members, the committee&rsquo;s serious work may be neutralised by just two members questioning a governor on multi-billion-shilling projects on behalf of the country. One member who arrived late during a sitting this week was caught off-guard when a senator kept posing irrelevant technical questions to a governor. The county chief was irritated and nearly told off the senator during the three-hour grilling on audit queries. &ldquo;This is just a waste of time,&rdquo; the governor was overheard telling his staff as they walked out.******************** THE Orange party national elections board and Orange House operatives must seek proper security ahead of the Party's National Delegates' Convention. Reason? Some aspirants and their supporters are so upset by the recent primaries that they may just attack some officials. The aspirants believe NEB officials were bribed to lock them out. In some instances, the same board has defied the party's appeals tribunal, defeating logic how the two organs of the party operate.
