Shambolic primaries, violence, dismissal of results by aspirants and IEBC&rsquo;S unpreparedness could plunge the country into anarchy, a lobby warns, barely 95 days to the general election.Addressing journalists yesterday in Nairobi, the Dialogue Reference Group said it took time reviewing the party primaries.Composed of various churches and civil society groups, the group &ldquo;found a stark reminder that the evil that we allow to affect a few people could eventually spread to the whole nation&rdquo;.&ldquo;There were observed pockets of violence that resulted in loss of life and property and destruction of property,&rdquo; Anglican Church of Kenya Archbishop Jackson ole Sapit (pictured) said.He said what stood out most during the primaries is that violent incidences were related to grievances, where individuals or groups felt injustices were perpetrated.&ldquo;This is a stark reminder to all Kenyans and especially security agencies that whereas large-scale violence may not be pre-meditated, appearance of injustice during elections could spark violent protests,&rdquo; Sapit warned.National Muslim Leaders Forum&rsquo;s Al-Hajj Yussuf said the huge number of appeals at party tribunals is a reflection of undemocratic practices and aspirants&rsquo; refusal to accept the results.&ldquo;We must, as a nation, decide that we will be a people who appreciate fair play and accept results even if we lose,&rdquo; he said, urging Kenyans to accept the August 8 poll results.Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops&rsquo; Alfred Rotich urged Kenyans to uphold peace as &ldquo;it will be unwise to destroy the country&rdquo;. He urged police to deal with militia groups.
