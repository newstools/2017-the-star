Gradual return to normal," Paris police said in a tweet.Authorities gave no other details about the nature of the operation.Security has been stepped up across France because of Sunday's presidential runoff, which Emmanuel Macron won.Over the past two years, the country has been hit by a series of Islamist militant attacks in Paris and other cities in which more than 230 people have been killed.R
