If it&rsquo;s not insatiable pests, it&rsquo;s crippling diseases. If it&rsquo;s not rain delays, it&rsquo;s poor prices. Maize just can&rsquo;t seem to catch a break. After losing so much grain the past three or four seasons, farmers in the North Rift are diversifying their crop. And if the trend continues, families around the country will find it hard to maintain ugali as their staple diet.The latest threat to maize production is the armyworm invasion. This destroyed maize crops across the North Rift and Western Kenya, some of the the country&rsquo;s grain baskets.The unforgiving worms have wreaked havoc in Baringo, Bungoma, Busia, Kakamega, Kericho, Kitale, Nakuru, Nandi, Trans Nzoia and Uasin Gishu counties in March and April, destroying thousands of acres of maize crop.William Kimosong, Trans Nzoia branch chairman of the Kenya National Farmers Federation, says farmers did not anticipate the invasion and could incur huge losses.MAIZE A &lsquo;WASTE OF TIME&rsquo;In Elgeyo Marakwet, several farmers are now venturing into potato and vegetable farming as they reduce maize acreages on their farms.This comes amid a maize shortage crisis that has caused maize flour prices to skyrocket, compelling the state to allow importation of cheap maize from as far as Mexico to remedy the problem.Others have dumped maize farming for poultry farming, citing high costs of productions, low yields and poor prices.Shunning of the maize crop by some farmers comes amid an acute maize grains shortage that has driven maize flour prices high, leading to importation of maize from as far as Mexico and South Africa.On the outskirts of Iten town, Fanice Sang, a 30-year-old farmer, describes maize farming as a waste of time and resources due to poor prices.Sang says she ventured into poultry farming a year and three months ago after at least five years of unsuccessful attempts in maize farming.Discouraged by poor prices and the cost of fertiliser, seeds and labour, Sang quit crop farming for chicken keeping, and she has no regrets.&ldquo;In February 2016, as my neighbours prepared their farms to plant maize, a friend introduced me to chicken keeping. I decided to shun maize to take the risk,&rdquo; she says.The mother of three says she started with 30 one-day-old chicks and today, she rears 500 chicks every month as demand for chicken increases.&ldquo;I get orders to deliver chicken to as far as Limuru. At times I&rsquo;m forced to ask for some chicken from neighbouring farms to meet the high demand,&rdquo; Sang says.She says she gets her improved kienyeji chicken from Kuku Chic, a company that researches and supplies different kinds of chicken breeds.In Kapyego, Marakwet East, maize growing has been shunned almost completely as farmers adopt potato growing.Elkana Ruto, a 25-year-old farmer in Kapyego, says local farmers are reaping big from potato farming.Ruto says a 50kg bag currently retails at Sh3,000, up from Sh1,000 in 2015 and 2016.He thanks the Agriculture ministry for introducing the 50kg packaging, saying some potato buyers had capitalised on the 90kg packaging to exploit farmers.Ruto says farmers are enjoying the high prices, despite not selling their produce directly to consumers.&ldquo;We still sell our potatoes through brokers. They are the available farmers. I cannot say brokers are bad people because they are our sole buyers,&rdquo; he says.Some farmers in the highlands of Elgeyo Marakwet who have been relying on maize for years are now migrating to drier areas of the Kerio Valley, where a variety of crops are grown under irrigation.IRRIGATION INCENTIVEOne of them, Nick Kipruto, says the farmers were worried following the delay of the rains after the maize seeds they planted in March failed to germinate.With temperature rising to an average of 31 degrees and with scarcity of rains in the Kerio Valley, irrigation is making most farmers who had moved to the highlands come back to venture into a variety of crops.In several areas of the Kerio Valley belt, farmers are busy in the farms, with planting, weeding and harvesting going on throughout the year thanks to irrigation.At a Sh300 million Kabanon-Kapkamak irrigation scheme in Arror, farmers are into green gram farming. The scheme enables some 900 families to grow various short season crops, including tomatoes and beans. Isaac Macharia, an agricultural officer who manages the scheme, says it has lured back farmers who had moved to the highlands to try maize farming.Resident Andrew Chebii, 42, says he had migrated to Kapcherop near Trans Nzoia county, where maize is the crop grown by almost every farmer.Chebii says he heard of the irrigation scheme and came back immediately, noting that the Kerio Valley is more productive.He grows green grams, watermelons, groundnuts, and sorghums, but says: &ldquo;I could not make ends meet while I was living and farming in the highlands.&ldquo;In the Kerio Valley we sell short season crops directly to our clients. This means we get cash all year round, unlike maize, which we harvest once every year,&rdquo; he says.Chebii says he carries out proper timing to ensure he harvests short season crops at least once every month throughout the year.&ldquo;This has enabled me to take care of my three children comfortably, something I was struggling with while living in the highlands,&rdquo; he said.POOR ROADS HURT TRADEThomas Chemwaka, a farmer manager in Arror, says the biggest problem the farmers face is poor road networks.Chemwaka calls on both levels of government to improve road networks to enhance links between local farmers and their markets in the neighbouring Baringo and Uasin Gishu counties.He says watermelon traders come from Nairobi for the region&rsquo;s high quality fruits.Farmers say the Biretwo Arror road under the Kenya National Highways Authority, which connects the Kerio Valley to the Iten&ndash;Kabarnet highway, is in a deplorable state, discouraging traders from visiting the place.&ldquo;The roads are only passable during the dry season. Several areas are completely cut off during the rainy seasons,&rdquo; Chemwaka said.Farmers in Marakwet highlands are slowly dropping the maize crop, despite the area having the best climatic conditions for the crop.In coffee zones and hanging valleys, farmers have been urged to venture into macadamia nut farming to boost their income.Macadamia nuts, apart from earning the farmers income, serve as an environmental conservation crop, especially at the hanging valleys, where the land is prone to soil erosion.Elgeyo Marakwet county crops officer Peter Isigi advises local farmers to adopt diversification as one way of commercialising agriculture.Isigi says venturing into macadamia will be more profitable to farmers due to its low cost of production and its resistance to pests and diseases.He says the trees, which can be intercropped with coffee trees. The new venture, Isigi says, has been subsidised by the Elgeyo government to encourage more farmers to diversify their crop.The crops officer said the crop, which is gaining popularity in Central Kenya, is propagated by grafting and requires fertile, well-drained soils and adequate amount of rainfall of about 1,000-2,000mm.Isigi says following the subsidy, a farmer is able to buy a grafted macadamia seedling at Sh200 instead of Sh350.&ldquo;A farmer will only wait five years for the trees to mature and get harvest nuts for at least 100 years,&rdquo; he says.The crops officer said one macadamia tree produces approximately 900kg per year and a kilo of macadamia nuts is selling at Sh200.&ldquo;Farmers should not worry about the market. The county government has promised to find ready market for the nuts because it does not want farmers to over-rely on maize.&rdquo;SUBSTANDARD FERTILISERPeter Chelimo, one of the farmers in Kapsowar, said he planted two macadamia trees on his farm two years ago, and he is amazed at how well it has grown.Last year, maize production in four counties, Elgeyo Marakwet, Nandi, Trans Nzoia and Uasin Gishu, was hurt by a ravaging fungal disease identified as maize head smut, barely two years after another strange disease known as Maize Lethal Necrosis struck the region, putting the country&rsquo;s food security on the line.The diseases left farmers counting losses and discouraged in a region known for high production of maize and wheat, earning itself the name the &lsquo;grain basket&rsquo; of Kenya.Mindililwo and Kamoi areas (Elgeyo MaraKwet), Ol&rsquo; Lessos (Nandi county), Moiben (Uasin Gishu) and Endebes (Trans Nzoia) were the worst-hit areas, according to a report released by Agriculture PS Richard Lesiyampe.In Elgeyo Marakwet, farmers blamed the disease on sub-standard fertiliser and seeds.Emmanuel Kirui, a farmer in Mindililwo, Keiyo North subcounty, said the disease had affected his entire three-acre maize farm.Kirui says trouble started earlier this year when, weeks after planting, the crops yellowed and stagnated.He says the crop improved when he used a top dressing fertiliser at the end of May.&ldquo;It seems the fertiliser we got from the national cereals board had a problem. We are asking the government to analyse it to confirm our doubts. We would also wish to be told if the seeds from Kenya Seed Company were the right seeds for this area,&rdquo; Kirui said.But after the losses, Kirui has converted half of the farm into a dairy farm.Agriculture ministry reports indicate that the grain harvest in the North Rift has been on the decline.At least 4 million bags of maize were harvested in 2013, while 3.2 million bags were harvested in 2014.Production has been less than three million since then, in what the county&rsquo;s Agriculture executive Cyril Cheruiyot attributed to low germination due to delayed rains.
