A fire destroyed a dormitory and students&rsquo; belongings at St Peter Nyarongo Secondary School, Suna East, on Sunday, when the students were at a church service in a neighbouring school.The property was estimated to be worth Sh2.8 million.Ninety-four students were housed in the dormitory.Speaking to the Star, principal Charles Ombago said, &ldquo;Investigations to ascertain the cause of the inferno are ongoing, but there was no any causality.&rdquo;He said the affected students have been sent home as the school looks for new accommodation.&ldquo;By sending them home, that is a big setback for education performance,&rdquo; Ombago said.He urged the CDF committee and the county government to help rebuild the dormitory.
