Embu deputy speaker Ibrahim Swaleh, who is also the Kirimari ward representative, has blamed his loss in the Jubilee MCA primaries on his supporters&rsquo; failure to turn up in large numbers to vote for him. He said they were overconfident he would win because he had fulfilled his election pledges. Swaleh also alleged voter bribery. He lost to Morris Muchiri who got 2,229 votes, against his 1,732. Swaleh will defend his seat as an independent candidate. &ldquo;My rivals massively bribed voters and manipulated results.&rdquo;
