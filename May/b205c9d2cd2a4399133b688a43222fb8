Small and medium-sized millers have complained about being locked out of the government's flour subsidy plan.Their chairman Peter Kuguru on Thursday said they were not consulted over the Sh90 for 2kg flour programme.He said Agriculture CS Willy Bett only consulted them on the availability of maize in the market. "We were sidelined when it came to the subsidy initiative. We are a group that provides 60 per cent of the maize in the market.""The CS has always consulted us but we are surprised we were not considered in this plan," Kuguru said.He said they were informed that the government had subsidised the recently imported maize at Sh1,300 per 90kg bag.Read: GOK's Sh90 unga hits supermarkets but buyers limited to two packsAlso read: Expect GOK subsidised flour in all retail stores by Friday, says millersBut Agriculture PS Richard Lesiyampe said the medium-sized millers have been allocated 200,000 bags.He said the strategic grain reserves will remain empty until September."We are expecting about 50,000 metric tonnes of maize that will arrive via Moyale on Saturday.""These will be transferred to Marsabit, Nanyuki, Nyeri and may also reach Thika," the PS said at Kilimo House.He said grain depots will be moved closer to the small millers to cut transport cost.The PS said that though they have missed on phase one of maize allocation, he will give directions after 10 days.Lesiyampe said most small millers had not complied with the KRA regulations hence the delays.He warned that those found selling the branded flour above the stipulated prices will be jailed for 6 years or fined Sh1 million.Read: NASA leaders poke holes on GOK flour subsidy, says only cartels will reap big
