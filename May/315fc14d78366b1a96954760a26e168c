Nyanza region representatives in the forthcoming Kenya Secondary Schools Sports Association (KSSSA) Term ‘2A’ games have set a target of winning two nationals titles. The games are set to start at Shimo La Tewa on June 3. The teams are seeking to book places at the East Africa Secondary Schools Sports Associations (KSSSA) Championships set for Gulu, Uganda in August. Sinyolo Girls and Kisumu Day have already booked slots in the regional show. “We already have two teams which have already qualified as we head to Mombasa. We want more teams to qualify,” said Tom Odhiambo, the KSSSA Nyanza region secretary. The Nyanza teams for the nationals include Maseno School and St. Joseph’s Rapogi (rugby 7’s), Obambo (netball), Sega Girls (handball girls), Kanyawanga (handball boys), Kisumu Day (under 16 boys football) and Nyakach (under-16 girls football). Maseno coach Paul Nyamita said they will be eyeing the title at the national games. Maseno inspired by Brian Ayimba, the eldest son of former 7’s coach Benjamin Ayimba, beat St. Joseph’s Rapogi 22-14 to defend the title. The school’s new principal Andrew Buop said he will support the team as they head to nationals. Rapogi will be making their debut at the nationals. “When we lost to Maseno in the final last week, we started preparations for the nationals. We know all the teams are preparing for the same but we are not going to be pushovers,” said Rapogi coach Enock Mokua. Rapogi will rely on Strathmore Leos-bound Leon Nyang’ who was the top try scorer at the regionals. Nine-time Nyanza region champions Obambo hope to reclaim their national title, which they lost to Kaya Tiwi. Obambo coach Alice Marire said: “Kaya Tiwi is a very strong team but we are going to Mombasa to try and reclaim our title. The regionals helped expose weaknesses in my team and I’m currently working on them.”
