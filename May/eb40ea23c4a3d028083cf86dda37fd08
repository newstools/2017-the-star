Senator Johnson Muthama has declared he is no longer married to Jubilee Machakos woman representative nominee Agnes Kavindu.Muthama told journalists on Friday that he only accommodated Kavindu at his home when he realised she was suffering after their divorced in 1983."I had children with her and being human, I gave her a place to stay when I saw how much she was suffering," he said."She is lying that we are married now that she has made money. I hope she does not want to ride on my name."The legislator said he has all legal documents showing he divorced Kavindu and got back what he paid as dowry."She cannot even be buried in my home since her parents refunded the dowry," Muthama said.Kavindu was one of 35 aspirants in the county who received Jubilee tickets from Susan Maina, Jubilee's regional coordinator for Nairobi area.She thanked President Uhuru Kenyatta's party for paving the way for her to vie.She will face Joyce Kamene (Wiper), Francisca Mutinda (Maendeleo Chap Chap), Jane Ndeti (CCU) and independent candidate Rita Ndunge."The President has always supported women... I promise to deliver," she said on Monday.Read: Muthama's ex-wife Agnes Kavindu gets Jubilee ticket for Machakos woman rep
