Wiper Kitui Senate seat nominee Enoch Wambua has said those who quit after losing during nominations were never really loyal to the party.Wambua, a former Standard Group editor, said the defectors did not have Wiper&rsquo;s interests at heart. He spoke last Friday at his home in Kabati town, Kitui West subcounty. He received a heroe&rsquo;s welcome when he returned home after being awarded the Wiper certificate in Nairobi.Wambua said though some quitters felt they were indispensable, the reality is the party is better off without them.He said Wiper was stronger than ever.&ldquo;After every nomination, these kinds of fallouts are expected. I want to assure the membership of Wiper there is no vacuum in the party whatsoever. For me, those exits are inconsequential and, to some extent, I would say some of them are good riddance,&rdquo; Wambua said.Kitui Senator David Musila resigned as a member and national chairman of Wiper soon after he lost the nominations for governor to incumbent Julius Malombe. Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama also left the party after his preferred candidate Benard Kiala lost the party governor race to former Kathiani MP Wavinya Ndeti.Wambua said, &ldquo;It is ridiculous for a leader to quit the party because the candidate he was pushing for did not win.&rdquo;He said it was not justified for anyone to quit to protest a decision made by the electorate.Muthama cited massive irregularities and injustice in the party, saying only the chosen few were given tickets.&ldquo;I regret the way Wiper is being micromanaged to the disadvantage of some party members. My decision [to quit] was influenced by the way Wiper affairs are being conducted,&rdquo; he told a press conference last week.
