A motorist who caused the death of six family members in a Nakuru-Eldoret highway accident has been released on Sh2 million bond. A Molo court gave Patrick Nyaga the option of Sh300,000 cash bail following the accident at Sobea on April 21. Nyaga denied six counts of causing death by driving dangerously before chief magistrate Samuel Wahome on Wednesday. The victims were identified as Daniel Wanjau, Esther Wangui, Joan Deborah, Jane Wambui, Miriam Wanjiru and John Mwangi. The relatives were on their way to Ol Kalou in Nyandarua for a dowry payment ceremony. It is said the matatu they were travelling in rammed into a trailer it was overtaking. The case will be heard on July 17.
