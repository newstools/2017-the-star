There are some things and incidents I believe can only happen to me. For instance, I&rsquo;ll be at dinner with friends or family and we are all eating the same fillet of fish, and my portion will be the only one with a bone in it.Years ago, despite what I like to call my iron constitution, which basically means I can eat most things without any consequences by way of tummy trouble, my old friend Grace and I went and bought samosas from this shop in town. We ate them with friends, but I was the only one who had food poisoning, everybody else was just fine.Recently I was on assignment reporting on a pan-African conference that brought together the heads of Supreme Courts and constitutional courts from jurisdictions across the continent, including the Chief Justices of South Africa and Kenya. The conference room was full of judicial officers and their staffers, and outside the doors of the conference hall was a battalion of armed close protection officers (bodyguards to you and me).Despite being in what I would have though was a most secure situation, a person, or persons unknown, had the temerity to carry out a criminal offence - a misdemeanour, if I&rsquo;m honest - against me.I think I can say without fear of contradiction that I am the only person who has been robbed in a room packed full of the most senior judges Africa has to offer. The theft occurred in the short time it took for me to leave my place in the conference hall for a coffee break. When I came back to my place, my notepad and pen (both quite cheap and supplied by venue as part of the conference package) were missing.Thank goodness I had taken my mobile phone and my bag containing my notebook and other conference documentation with me on my coffee break, or else those, too, might have gone missing. Despite my being too shocked at the brazeness of the thief or thieves to report the crime (also, really it wasn&rsquo;t like I had used them, even though on the other hand, there was the principle of the matter), both notepad and pen were replaced by the afternoon session of the conference, and the rest of the conference proceeded without incident.Thinking about the robbery, though, I guess whoever was behind it figured it was the perfect crime, as nobody would suspect a petty thief in a room full of Africa&rsquo;s dispensers of justice as they discussed, among other things, the rule of law.It reminded me of a story about an old friend of mine who was infamous amongst us, his friends, for occasionally taking a stroll into the car park of Nairobi&rsquo;s Central Police station - on his way to or from the National Theatre bar - and while hidden in plain sight, lighting up and smoking a marijuana cigarette, knowing that it was the last place the police would ever think to look for someone smoking bhang.
