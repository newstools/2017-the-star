Mombasa Senate hopeful Jabess Oduor, a harsh critic of Governor Hassan Joho, is fighting the county after his billboard was pulled down for &ldquo;unpaid fees&rdquo;.The highly visible billboard was strategically placed in Kengeleni.Oduor said he put it up on May 8, through Think Outdoor advertising agency.The Kongowea MCA, who wants to run as an independent, produced receipts indicating he had paid the company Sh150,800 for the billboard.It was to stay up for one month but it was pulled down by county inspectorate officers two days later on May 10.The company now says it decided to terminate the contract with Oduor but gave no reason. It said it will refund his money &mdash; which never made it to county coffers.Acting Trade executive Tawfiq Balala told the Star on Friday the billboard came down because it had not been paid for.&ldquo;I knew he would politicise it. His is not the only billboard brought down. Others were pulled down because they had not been paid for after the April 30 deadline passed,&rdquo; Balala told the Star on the phone.Oduor linked the removal to politics, saying county honchos do not want him to become the senator.&ldquo;This is not the first time they have done this to me. Remember in 2014? They did the same after I supported the impeachment of a corrupt county executive,&rdquo; Oduor said on Wednesday.In February 2014, then Finance executive Walid Khalid claimed Vision Advertising Company, associated with Oduor, had not paid the county Sh8 million in revenue. All its billboards in the county were pulled down.On Friday, Balala said he has no problem with Oduor and he will order the billboard restored when he produces county receipts showing the advertising has been paid for.&ldquo;I am not worried. I am not a politician. It does not bother me. Just show me the county government receipts and the billboard will be put up,&rdquo; he said.
