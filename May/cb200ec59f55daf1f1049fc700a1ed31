The Sh250 million Kitale bus park will be commissioned in two weeks, Trans Nzoia Governor Patrick Khaemba has said.The contractor is in the final stages of completing the state-of-the-art station.On Friday, Khaemba toured the station and said it was designed to serve as a bus park and business centre.&ldquo;We shall also agree on how to allocate offices to the [matatu] saccos to avoid friction,&rdquo; the governor added.He said the bus park will decongest Kitale town. The traffic police department has been brought on board to also suggest ways through which congestion can be minimised as the park opens to the public, Khaemba said.During his inspection, the workers were tarmacking the final section.Khaemba said it has taken one-and-a-half years as the bus park was on a slope and it took time to level it.&ldquo;We also discovered that a big rubbish dump pit was beneath the ground running about nine metres deep,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;We had to clear the dumpsite and put in more concrete to make the ground more firm. That is why we had delays.&rdquo;
