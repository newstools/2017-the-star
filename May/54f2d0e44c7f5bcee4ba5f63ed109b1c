A key parliamentary watchdog committee yesterday clashed with Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi over &lsquo;doctored&rsquo; documents. The Senate Public Accounts Committee put the governor on the spot over submission of documents which contradicted earlier ones his officers reportedly gave the auditors.The county officials, in response to an audit query by Auditor General Edward Ouko&rsquo;s office regarding award of a Sh11.4 million tender, had submitted a prequalification list which did not include the bid winner.Barawa Limited was awarded the tender for the procurement of staff uniforms and ceremonial dresses for the inspectorate department. Auditors representing Ouko said Barawa was not in the list of 11 companies prequalified, as Kingi fought to clear his name.
