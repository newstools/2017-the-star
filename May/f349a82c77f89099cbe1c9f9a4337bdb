Alcoholism, jigger infestation and organised crime have been identified as the major threats facing youths in Central Kenya.The National Committee for Implementation of Citizen Participation in Security has said there is urgent need to fix the problems. The Committee said the church and local leaders have failed to address the issues, leaving the youths to carry out illegal activities on their watch. This emerged at the end of a five-day training for lay leaders from the region. The committee decried the high levels of alcoholism.Addressing the press, Salim Ndemo, a member of the committee, said their investigations found that nearly all youths are addicted to alcohol.He said the problem has further been compounded by jigger infestation because of poor hygiene.&ldquo;Alcohol in Central Kenya was not a sporting event but was used as a celebration. There were guidelines on how to do it, but, sadly, today, its drunk every day,&rdquo; Ndemo said. He added that the majority of youths &ldquo;have become zombies, hence cannot perform their duties&rdquo;. Ndemo called for concerted efforts to deal with the problems, adding, &ldquo;Church leaders should come out boldly to condemn alcohol abuse.&rdquo; He expressed concern that youths who finnd solace in alcohol often join organised gangs and end up committing crime &mdash; murder, robbery and rape. Ndemo said the proceeds they get from criminal activities are &ldquo;reinvested&rdquo; in alcohol and other drugs. Ndemo warned that a generation could be wiped out if nothing is done.Similar sentiments were shared by chairman Joseph Kaguthi, who said the family unit is under siege because of rising alcoholism.Kaguthi said the community&rsquo;s culture has decayed and must be stopped from becoming a catastrophe.&ldquo;Even founding President Jomo Kenyatta saw this clearly and warned that what the Western world brought would have consequences,&rdquo; he said.Youth leader Joachim Njui said the formation of several cultural organisations in Central Kenya affects the way of life of their followers.&ldquo;Cultural formations like GEMA, Kiama Kiama, Gikuyu Cultural Association speak differently for one community,&rdquo; He said, adding that all the organisations should be collapsed into one body.
