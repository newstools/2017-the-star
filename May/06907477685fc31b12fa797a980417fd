Some youth leaders in Kitui want former CS Charity Ngilu (pictured) to shelve her plans to challenge Governor Julius Malombe for the seat.In a statement circulated to the media on Tuesday after a meeting at a Kitui hotel, the youth said Ngilu cannot beat Malombe at the August 8 polls. They urged her to instead negotiate to serve as Malombe&rsquo;s deputy governor.The statement was signed by Mike Munyao, the chairman of the Kitui Youth Caucus and the organisation&rsquo;s secretary general Eric Kyallo. &ldquo;We, the youth of Kitui county, are asking Ngilu to team up with Malombe to stem undue political competition for the good of the county,&rdquo; the statement said.The youth said a Malombe-Nilu team would lead to the county&rsquo;s prosperity. &ldquo;We have seen the tremendous positive transformation Malombe&rsquo;s leadership has spurred in Kitui,&rdquo; the statement added. The decision to ask Ngilu to join Malombe&rsquo;s bandwagon was arrived at during a meeting of representatives from across the county. &ldquo;We resolved that Ngilu must either be a deputy governor or step down and be given a ministry in the county government.&rdquo; The youth said Malombe&rsquo;s administration had economically empowered most young people in Kitui. &ldquo;It is for these reasons that we throw our support behind Malombe,&rdquo; the youths said.&ldquo;We ask Ngilu to join the winning team before a [political] tsunami crushes her.&rdquo;
