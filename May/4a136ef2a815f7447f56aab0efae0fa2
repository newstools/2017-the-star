Eastleigh hawkers have begun moving to a new market space on First Avenue after a lengthy standoff with mall owners who wanted them out of the streets.The market was established after the hawkers were evicted in March, after losing a case seeking court intervention to allow them to stay.The Eastleigh Business Association said they blocked footpaths and traded on the doorsteps of members&rsquo; shops, which denied them business besides making the malls inaccessible.The hawkers had taken over major roads. Yesterday traders at the malls said the hawkers must be content with the market. But hawker Joseph Mutua said their customers do not know where to find the market. Jeff Oteba, chairman of the Eastleigh Hawkers&rsquo; Association, said they will go back to court today for a solution. He said business is slow at the market.
