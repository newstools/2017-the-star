IT seems all is not well in Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero’s campaign team. Corridors has it the governor’s 2013 campaign team is said to be unhappy with the new team Kidero (pictured) has assembled. Some have expressed their anger in a WhatsApp group, accusing the new head of campaigns of sidelining them and concentrating on boardroom meetings instead of “hitting the ground”. === Word has it that a good number of people vying as independent candidates or on smaller parties in the opposition strongholds are splashing around a lot of money, claiming that they are funded by one of the top officials in the Executive. It is said these boasts have caused tension throughout NASA - and elsewhere. Isn’t it high time this top operative came out and cleared the air on this extremely sensitive issue? === A legislator from Western was heard complaining about how his community has been left out of the political arrangement in Nairobi. He protested to his fellow tribesmen that despite being the second largest community in Nairobi, they have got only two parliamentary slots while their “cousins” have taken the lion’s share. The Mbunge said not only did NASA have a Luo candidate and a Kamba running mate in the race for State House, but the same arrangement was replicated in Nairobi, the second most influential position in terms of political weight. === Two economists were engaged in a heated debate at a Nairobi hotel yesterday about the merits of the government subsidising unga. The money minded individuals questioned whether there exists a policy on such things, and who was responsible for the policy. One even questioned whether the public should not get tax rebates for all the unga they bought at high prices, but were in agreement that the body in charge of the strategic grain reserve was not doing its job properly. === A female top government officer is the talk of the town. Reason? She was reportedly asked to disembark from the presidential plane to the United Kingdom last week. It is not clear why the official was turned away from the trip. However, she was reportedly told to simply “return to work” by top state operatives. This was moments before President Uhuru Kenyatta entered the plane. She is rumoured to have a troubled working relationship with her boss. It is whispered that she had been transferred and issued with a letter, but she has reportedly refused to budge.
