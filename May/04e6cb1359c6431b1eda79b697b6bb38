President Uhuru Kenyatta and NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga are among the 16,140 candidates who have submitted their self-declaration form for clearance to the EACC ahead of the August 8 polls.In April, the commission directed all contestants to attach copies of identification documents, Kenya Revenue Authority PIN certificates and academic documents so it can conduct a background check on the information submitted to ensure candidates meet the requirements of Chapter Six of the Constitution on leadership and integrity.The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission is mandated to clear aspirants who have submitted their self-declaration forms, which should be duly filled with all information and sworn before a magistrate or commissioner for oaths.The EACC says 11 of those who have presented their forms are presidential aspirants. Another 263 want to be governors, 91 deputy governors, 1,964 MP, 333 senator aspirants, 361 woman representative hopefuls and 12,913 MCA contestants.However, this number adds up to 15,936 aspirants who have submitted the forms, not the total 16,140 given by the EACC.Information required in the declaration form includes whether an aspirant has ever engaged in any dishonest conduct of public affairs, abused a public office, misrepresented information to the public, engaged in wrongful conduct whilst in furtherance of personal benefit or misused public resources.EACC chairman Eliud Wabukala yesterday said, &ldquo;We will forward our recommendations to the IEBC on those candidates who have not met the integrity test and they will be expected to act on it.&rdquo;He spoke during the launch of an Action Plan aimed at strengthening collaboration and partnerships with faith-based institutions in the fight against graft.EACC PROGRESSWabukala said the commission has successfully recovered assets worth Sh335 million that had previously been looted.He was responding to criticism on the commission&rsquo;s reluctance to act on corrupt individuals.&ldquo;We have blocked more than Sh1.6 billion from being stolen, opened charges against 1,340 public officers and more than 400 cases are pending in court,&rdquo; Wabukala said.In the partnership with religious organisations, the commission is set to spend Sh173 million in sensitisation against corruption.The partnership will include development of preaching and teaching guidelines in all religious institutions.The EACC will further establish commission offices in each county.It will also review anti-corruption laws and finalise the anti-corruption policy.The process is set to take seven months and is set to end in December.
