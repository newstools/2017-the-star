The rapid growth in access to financial services,largely driven by mobile money innovation, has failed to reverse rising poverty levels, a high-level financial inclusion forum heard yesterday in Nairobi.KCB Group CEO Joshua Oigara told the Euromoney Conference that &ldquo;the level of inclusion has gone up but the poverty level has increased five per cent&rdquo; in recent years.Findings of the 2016 FinAccess household survey show that Kenya&rsquo;s financial inclusion has grown significantly in the last 10 years from 26.7 per cent in 2006 to 75.3 per cent as at the end of 2016.&ldquo;Within three and a half years, global efforts in financial inclusion have reached 700 million of the 2.2 billion unbanked individuals due to mobile and internet banking,&rdquo; World Bank senior vice president for the 2030 Development Agenda Mahmoud Moheildin said. &ldquo;There is however no evidence that financial inclusion contributes positively to economic growth.&rdquo;Deloitte&rsquo;s Kenya Economic Outlook 2016 report showed that about 9.3 per cent of persons qualified for employment in the country are jobless. Deloitte put Kenya&rsquo;s poverty rate at more than 40 per cent.&ldquo;There are still barriers in that this does not directly translate to better living standards,&rdquo; Central Bank of Kenya&rsquo;s governor Patrick Njoroge said during the forum yesterday. He said Kenya should focus on financial deepening to reduce the rate of poverty. This could be done through innovation in products that compliment mobile banking and allow medium and small business owners to go up the financial scale.&ldquo;Although this may take away from existing providers, there is need for the innovation of products and services related to savings, pensions, agriculture funding and health in order to reach everyone, including the lady selling groceries on the streets,&rdquo; Njoroge said.Oigara highlighted the need for provision of credit on a real-time basis to cater to the modern-day consumer. This would enhance credit uptake among small, medium and risky business owners who have been hardest hit by interest rate cap.Standard Chartered Bank chief economist for Africa Razia Khan said there is need to increase cyber security measures due to the high dependency on mobile economy.
