Just before the long rains peaked last month, the head of neglected tropical diseases in Kenya, Dr Sultani Matendechero, had a hunch dengue fever would hit.He had successfully overseen medication of at least 1.5 million people around the coast to fight elephantiasis, a stubborn disease that swells limbs, including men&rsquo;s testicles.But he knew dengue fever infections would spike.The problem is, this disease does not have celebrity fundraisers, unlike malaria. It is not feared in the way elephantiasis or HIV are, and yet dengue fever can kill.It was previously known as breakbone fever, owing to the excruciating muscle and joint pain inflicted by the severe strain, and some sufferers claimed they felt like their bones were breaking.By yesterday, at least 352 people in Mombasa county were confirmed to have the feverish disease with a short, difficult name.It has no cure and no vaccine to prevent it, and many Kenyans are worried.&ldquo;This is something we were expecting because of the rains. We are in touch with counties, we are trying to organise resources to stop the spread,&rdquo; Dr Matendechero says.AWARENESS CAMPAIGNIn prior occurrences, dengue was largely controlled, but infections originating from neighbouring countries persisted in northern Kenya.There was an outbreak in Mombasa in 2013, after the last reported incidence in the 1980s.While malaria rates have fallen to just eight per cent in Kenya, according to the Health ministry, there is a fear dengue is seeing a dramatic upsurge.Dr Matendechero says, luckily, the outbreak comes after the ministry conducted a massive awareness campaign at the coast.&ldquo;We are not surprised by the new outbreak. We shouldn&rsquo;t be very worried about it. We have been having a one-year research in Mombasa and have increased awareness in the county. We provided test kits and taught people not to confuse it with malaria,&rdquo; he says.Mombasa Health executive Khadija Shikelly confirmed they are running the rapid diagnostic tests at Aga Khan Hospital, Al Farouk, Jocham and Seyyid Fatima hospitals.&ldquo;We need to respond effectively and in a coordinated approach to contain this outbreak,&rdquo; Dr Shikely said in a memo to county health departmental heads.Matendechero says the 500 kits have high sensitivity and can test for current and past exposure.&ldquo;Those exposed before and are found to have current infection need to be monitored because reinfection can lead to severe dengue,&rdquo; he says.The ministry has conducted studies in Mvita, Tudor, Ganjoni and Coast General Hospital to monitor the disease pattern.&ldquo;We conducted sero-survey in November last year. Everybody who came with fever was subjected to dengue fever tests. We have been conducting active epidemiological surveillance in March and April this year,&rdquo; he says.Active surveillance is often used if an outbreak has begun or is suspected to keep track of the number of cases.Dr Matendechero says the outcome report, which is being compiled, will inform the government&rsquo;s response.SYMPTOMS AND RECOVERYAccording to the World Health Organisation, infected humans serve as a source of the dengue virus for uninfected female mosquito of Aedes aegypti, the same species that transmits yellow fever and the Zika infection.The infected mosquito is capable of transmitting the virus for the rest of its life.After a person is bitten by the infected mosquito, it takes between one and two weeks for symptoms to develop.The symptoms include a high body temperature of up to 40&deg;C, headache, nausea, vomiting, rash and pain in the eyes, joints, and muscles.In severe cases, symptoms may include intense stomach pain, repeated vomiting bleeding from the nose or gums or the patient&rsquo;s blood pressure may go very low such that the blood is unable to circulate.Most people recover after two to seven days, and they develop partial immunity.Dr Andrew Githeko, the chief research officer at Kenya Medical Research Institute&rsquo;s centre for global health research, says there is no cure for dengue fever, but researchers are testing vaccines.&ldquo;There was a vaccine approved by Mexico in 2015, but it is still uncertain how widely it will be deployed because of limits to its effectiveness and national budgets,&rdquo; he says.The vaccine reduced the risk of developing dengue by about 60 per cent during clinical trials, but experts say this is much less effective than what is desired.It was also least effective in children younger than nine, and was even seen to increase the risk of those children having more severe diseases in the long run, according to a longer-term follow-up from the clinical trials.Dr Githeko says because there is no medicine to cure dengue fever, doctors only treat the symptoms.He says prevention still remains the best way to fight the disease. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s typically an urban disease. Mostly, it is found in urban areas because the Aedes aegypti mosquito breeds in containers. People who live in areas of low environmental sanitation are most at risk,&rdquo; he says.&ldquo;If you store water, please cover that water. When it rains, this can amplify the breeding sites,&rdquo; he says.FOUR DENGUE TYPESThe Aedes aegypti mosquito breeds mostly in man-made containers. Unlike other mosquitoes, this type is a day-time feeder; its peak biting periods are early in the morning and in the evening before dusk. Female Aedes aegypti bites multiple people during each feeding period.Dr Githeko says people often build immunity to a particular strain when they recover from infection, but reinfection with another strain is more dangerous.&ldquo;Being exposed to dengue multiple times can increase the risk of severe dengue disease,&rdquo; he says.Certain chronic diseases &mdash; including asthma, sickle cell anemia, and diabetes mellitus &mdash; can also increase a person&rsquo;s risk of developing a severe form of the disease.While the normal dengue fever has no risk of death, death can occur if a patient has dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome.In moderate DHF cases, all signs and symptoms abate after the fever subsides. But in severe cases, the patient&rsquo;s condition may suddenly deteriorate after a few days of fever; the temperature drops, followed by signs of circulatory failure, and the patient may rapidly go into a critical state of shock.The dengue shock syndrome is characterised by bleeding that may appear as tiny spots of blood on the skin and larger patches of blood under the skin.Patients with shock recover following appropriate medical treatment, but otherwise can die within 12 to 24 hours.Dr Matendechero says these two severe forms of the disease have not been reported in Kenya yet. &ldquo;We have four types of dengue virus. If you&rsquo;re infected by one type, you produce antibodies and are immune to that type. It&rsquo;s your antibodies that produce the severe reaction when you&rsquo;re infected with another strain,&rdquo; he says.He says the outbreaks usually spike in the rainy season. &ldquo;The second elevated infections come with the short rains in November,&rdquo; he says.&ldquo;We are testing and so far, we haven&rsquo;t found any case of reinfection in Mombasa.&rdquo;As for pronunciation of the name dengue, history has it that it is a corruption of Swahili ki denga pepo, meaning &ldquo;cramp-like seizure caused by an evil spirit&rdquo;.
