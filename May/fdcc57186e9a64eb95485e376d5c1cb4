Kisii Governor James Ongwae has defended his development record during his first term in office and asked residents to reelect him.Ongwae said the county has notable developments in health, education, roads and agriculture, among other sectors.He was speaking to more than 400 primary school head teachers from the county at a Nakuru hotel on the sidelines of the KEPSHA regional delegates conference on Friday.Ongwae said he is confident of retaining his seat at the August 8 polls, adding he needs more time to fully implement his development agenda. Highlighting his achievements, Ongwae said he put in place a governance structure in Kisii, and the county is ready for takeoff.&ldquo;Though education is not a fully devolved function, my administration organised the first ever Kisii County Education Conference where we evaluated our standards and laid strategies to better our performance in exams,&rdquo; Ongwae said. He said the County Education Bursary was borne out of the conference, and is now paying fees for thousands of needy but bright pupils.&ldquo;The kitty has so far disbursed Sh450 million to needy children, the highest in the country. We hope to increase it so that more can benefit. No child should stay out of school for lack of fees,&rdquo; the county boss said.He said each of the 45 wards is given Sh5 million. Ongwae said the recruitment of more than 1,500 caregivers and the construction of two ECDE classrooms in each ward has increased enrollment of pupils.KEPSHA Kisii county chairman David Aming&rsquo;a thanked Ongwae for meeting the teachers, and pledged their support for him. The governor will faceoff with Senator Chris Obure of Jubilee Party, South Mugirango MP Manson Nyamweya (KNC) and Wiper&rsquo;s Lumumba Nyaberi.
