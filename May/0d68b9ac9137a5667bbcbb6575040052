Kakamega assembly minority leader Titus Kwoma has said Governor Wycliffe Oparanya should be investigated and blocked from seeking reelection over alleged &ldquo;misappropriation of millions of shillings&rdquo; by his government. Speaking in Kakamega town yesterday, Kwoma said the assembly Public Accounts and Investment Committee report on the Auditor General&rsquo;s findings on county spending unearthed massive misuse of funds. The report states the Sh200 million Kakamega Sugar Development Fund disbursed to a private company instead of Mumias during the 2014-15 financial year remains unaccounted for. The assembly suspended debate on the PAIC report, claiming some MCAs had been bribed to shoot it down. Kwoma said Mumias Distributors has only returned Sh15 million, leaving a balance of Sh46 million, along with interest.
