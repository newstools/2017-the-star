Lugari MP Ayub Savula yesterday said the high number of independent candidates will pose a serious threat to the National Assembly if a majority of them win.Savula said a victory by most independents will put party primaries to test. They will have proved that nomination by political parties were not credible and an abuse of democracy.&ldquo;The real danger is that they could decide to form a caucus of independent candidates in Parliament if many of them are elected. This could frustrate business on both sides of the House as either government or opposition will have to negotiate with them on their terms,&rdquo; he said. The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission has cleared 4,000 independent candidates for various elective seats in the August poll. This is going to be the highest number of independent candidates to take part in a general election in Kenya since independence. Among those cleared, 11 are seeking the presidency, 31 want to become senators, 27 governors, 215 MPs and 14 want to become woman representatives. The bulk of the independent candidates is seeking to be MCAs.Party nomination officially ended on Monday. They were marred by complaints by aspirants who claimed to have been shortchanged by the parties. This overwhelmed dispute resolution mechanisms with petitions that stretched into the deadline for the nomination by the IEBC.
