The majority of young people who were forced to stop drinking when dangerous brews were destroyed are returning to the vice. They were not trained on any income-generating activities to keep them busy, an NGO has said.Wells of Hope Education Ministries has said illegal brewers are taking advantage and have started producing more liquor and selling it secretly.WHEM director Jeddiah Wanyeki on Monday said young people are targeted by the brewers who want to make money but don&rsquo;t care about their future. &ldquo;Women have protested over their husbands and sons drunkenness. Dangerous brews have been destroyed and sale of drugs such as bhang are opposed. But sellers do not care. They keep coming back without considering the impact,&rdquo; she said at Kirathimo social hall in Limuru town. She addressed more than 50 recovering alcoholics. Wanyeki said WHEM plans to start counselling and artisan courses for the reformed youth. &ldquo;We are targeting those who do not have any course and had been destroyed by brews and drugs,&rdquo; she said. Wanyeki was with WHEM chief executive Joyce Mugambi who said they have bought a 7-acre plot in Tiekunu, Ndeiya, where they will build an institution for reformed youth.
