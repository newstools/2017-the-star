Sylvia Amuguni is an AP who works in the Embakasi AP Training College as a fitness instructor, but one thing that stands out about her is her art.The 27-year-old uses pencil and oil to draw. Her art piece of President Uhuru Kenyatta went viral."I drew that photo a while back, in 2014. At the time I was in the recruits choir. We performed for him and that is when he came close enough for me to see his colour scheme," Sylvia told Word Is. "Of course it is hard to meet the President, but the portrait I drew of his was given to him by my good bosses at the just-concluded pass out. I was away on official duties. I guess I'm the first female ever to do a portrait of him. I was informed that he was happy and wanted to see me, but as I said earlier, I was on a duty call somewhere."If she was to ever meet Uhuru, she says she would tell him of her grand scheme to empower youth with the gift of drawing."We can support and empower many youths to have better livelihoods. Given a chance, I would develop and give out free tutorials to save many of our perishing youth. Holding hands with reformed criminals, sharing their experiences and testimonies can assist in curbing crime."
