Kiambu Governor William Kabogo will make a major political statement next Thursday. He spoke on Wednesday for the first time since he was floored in the Jubilee Party primaries by Kabete MP Ferdinand Waititu. Kabogo said he will give his views about the events that led to his surprise loss and announce plans for his political future. Pollsters rated the governor ahead of his rivals, giving indications that he would win the JP ticket. He, however, unexpectedly lost by a huge margin. Waititu was declared winner of the preliminary poll with 358,604 votes against Kabogo’s 69,916. Kabogo’s statement will include whether he will defend his seat as an independent. He told reporters that a large number of his supporters are keen to see him on the ballot. “My supporters have been pushing me to vie. I will clear all that next week,” Kabogo said. There have been claims that Kabogo intends to join a team of politicians, who lost in the Jubilee nominations, to form a movement that will give independent candidates a voice. However, the county boss, accompanied by Deputy Governor Gerald Githinji, dismissed them as “empty rumours”. Kabogo was inspecting the construction of a modern labour ward in Thika Level-5 Hospital. This was his first official duty and public appearance after the party polls. The reproductive health unit will be up and running by the beginning of next month. He expressed pride in what his administration has achieved, especially in healthcare, saying all that is meant to improve residents’ lives. “Kiambu has been rated amongst the best counties in terms of healthcare. We want to maintain that lead,” Kabogo said.
