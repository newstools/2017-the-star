Njuri Nceke elders have, for the second time, placed a curse on Jacob Kaimenyi saying he has fueled division among them.A splinter group in Meru county performed the rituals against the Lands CS at Nchiru shrine in Tigania West on Saturday.Secretary general Josephat Murangiri and chairman Linus Kathera accused Kaimenyi of supporting another splinter group."We are the ones who lobbied for Kaimenyi to be appointed Cabinet Secretary. We urge President Uhuru Kenyatta to sack him and replace him with someone else," the elders said.They added that they will march to State House should Uhuru not fire the CS by June 14.The elders also cursed Chuka University Vice Chancellor Elias Njoka, claiming he also caused a split in the council. They said he and Kaimenyi used their positions to divide a group formed more than 100 years ago.Salesio M'ngechu, the council's Igembe central chairman, said the two colluded with ousted council leaders Phares Rutere and Paul M'ithinkia. He said they tainted the name of the council, an offence which "warrants excommunication".The elders first cursed Kaimenyi in May 2015 after he failed to honour summons over "controversial" remarks about the council. The CS had to part with a white, spotless bull and Sh100,000 in cash on July 7 that year for the curse to be lifted.More on this: Njuri Ncheke curses CS Kaimenyi, brands him an outcastAlso read: Meru elders meet in shrine to discuss push for Kaimenyi removalKaimenyi said on Saturday that it was wrong for the elders to curse him and demand that the President fire him."They are not the ones who appointed me...the President did...if he finds me unfit he can sack...they cannot tell him what to do," he said at Meru National Polytechnic.Kaimenyi added that the council is to blame for its misfortunes as it has forced old men to join."We know a council does not force people to join...people are selected and asked to join at their own will," he said and questioned Njuri Nceke's legitimacy."They are not recognised by the Registrar of Societies," he said. "They went to court against the council's norms to make matters worse. What kind of council roots for its own people's downfall."Kaimenyi said he was ready to mediate for the council's splinter groups to be reunited."Njuri Nceke is very respected in the country but this will no longer be the case if a few individuals do not exercise concern."
