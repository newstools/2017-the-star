The written prayer NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga was seen yesterday inserting in the cracks of the historical Wailing Wall of Israel will be buried after two years.Visitors to Jerusalem often squeeze written prayers in the cracks of the Western Wall.But what happens when the crevices get full?According to Israel&rsquo;s CBN News, twice a year, the prayer slips are removed from the cracks between the old stones and no one is allowed to read the slips because they are notes between man and his Creator.For many centuries, Jews came to pray at the wall, both for individual requests and for the rebuilding of the temple and the return of sovereignty to the Jewish people.Political and religious figures have left notes in the wall, including Pope John Paul II, many entertainers and heads of state.CBN News says more than a million notes are placed in the wall each year, and twice a year, the rabbi of the Western Wall collects the notes and buries them in a dedicated area of the Mount of Olives cemetery.According to Jewish religious practice, it is forbidden to destroy anything on which the name of God is written.That means these little prayer slips are treated with the same respect as worn or damaged Torah scrolls and prayer books.Raila was spotted walking in the footsteps of the Biblical Joshua at the site wearing a kippah and holding a Bible. A kippah can be worn conveniently under a street hat, as was the custom for most Jews in the first half of the 20th century.When Raila was named the opposition presidential candidate, he said he would be the Joshua who would deliver Kenyans from their hardships.He and his running mate Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper) will face President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto of the Jubilee Party at the ballot.The opposition chief, who travelled to Israel on Sunday, delivered an address on democratisation, religion and the pursuit of peace in Africa at the Truman Institute.He said on his Twitter handle, &ldquo;Few know my history with this Holy Site. The Western Wall is the pulpit of the Temple of Solomon and is said to have been built over 5,000 years ago. The site is sacred to all three Abrahamic religions - Judaism, Islam and Christianity - and to me it is a very strong symbolism of strength and unity. The story goes that you write your wish on a piece of paper, stick it on the wall and say a prayer and the message goes directly to God.&rdquo;The ODM leader said he began the tradition of writing his wishes while he was in detention, as it is a &ldquo;miserable place with time mostly spent alone&rdquo;. Raila was detained for six years without trial over the failed 1982 coup against then President Daniel Moi. He was charged with treason. Before this, he had been under house arrest for seven months.Raila said he spent 23 hours a day alone and that at the time, it would take six months to exchange letters with his family. &ldquo;With a lot of time on my hands, I used to write down the many wishes I had for the people of Kenya. Every time I visit, I take one of those wishes and place it on the wall.&rdquo;
