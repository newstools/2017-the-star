A major in the technical flying unit at Moi Airbase, Nairobi, has been sued by his wife for the second time for failing to pay Sh4.2 million upkeep for their three children as ordered by the court.Major Douglas ole Loina is accused of abandoning his parental responsibilities, despite being a man of means.The matter was filed in 2008. In 2011, the court ordered Loina to pay Sh50,000 a month to his wife Mercy for the children&rsquo;s upkeep. The money has accumulated to Sh4.2 million, since Loina failed to obey the orders.The court has had trouble handling the case since the man has never appeared in person and has only sent advocates.When the matter came for a mention on Friday, Loina had no counsel to represent him.Mercy said they have only separated, not divorced. The matter will be mentioned on June 16.
