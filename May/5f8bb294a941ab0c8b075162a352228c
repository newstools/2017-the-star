The Communications Authority has warned about a cyber attack that is targeting computers around the world and has advised Kenyans to exercise caution to avoid falling victim. The encryption based cyber attack manifests itself as &ldquo;ransonware&rdquo; and attacks computers running on Windows operating system.The malicious software infects a computer and restricts user access until a ransom is paid to unlock it.&ldquo;Once a computer is infected with the virus, it tries to infect other computers in the same network. Individuals and organizations are discouraged from paying the ransom as this does not guarantee access will be restored,&rdquo; CA Director General Francis Wangusi said in a statement. Wangusi said the ransom virus that also goes by the name WannaCry, WannaCrypt0r or WannaDecrypt0r has already infected thousands of computers around the world.He said its existence has been confirmed by the National Kenya Computer Incidence Response Team Coordination Centre ( KE-CIRT-CC).&ldquo;The Authority is therefore advising the public to beware and put in place the following preventive measures,&rdquo; Wangusi said. He advised that individuals and organizations should ensure their computers have updated anti-virus as well as an offline data back-up system. &ldquo;This will ensure that in the event your computer is attacked, you can restore your files from the back-up.&rdquo;The CA boss also advised against clicking on links or opening files and email attachments from unknown sources.He said people should also look out for attachments that recommend one to enable macros in order to view a file.&ldquo;Unless you trust the source, do not enable macros. Instead, delete the email immediately and permanently,&rdquo; Wangusi said.Wangusi did not however specify whether the presence of the malware has been reported in Kenya.
