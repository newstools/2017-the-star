The government has launched a trip management system for fleet owners to stem accidents.Pioneer Road Safety Consultants have developed Checkmate. The service seeks to help commercial road operators plan, monitor and evaluate trips.Through a series of checkpoints and road patrols, initially along the Northern Corridor, Checkmate will provide services to commercial providers of road transport.They include the use of GPS (Global Positioning System) tracking to monitor driver behaviour and performance between checkpoints.At each checkpoint, drivers will be expected to undergo a thorough performance review, besides being observed and randomly tested for alcohol levels. Other components of the service suite include a mandatory 15-minute rest at each checkpoint, a record of hazards between checkpoints by the driver and advice on the same and vehicle inspection to ensure compliance. &ldquo;Poorly planned and unmonitored road trips are the bane of our roads. They spawn many road safety breaches like speeding, which often result in traffic crashes, fatalities and injuries,&rdquo; said National Transport Safety Authority managing director Francis Mejja.He said the authority is implementing many initiatives to improve safety on Kenyan roads and reduce injuries and fatalities while ensuring transporters&rsquo; businesses remain viable.Pioneer Road Safety Consultants&rsquo; managing director Habel Okema said the platform has already been subscribed by several heavy commercial road transport firms for both passenger and cargo.The NTSA latest data show at least 941 Kenyans have died in traffic accidents since the year began, against a figure of 1,025 for the same period last year, with a majority of them being pedestrians. Twenty-seven people died on April 27 after their bus collided with a tanker on the Nairobi-Mombasa highway at Kalulu Bridge. Nineteen others were seriously injured when the accident occurred at 2.50am between Kambu and Nthange.Most suffered broken ribs, legs, hands and had gash head wounds. They were admitted at Makindu and Kibwezi subcounty hospitals.The bus driver was trying to overtake another vehicle when it collided head-on with the tanker that was transporting vegetable oil.Twenty-four people died on the spot, while three others died on arrival in hospital.
