A pregnant US teenager branded "immoral" by her school and barred from its graduation ceremony is to have her own event, organised by her parents.Maddi Runkles, 18, who attends a small private Christian school in Maryland, has been told she is not welcome at the event, on 2 June, because she must be "accountable for her immorality".Instead, her parents have decided to organise a special party for their daughter the following day.The decision by the board of governors of the Heritage Academy, in Hagerstown, has drawn criticism on social media from those who say the school is showing no Christian compassion to the teenager."Heritage Academy has opportunity to demonstrate love &amp; grace of Jesus. Instead choosing judgement &amp; shame," tweeted @WineyKnitter.And "proud Christian" Ta Mika wrote: "The Bible says all fall short of god's glory. What happened to truth and grace?"Runkles, who had been president of the student council, is among the highest academic achievers in her year.The teenager told CBS she had briefly considered having an abortion but "did the right thing" in deciding to keep her baby, a boy.Various people lobbied on behalf of Runkles, including her father, who eventually resigned as president of the school board over the matter.'She was immoral'Scott Runkles had still been on the board when his daughter was suspended for two days but stepped aside from being directly involved in the decision about her attendance at the graduation ceremony.Runkles, a bank vice-president, told the New York Times: "Typically, when somebody breaks a rule, you punish them at the time they break the rule."That way, the punishment is behind them, and they're moving forward with a clean slate."With Maddi, her punishment was set four months out."It's ruined her senior year."
