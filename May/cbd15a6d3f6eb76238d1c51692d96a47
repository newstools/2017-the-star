MPs cannot be relied on to control food prices as they are busy trying to defend their seats as independents after being frustrated by their parties, Nairobi Senate aspirant John Wamagata has said. Wamagata, the Safina party director of elections, said, &ldquo;You cannot expect to get help from angry people. In fact, they will frustrate you further. Some, especially those in JP, were expecting Uhuru to help them get the tickets,&rdquo; he said. Meeting Safina candidates and their supporters in Kikuyu town on Wednesday, Wamagata asked Uhuru to call a sitting to discuss lowering food prices and allow Finance CS Henry Rotich to table the matter at a Cabinet meeting. &ldquo;We are in talks with other civil society groups that if something won&rsquo;t be done to lower maize flour, sugar, maize and beans prices, we will led a very strong protest in the streets of Nairobi,&rdquo; he said.
