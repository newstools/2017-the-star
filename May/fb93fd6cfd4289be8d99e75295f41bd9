Rice production is expected to increase with the development of 15 hybrid varieties capable of yielding up to four tonnes per hectare.The varieties, developed by the African Agricultural Technology Foundation, can double production.Project manager Sanni Kayode yesterday said the foundation aims to improve food security among small-scale rice producers.&ldquo;Three parties have come together to develop hybrid rice that can compete with imported varieties in terms of quality and affordability,&rdquo; he said. Kayode said the hybrid will help Kenya become self-sufficient.The hybrid will improve production and increases farmers&rsquo; profits, he said.Kayode spoke in Tiengre village, Kisumu West, after the hybrid rice was harvested.He said trails are being undertaken across the country and once approved, the rice will be distributed to farmers.He said the Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Service is monitoring the trials to determine the viability of the rice.Kayode said the seeds will only be distributed to farmers once Kephis and other agencies approve.After tests, the results will be presented to a committee, which will decide on which of the 15 hybrids can be released to seed companies.National Irrigation Board scientist Raphael Wanjogu said the initiative, if successful, will help the country bridge the rice production gap.He said the country imports 250,000 tonnes of rice annually against a production of 200,000 tonnes annually.Wanjogu said the new varieties will enable the country realise its own high yielding hybrid seeds and boost production.
