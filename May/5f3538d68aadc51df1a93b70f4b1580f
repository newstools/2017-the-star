The electoral commission is opposing a case involving the procurement of ballot papers, saying it will delay poll preparation.It has urged the court to be mindful of the fixed August 8 election date and the fact that election preparation takes a long time.&ldquo;The court should take into account social, economic and political implications of its decisions in its quest to achieve an appropriate constitutional balance,&rdquo; commission CEO Ezra Chiloba says in an affidavit.He urges the court to allow the IEBC to continue with the procurement of election material using the most appropriate method provided by law.IEBC says it should not be boxed into choosing a specific mode of procurement when the law gives it options.The commission was responding to a case filed against it by Cecil James Oyugi.In his suit papers, Oyugi faults the decision by the procurement board, which annulled the tendering process, saying it will compel the IEBC to single source.Judge George Odunga, after hearing Oyugi, suspended the board&rsquo;s decision.The case will be heard today.
