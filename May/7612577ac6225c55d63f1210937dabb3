The ODM Party has refuted claims that nominated MP Oburu Oginga has been fronted for the East Africa Legislative Assembly (EALA) slot. In a statement by Dennis Onyango, Party leader Raila Odinga's spokesman, the party had considered to nominate Oburu, but he rejected the offer.&ldquo;Dr Oginga formally declined this offer last week and instead asked the Party to give priority to one of those whose nominations were shot down by Jubilee last time,&rdquo; Onyango said on Sunday night.This comes after information surfaced that Raila's elder brother as well as Wiper Party leader and NASA running mate Kalonzo Musyoka's firstborn son Kennedy Musyoka had applied for the EALA positions.The EALA is an organ of the East African Community and has a wide-ranging mandate on top of being the legislative organ of the Community. Oburu, 74, is among the longest-serving MPs and was recently trounced in the ODM primaries for the Bondo parliamentary seat.He was nominated to the current Parliament after a failed attempt to clinch the Siaya gubernatorial seat at the 2013 polls.Those eying the EALA nomination through Jubilee are Dr Julius Kones, who lost in the Bomet primaries, and ex-Kamukunji MP Simon Mbugua.President Uhuru Kenyatta's Jubilee Party has five slots of the available nine.Read: Oburu Oginga, Onyango Oloo lose in Bondo, Kisumu ODM primaries as incumbents retain seats
