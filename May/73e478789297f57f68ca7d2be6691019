The appointment of governors to lead the NASA presidential campaigns in the counties draws mixed reactions, especially in Homa Bay.Governor Cyprian Awiti was appointed to lead campaigns in the county after he was awarded the ODM certificate despite rigging allegations by opponent Sammy Wakiaga.Homa Bay Senator Moses Kajwang said the campaigns should not be left entirely to the governors.He said NASA should set up lean campaign committees, bringing together major county stakeholders, to spearhead the exercise.Kajwang said some governors could mix their personal campaign agenda with the presidential one.&ldquo;This might not go well with supporters of other governor candidates and might not yield much positive results for NASA,&rdquo; he said.Homa Bay ODM youth leader Oloo Gor said the party should have appointed someone who had not participated in the disputed party primaries to unite winners and losers. He said there might be voter apathy among voters whose preferred candidates lost.
