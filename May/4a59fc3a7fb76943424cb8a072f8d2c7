A Nyanza man whose wife is a die-hard supporter of ODM leader Raila Odinga will only get his estranged wife back if the NASA presidential candidate wins the election. In a video that has gone viral, the man jokingly tells of his plight while washing dishes in the company of a friend. He has been taking care of his children and doing house chores since his wife left 10 years ago. The man's friend says his wife abandoned him after the Opposition leader lost the presidential election. He adds: "His wife...has promised to come back only if the NASA flag bearer wins this year's election." Raila and his running mate Kalonzo Musyoka will vie against President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto who want a second term. The ODM leader unsuccessfully ran for president in 1997, 2007 and 2013. This year's election has been termed his last chance and he said he will not complain of rigging again. The friend then asks the man if he will remarry or remain single should Raila lose again. The man may be lonely but says he has no problem washing dishes and taking care of his children. "I will continue washing dishes until Raila wins. My wife and kids will come back only after Tinga wins the presidential seat," he says.
