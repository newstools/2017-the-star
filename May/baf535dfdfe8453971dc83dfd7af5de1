Mully Half Marathon in Kenya and Ontario Marathon in Canada have entered a partnership that will see winners from the two events benefit from an exchange programme.Nick Brindisi, who is also a member of the organising committee of Ontario Marathon, said he was keen on executing the partnership deal after his attendance and participation in the inaugural Mully 21km race in Yatta two weeks ago. &ldquo;Under the partnership, top finishers in the Mully Half marathon will be entered in the Ontario Marathon while their counterparts from the Canadian race will run in the Kenyan race,&rdquo; Brindisi said. He said if this works, they will consider extending the partnership to Bermuda and Tel Aviv marathons.Brindisi said the initiative for the Mully Half Marathon was mooted 10 years ago by a group of Canadians called &lsquo;Old Guys in Action&rsquo; to help raise funds to support Mully Children&rsquo;s Family (MCF) and nurture sporting talent. He observed that they were satisfied with the race&rsquo;s organisation and will now push for it to be a full marathon as from next year. Brindisi was speaking on Tuesday in Nairobi on, where the winners of the Mully Half Marathon were feted. Athletics Kenya (AK) senior vice chairman in charge of competitions, , Paul Mutwii, applauded the race organisers for quick payment of prize money and asked other local event organisers to embrace the same. &ldquo;As AK, we have given this race a thumbs up. However, we are cracking down on race organisers who are not paying athletes their dues and we will impose sanctions on the culprits,&rdquo; said Mutwii. Commonwealth Games women&rsquo;s marathon champion Philomena Cheyech won the women&rsquo;s race followed by Lucy Cheruiyot with Agnes Barsosio third. Sammy Dismas Nyokaye secured the men&rsquo;s bragging rights closely followed by Daniel Kipkosgei as Robert Kangogo took the bronze medal. The top three runners in both the races received Sh450,000, Sh190,000 and Sh100,000 respectively.
