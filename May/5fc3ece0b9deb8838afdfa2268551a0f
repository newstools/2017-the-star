An independent presidential aspirant wants the courts to extend the deadline for submission of forms and symbols or he will be locked out of the polls.In an urgent application at the Milimani law courts yesterday, Solomon Gichira said he submitted his documents to the IEBC as required by law on March 30 but was turned away because his symbol resembled another.He said he resubmitted another symbol, but it was also rejected. The politician says the IEBC&rsquo;s decision to reject his symbol is discriminatory, will lock him out of the election and destroy his ambition to run for President.He wants the court to compel the IEBC to acknowledge receipt of his documents so he can vie in August.Yesterday, the IEBC said the deadline for submission of application forms by independent candidates is May 8.
