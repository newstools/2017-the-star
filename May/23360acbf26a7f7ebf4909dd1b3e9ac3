NASA spent a lot of time in retreats but only managed to select the "same tired" Raila Odinga as its flag bearer, Tana River Governor Hussein Dado has said.Raila unsuccessfully vied for the top seat in 1997, 2007 and 2013. He has accused the government of "stealing" his victories.Read: Raila crafts new election strategyDismissing the coalition's power-sharing formula as a failure, Dado told his supporters on Monday that they thought the team would come up with a "proper line-up"."After the many retreats in hotels, we expected to see a foreigner," he said during a meeting at Oda in Garsen constituency on Tuesday. "There was nothing new they offered by making Raila (ODM) the flag bearer."Raila's running mate is Wiper chief Kalonzo Musyoka. Others who joined forces to form the National Super Alliance are Musalia Mudavadi (Amani National Congress), Moses Wetang'ula (Ford Kenya), and Isaac Rutto (Chama Cha Mashinani).But Dado said their agreement favoured only a certain community and that western and eastern were given a raw deal.In February, Bumula MP Boniface Otsiula said Luhyas would unanimously vote for Jubilee if Raila became flag bearer. He said they would only vote for the Opposition if Mudavadi or Wetang'ula was on the ticket."If none of our brothers is the opposition flag bearer, let no one come to Western and tell us to vote for Raila. We will be very bitter," he warned.More on this: Luhyas will unanimously vote for Jubilee if Raila is NASA flag bearer - MP OtsiulaAlso read: Luhya happy with Nasa, but Kambas grumbleThe Governor added that the proposed premier cabinet secretary positions were unconstitutional and would cost more than Sh20 billion if implemented.Mudavadi will take up the proposed premier cabinet secretary post while Wetang'ula and Rutto will serve as deputy premier cabinet secretaries, posts that will be created through an amendment to the constitution.Dado, who was elected on a Wiper ticket but moved to Jubilee, said Kalonzo failed to unite his party and therefore has nothing fresh to offer NASA."He lost [Machakos] Governor Alfred Mutua - now Maendeleo Chap Chap leader - and seven MPs," the county boss said. "I could not stay in such a house because there is no day Kalonzo will be the flag bearer."The Governor praised President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto saying they have spurred development.He dismissed claimed the Coast region is an ODM stronghold and said he will go around campaigning for the ruling coalition."If Raila has Joho, then Uhuru has Dado," he said. "We will launch an aggressive campaign for Jubilee at the Coast. We want to ensure residents vote for the party which will retain power."Among those who attended the meeting were Deputy Governor Jire Siyat, Galole MP Hassan Dukicha, Senator Ali Bule and woman representative Halima Ware, MCAs, and aspirants.
