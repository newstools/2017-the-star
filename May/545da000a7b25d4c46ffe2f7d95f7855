The state has urged communities allocated agricultural land in public forests not to destroy trees. Foreign Affairs ministry director of administration Waweru Kimani on Friday urged community forest associations to inspect forests. He said the government and the Kenya Forest Service have invested heavily in reforestation. Kimani spoke at Uplands Forest in Lari constituency. He represented CS Amina Mohamed, who was expected to lead a delegation of ministry officials in planting trees. “It is important for the CFAs to protect trees. The government has done a lot and won’t stop replanting trees to conserve the environment,” Kimani said. He was accompanied by area station forester Carol Njeru, assistant county commissioner Carol Chepkemoi and Kijabe Environment Volunteers organisation director David Kuria.
