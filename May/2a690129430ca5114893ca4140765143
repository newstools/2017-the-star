Rapper King Kaka doesn't take his job lightly. He says music is a business and as such, he should be paid top dollar for it. "We have been duped before. People don't know what it takes to make music. Studio time costs Sh3,000. I had to go sell mitumba to earn that money, and pay for my music to be produced," King Kaka said at the launch of Boomplay, a platform for downloading music legally.He said musicians are living in abject poverty because they are not being paid for their music. "It is sad when you get to see how they are living. Some haven't even paid their rent. The reality is we creatives go through so much to get content, only for it to be dubbed," King Kaka said.The platform will "monetise artists' work," app regional manager Chinasa Ideala said. "We consider ourselves a bridge between the artist and the fan by offering a platform where the music lover can have direct access to everything music."
