Kenya&rsquo;s Ruth Chepngetich and Tanzania&rsquo;s Ismail Juma were the surprise winners at the Vodafone Istanbul Half Marathon, clocking Turkish all-comers&rsquo; records of 1:06:19 and 1:00:09 at the IAAF Gold Label Road Race on Sunday.The top three in the women&rsquo;s race was decided after the first five kilometres, but the finishing order only became apparent during the final five-kilometre section.Chepngetich, Olympic marathon silver medallist Eunice Kirwa and Ethiopia&rsquo;s Worknesh Degefa went through the first five kilometres in 15:17, 51 seconds ahead of the rest of the field.Degefa was unable to sustain that pace and soon dropped back, leaving Kirwa and Chepngetich to reach the 10-kilometre mark in 31:08. The leading duo then passed through 15km in 46:59, but Kirwa struggled to keep up with Chepngetich over the final few kilometres.The 23-year-old went on to win in 1:06:19, taking 28 seconds off the Turkish all-comers&rsquo; record set in this race two years ago by 2014 world half-marathon champion Gladys Cherono. It was her fourth PB and victory in as many races this year for Chepngetich, who so far in 2017 has won in Adana (1:09:06), Paris (1:08:08) and Milan (1:07:42). Her winning time in Istanbul now puts her at 12th on the world all-time list. Kirwa suffered her first defeat since 2014 at this distance but could take some redemption from setting a Bahraini record of 1:06:46 in second place. Degefa was third in 1:08:55.The men&rsquo;s race was closer than the women&rsquo;s, but it too was also decided in just the closing stages. Perhaps due to the windy conditions at the start, a 12-man pack covered the first five kilometres in 14:22, slower than the targeted pace of 14:10. 10 men, led by Kenya&rsquo;s Vincent Yator, were still in contention at the 10-km mark, which was reached in 28:32.Yator tried to pull away over the course of the following two kilometres, but the gap closed before 15th kilometre as Juma, Ethiopia&rsquo;s Terefa Debela and Kenya&rsquo;s Edwin Kipsang Rotich joined Yator to form the leading group, with Adugna Takele in close chase.Juma reached 20km in 57:05, seven seconds ahead of Debela, and then pushed hard in an attempt to finish within 60 minutes. He just missed out on his target but crossed the finish line in a huge PB of 1:00:09, taking four seconds off the Turkish all-comers&rsquo; record set in 2015 by Evans Kiplagat. Juma, who finished ninth at the 2015 IAAF World Cross Country Championships, took more than two minutes off his PB.
