John Mututho claims five families are behind the maize shortage in the country that resulted in higher prices and branded packs by the government.The former Agriculture committee chairman said the families, which he did not name, were identified while he was in Parliament.&ldquo;The five are manipulating the prices of flour despite Parliament passing the Monopolies Act. It's time the Agriculture CS took action,&rdquo; he said.Cabinet Secretary Willy Bett said on Tuesday that the government had started a subsidy programme to provide Kenyans with cheap unga. Though temporary, the move comes as a relief to many Kenyans who have been affected by the high cost of living and skyrocketing prices of maize flour.More on this: GOK's Sh90 unga hits supermarkets but buyers limited to two packsAlso read: I will not step down, my duty is to lower prices of Unga, sugar - CS BettMututho further termed the maize shortage artificial and accused cartels of traders and millers of hoarding to control prices.The former Naivasha MP claimed on Wednesday that the cartels are in cahoots with the government.He made the claim just a day after President Uhuru Kenyatta said this was not the case and that he would make a major announcement.The government has supplied supermarkets with subsidised maize flour that costs Sh90 per 2kg pack.
