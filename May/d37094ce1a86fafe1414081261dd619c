Nandi Senator Stephen Sang yesterday expressed outrage at the deplorable state of Kapsabet Referral Hospital and other health facilities.Sang said the more than 240 facilities had been without drugs and other essential supplies for two months. He spoke after an impromptu tour of the county referral hospital to assess its state. Sang said the hospital was in the &ldquo;ICU&rdquo;.The hospitals, Sang said, were faced with many problems, including acute shortage of drugs, laboratory reagents and suppliers not being paid by the county government. When he visited the maternity wing, he said he was shocked to find two expectant mothers sharing one bed.The maternity ward has only eight beds and there are 20 deliveries daily.&ldquo;The state here is in a deplorable state. Eight beds for 20 expectant mothers is unacceptable and urgent expansion is required to arrest the situation,&rdquo; Sang said. &ldquo;As an emergency, I have negotiated with the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority with the county to avail drugs as soon as possible.&rdquo; Sang vowed to carry out &ldquo;surgery&rdquo; to rid the county of corrupt practices if elected governor in August.
