NASA principal Moses Wetang'ula will defend his Bungoma senator seat in the general election, his party Ford Kenya has announced. Bungoma secretary Peter Wakhuleka said Wetang'ula made the decision as he is irreplaceable. "It is a sealed deal. We are going to present his name to the IEBC as unopposed candidate." he said. He spoke at a press conference in Bungoma town on Sunday, which aspirants from Bungoma and Trans Nzoia counties attended. Wetang'ula will relinquish his seat, in the event that the National Super Alliance forms the next government, to take the position of deputy prime minister. This is in light of the power-sharing deal that has been submitted to the Registrar of Political Parties. Raila Odinga (ODM) and Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper) are the president and running mate candidates. ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi is proposed to take up a position that will be created after the election, and only in the event of victory, known as Premier Cabinet Secretary. The Premier Cabinet Secretary, equivalent to a chief minister, according to sources, will have the added portfolio of Internal Security and Administration of National Government. Under the Premier CS will be two powerful deputies of equal rank. One will oversee the State Department of Public Service and the other will be in charge of the State Department of Devolution and Planning. Sources indicate Rutto’s Chama Cha Mashinani will be allocated one of the two deputies to head the Devolution wing.

There had been speculation about the seat he would run for, political pundits arguing he was destined for either Bungoma senator or governor. Ford Kenya had technically reserved the senator position for him; the party did not field any other candidate in the primaries. But political analyst Isaac Wanjekeche said the declaration could complicate matters for other aspirants who declared interest in the seat, assuming Wetang'ula would not defend it. “It is going to be an easy ride for Wetang'ula to recapture his seat. This will send political wannabes who had declared the quest to succeed him into limbo,” said Wanjekeche. Among the aspirants were jounalist David Makali of ANC, Bonny Nyongesa of ODM and educationist Juma Mukhwana of Jubilee. Wanjekeche however noted that the decision for an about-turn indicates Wetang'ula is not sure of a NASA win and fears political oblivion. “Wetang'ula doesn’t want to corner himself in the political situation Raila and Kalonzo have found themselves in in the past, hence the need to devise a fall back strategy in an event of loss in August," he said. The principal did not answer calls for comment. He is said to be in Uganda.
