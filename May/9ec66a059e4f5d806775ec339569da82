Governor Jackson Mandago says he will appear before the Senate Public Accounts Committee on June 7 to answer queries raised by the Auditor General on spending of more than Sh4.5 billion in 2015-16.Mandago has denied such a huge amount could have been misused by the county. He said he will prove all the cash was used to benefit residents of Uasin Gishu. &ldquo;If such money can be misused in one year, then it means we did not pay salaries or implement any project, yet we have no salary arrears and carried out all budgeted projects,&rdquo; Mandago said.Mandago insisted he did not refuse to appear before PAC last week, but was on paternity leave and had other election campaign engagements.&ldquo;There is no way I can snub the Senate. I have been on paternityeave and had to take care of my family,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;I will appear before the Senate team armed with all evidence on how we used all the cash allocated to Uasin Gishu,&rdquo; he said on Friday in Eldoret.The Senate team turned away Deputy Governor Daniel Chemno and a team from the finance department who had had gone to represent him.
