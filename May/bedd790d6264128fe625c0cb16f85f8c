Nakuru Governor Kinuthia Mbugua and his supporters are still reeling from the defeat in the JP primaries, forcing the former AP commandant to go back to the drawing board.Before the Jubilee primaries, Mbugua was confident he would floor his opponents and clinch the party ticket. &ldquo;I will show them dust in the primaries,&rdquo; he had said in one of his campaign rallies ahead of the nominations.But since his defeat in the nominations, Mbugua has been camping at Jubilee headquarters in Nairobi, seeking to have the results overturned.He has accused his opponent and winner in the primaries, Lee Kinyanjui, of having rigged the polls.Kinyanjui garnered 216,385 against Mbugua&rsquo;s 150,137. Former Nacada chairman John Mututho, who was also seeking the governor ticket, got a paltry 30,487.Analysts say, however, the incumbent lost due to &ldquo;overconfidence&rdquo;.&ldquo;The governor had the resources and machine to convince residents to reelect him, but he squandered the opportunity he had,&rdquo; Nakuru businessman Mark Mutua said.Kinyanjui conducted quiet, but well-calculated campaigns that paled in comparison to his opponent&rsquo;s flashy public meetings usually graced by high-profile musicians.Kinyanjui appeared to have learnt from his 2013 mistakes and in this year&rsquo;s campaigns he concentrated his engagements on rural and far-flung areas and only made occasional appearances in the urban centres.Signs Mbugua&rsquo;s political fortunes were on a downward trend have been evident in the last two years after he was heckled on two occasions when President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto toured the area.The governor&rsquo;s failure to crackdown on allies implicated in financial impropriety and irregular employment, has been cited as one of the mistakes he made. &ldquo;Even when it was clear that some of his allies were involved in shady deals, the governor refused to sack them and he appeared to have been held hostage by the cartels,&rdquo; a former campaigner, who declined to be named, said.Mbugua is expected to vie as an independent if the Jubilee Appeals Tribunal throws out his application challenging the primaries outcome.Another analyst says Mbugua used his staff as chief campaigners, instead of outsourcing. &ldquo;They could not tell him the truth on the ground that the electorate wanted a change of guard,&rdquo; Nakuru political analyst Andrew Nyabuto said.
