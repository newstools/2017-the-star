First Lady Margaret Kenyatta will on Sunday join her counterpart in Rwanda Jeanette Kagame during the Kigali International Peace Marathon that is expected to draw thousands of athletes from across the world, including Kenyans.An estimated 6000 athletes, diplomats and peace enthusiasts from various countries are expected to take part in the annual peace marathon, a national event now in its 13th year running. Although the Kigali event incorporates the 42km full marathon and the 21km races, the two First Ladies are scheduled to run a symbolic and non-competition seven kilometres special &ldquo;run for peace&rdquo; race after flagging off the other two events.The Sunday event marks the second time both First Ladies from Kenya and Rwanda will be running together after the Beyond Zero Half marathon in Nairobi on March 6, last year.
