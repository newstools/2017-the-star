A Nairobi court has said it will not reduce the Sh700,000 bail imposed on IT expert Alex Mutuku.He is accused of electronic fraud which caused the Kenya Revenue Authority a loss of more than Sh3.9 billion.Milimani chief magistrate Francis Andayi declined another request by Mutuku to have the investigating officer in the case be compelled to release some of his items, including a motorbike. Andayi said the court earlier reviewed Mutuku&rsquo;s bail and it was reduced from Sh1 million. He told the accused that the court cannot compel police to release items they might present as exhibit. The magistrate directed that the case proceeds to a full hearing on Wednesday.The prosecution asked the court to order the defence lawyers to collect witness statements themselves from the DCI&rsquo;s office, Nairobi, since the documents are bulky. Mutuku, an IT expert, and eight others have denied fraudulently causing the loss of Sh3.9 billion by interfering with the institution&rsquo;s computer systems.He is jointly charged alongside Embakasi North MP aspirant Joseph Mwangi and Calvin Otieno, Albert Komen, Lucy Wamwandu, David Wambugu, Kenneth Riaga, Omar Ibrahim, James Gakung&rsquo;u and Gilbert Kiptala who are KRA employees.They were detained by the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport Court for 19 days for police to complete investigations.The prosecution alleges that the accused committed the offences between March 1, 2015 and March 1, 2016.Otieno alone faces other charges of being in possession of an AK47 rifle and 24 bullets, without a permit. Komen was charged that on December 13, 2015, at the KRA office in Nairobi, bought for himself a motor vehicle by falsely pretending it was valid from the KRA.Wamwandu is a supervisor at the domestic taxes department at the KRA. She is separately charged with stealing Sh1 billion.Riaga alone faces another charge of abuse of office by altering and falsifying KRA electronic records.Earlier the prosecution told the court Mutuku has the potential to interfere with computer servers remotely, is considered a threat to national security and has been working with suspects who are outside the country.The prosecutors told the court the offence committed by the accused threatens national security and have led to the loss of Sh3 billion in several financial institutions.
