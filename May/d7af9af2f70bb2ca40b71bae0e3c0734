Out of sorts Sony Sugar ended their long winless run at the expense of AFC Leopards in a 1-0 Sporptesa Premier League match win in Awendo yesterday.Coach Salim Babu&rsquo;s men came into the match under interest pressure after a run of poor results that had left them second from bottom. The visit of Ingwe looked to be what could be Babu&rsquo;s last match in charge if results did not go their way but Sony rediscovered themselves to pip the previous title contenders by a last gasp goal from the head of Justin Omari.The win saw Sony move out of the bottom three and into 12th position in the standings table with eleven points, three points behind Leopards at ninth.However, there seems to be no end in sight to Western Stima&rsquo;s woes as they succumbed to yet another defeat, this time at the hands of neighnours Kakamega Homboyz.Eston Esiye scored the lone goal in the 14th to consign Stima to a sixth successive defeat. Stima will feel hard done by as Kennedy Otieno&rsquo;s leveler late in the second half was ruled out.Stima remain bottom with six points after 10 matches while Homeboyz are 11th with 13 points.Thika United missed an opportunity to get out of the relegation zone as they let slip a one goal lead to fall 2-1 away at Nakumatt. Onwudi Chibueze had given Thika the lead but Clinton Kisavuli drew Nakumatt level a result that did not do any good to either side as Thika are second from bottom with seven points with Nakumatt five points better at 11th.Earlier, Thika had rang changes in their technical bench, elevating coach James Nadwa to the position of technical with former international Nicholas Muyoti his replacement.Joseph Ruto is expected to double up as Muyoti&rsquo;s deputy and goalkeeper trainer. Vincent Nyaberi, another ex-player, has been promoted to the position of team manager.&ldquo;Thika is a great club which has produced big names in the football industry in the country. I am ready to work with the current squad to achieve positive results for the remaining bit of the first leg before I decide on whether to make changes or not for the second leg. I have watched the boys play for the shortest time I have been deputizing Nandwa and they are good,&rdquo; said Muyoti.&ldquo;I only intend to change their mentality, attitude and approach for the game. Their mental strength has not worked well in the past and this will be my first assignment.&rdquo;It is a move that will see Thika benefit from an experienced coach who understands the dynamics of the KPL having featured for high profile clubs like AFC Leopards, Thika United, Sofapaka and Karuturi as a player before manning AFC Leopards as a make-shift manager.Muyoti adds international exposure to his name having plied his trade in Uganda&rsquo;s Horizon FC, Indian duo of Churchill Brothers and Sporting Club Degoa and subsequently earning call ups for the national team.
