Yes, the sassy lady once lived in the slums, exposing her to sheng.The humble media personality said she was bullied many times while at Loreto Kiambu High School because of her tomboy personality and for speaking Kiswahili and Sheng.Here's the confession:"If you follow me on Instagram, I posted a picture after the Timaya concert (which I MC&rsquo;d) saying how I used to get bullied when I was younger because I was a tomboy. I spoke a lot of sheng&rsquo; and some people thought I didn&rsquo;t behave how I looked which is actually an insult coming to think of it now. &ldquo;In my first year of High School, I remember people threatening to pour acid on my face, saying I looked like a frog, others saying I am recruiting guys into some demonic stuff&hellip; There was a lot that was said."
