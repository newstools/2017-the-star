Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau has said he will not participate in the repeat Jubilee Party nominations for Murang&rsquo;a governor.This is despite the Political Parties and Disputes Tribunal order that the primaries be conducted within 96 hours from Friday.&ldquo;I am happy that the court vindicated me. However, I will not be part of a repeat nominations because I respect and love the people of Murang&rsquo;a. I do not want to tire them with a repeat exercise while we all know the results will not be any different,&rdquo; Kamau (pictured) said.&ldquo;I will also not be in the ballot in August. What matters is that the people of Murang&rsquo;a know that despite voting for me there was rigging.&rdquo; Kamau claimed he garnered more than 120,000 votes out of 200,000 cast.&ldquo;I am staying put and it should be on record that I won in the Murang&rsquo;a county JP nominations, and what we witnessed being submitted were false figures,&rdquo; he said.Governor Mwangi Wairia was declared the winner during the April 26 polls with 205,976 votes against Kamau&rsquo;s 118,274.This prompted the MP to file an appeal at the tribunal. Kamau cited massive malpractices allowed by presiding officers who had been compromised.The lawmaker said ballot papers marked against his name were found strewn in various places in the county. He said that was a clear indication the papers had been removed from the ballot boxes to ensure they were not counted.On Saturday, the legislator told journalists in Nairobi he believes nothing will change even if the polls are held afresh.The MP further said he will continue to campaign for President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s reelection.&ldquo;The party can freely give the nomination certificate to anyone they wish,&rdquo; he said, adding he will not quit JP.&ldquo;The presidential campaign is what we need to give a bigger push as Jubilee Party members.&rdquo; On Friday, PPDT, led by Kyalo Mbobu, said the primaries were marred by irregularities. &ldquo;The certificate issued to Wairia was null and void. The tribunal consequently orders the party to organise and conduct fresh primaries within 96 hours,&rdquo; read the ruling.The three-member panel further said more than 53, 614 votes were cast in excess of the number of registered voters.
