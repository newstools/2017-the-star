A day after heavy rain, I stopped my vehicle in a forest section and saw thousands of tiny white mushrooms. On closer inspection, I observed that the mushrooms only occurred on an area where termites had made a nest. Termites get their nutrition from cellulose. Cellulose is a very common substance, the basic ingredient of wood and most other plant material. It is found in grass, shrubs and trees. Cellulose is very difficult to digest. Termites in Africa have a different way of digesting cellulose. They raise fungi in a system where they need each other to survive.The African termites, members of the genus Macrotermes, build giant mounds above their nests. The termite workers gather grass, twigs and other wood debris. They chew up the woody material and bring it back to the nest.In the nest, the workers deposit the chewed-up woody material onto a pile called a comb. The termite workers place spores of a special fungus called Termitomyces on the woody material in the comb.The fungus grows on the comb by digesting the cellulose and lignin in the chewed-up wood and grass. The fungi convert the cellulose and lignin into sugars and nitrogen as by-products of digesting woody pulp.The termites eat the sugary material that is left after the fungi have finished digesting the wood, benefitting both the fungi and the termites.Each year, during the rainy season, the fungus gardens inside the termite mounds sprout large mushrooms. People who live near the termite mounds can collect the mushrooms, and they prize them as a delicacy. Yes, they are one of God&rsquo;s many wonders.
