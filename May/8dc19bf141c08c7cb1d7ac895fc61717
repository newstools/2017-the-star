That I can confirm,&rdquo; the source said.Other details remain scant.Political pundits say the element of secrecy and last-minute announcement might take people by surprise, forcing other aspirants back to the drawing board.They add that the idea of choosing a Mijikenda is based on the community&rsquo;s numerical strength. Mijikendas are the single largest vote bloc in Mombasa.They make up 50 per cent of Mombasa voters followed by Kambas, Luos and Luhyas.All other nominees &mdash; Joho (ODM), Suleiman Shahbal (Jubilee Party) and Hezron Awiti (Vibrant Democratic Party) &mdash; have settled on Mijikenda running mates.Joho is expected to unveil his running mate this week.Deputy governor Hazel Katana ditched him on January 28 for President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s JP, citing frustration by ODM and Joho&rsquo;s inner circle.Joho is said to have formed a committee to scout for his next running mate immediately after Katana dumped him.Joho had wished to keep his choice a secret and unveil the running mate as a surprise, but the information was leaked out last week.He has settled on county secretary Francis Thoya.However, other details indicated Joho is still weighing his options between Thoya, Tendai Lewa (Education executive) and Technical University of Mombasa senior lecturer William Kingi.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already decided and will make it known to the public soon. I&rsquo;ll let you know. It&rsquo;ll be a big event,&rdquo; Joho told journalists on Wednesday at the Tamarind Hotel.Awiti has Hassan Mwatoa as his running mate. Shahbal has Annaniah Mwaboza.
