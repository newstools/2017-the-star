A family in Lari on Tuesday exhumed and reburied its matriarch&rsquo;s body to fulfil her dying wish and ward off the misfortunes that have befallen them.Before her death in July last year, Rebecca Mukuhi had directed them not to bury her on the family farm, where she used to fight with her husband Nyaga Thuo.Thuo died on March 28, 2001, and was buried on the farm.The family, however, disregarded Mukuhi&rsquo;s wish and they buried her next to Thuo on July 27, 2016, in Gitithia village. Soon afterward, they started developing strange illnesses. Her eldest son Moses Boro&rsquo;s body hurts terribly and he has difficulty speaking.Daughter Peris Wangui said three members of their family have developed strange illnesses that do not respond to medication.&ldquo;We have taken Boro to various hospitals but even after so many [tests], we have not been told what disease he is suffering from,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;When we noted other two members developing the same condition, we decided to call a family meeting.&ldquo;We remembered that our mother used to tell us not to bury her on the same farm where our father is buried.&rdquo;Wangui said her mother was a born-again Christian but her father was an abusive drunkard.Mukuhi&rsquo;s younger son John Nyago said they called a committee at their home and planned an exhumation.They got an order from the Limuru law courts and arranged for another burial at Gitithia public cemetery. At the cemetery they put the body in a new coffin and burnt the old one. The family was surprised to find the coffin intact, nine months after the burial.&ldquo;We exchanged the coffin at the graveside so that anything from the old one would not fall in our homestead. We hope our brothers will heal,&rdquo; Nyago said.
