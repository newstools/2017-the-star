Unfriendly health workers and over-prescription of painkillers are major issues that make the majority of Kenyans shy away from NHIF&rsquo;s Supa Cover initiative.Director of quality assurance Ambrose Lugho yesterday said since the inception of the initiative last year, most clients have complained of unpleasant historical experiences, such as a poor customer experience, contributing to dropouts.Lugho said some customers lack the money to make immediate payments upon the registration or the necessary documents required to complete the registration. &ldquo;We have also observed a high preference for on-ground registration as opposed to physical office locations,&rdquo; he said. Lugho said though the product awareness is still low, many customers are willing to sign up for Supa Cover once they fully understand the benefits package.Many lapsed members, especially those that had defaulted on NHIF payments for a year, have re-activated their accounts on learning the penalties had been waived, he said.Lugho said many customers do not know the difference between NHIF and other service providers. The Supa Cover Micro Insurance Medical Health Cover targets the low-income population at a cost of Sh6,000 per year.One can pay through monthly instalments of Sh500 and access quality healthcare in more than 6,359 accredited facilities countrywide. Out of these facilities, 80 per cent are government-funded, 17 private and three per cent faith-based, he said. Lugho said since last year they have pulled 370,000 new members on the NHIF cover. Chronic illness, diabetes and hypertension, inpatient cover and maternity are among the 12 packages in Supa Cover.Others are surgical package, renal dialysis, kidney transplant, rehabilitation, drug and substance abuse, oncology, chemotherapy radiotherapy and overseas treatment.&ldquo;So far our membership trend in the NHIF has grown to 6.5 million members, out of whom four million are from the formal sector and two million from the informal sector,&rdquo; he said.Lugho said their revenue growth has grown from Sh9.3 billion in 2014 to Sh29.4 billion by the end of the last financial year. We are looking at a target of Sh33.3 billion by the end of this financial year, out of which 70 per cent of all collections will go to the benefits paid out.
