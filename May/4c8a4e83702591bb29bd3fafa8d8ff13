Deputy President William Ruto is educated yet behaves like an illiterate man, NASA principal Moses Wetang'ula has said. Wetang'ula said Ruto's arguments on Kenya's pertinent issues were not any different from those of a person who has never stepped into a classroom. "I wonder what he was doing in class...was he just planning when his grabbing spree would start?" he said in Kanduyi, Bungoma county, where he met Ford Kenya aspirants who lost the primaries. In November last year, Ruto defended himself against accusations of land grabbing, involvement in extrajudicial killings and the murder of anti-government whistle-blower Jacob Juma.

Not me, says DP Ruto Wetang'ula, who is Bungoma Senator, singled out Ruto's argument on World bank and IMF's advisory on foreign lending, saying his dismissal of the report showed he could not grasp the obvious. He said the country's over-borrowing was risky and that the National Super Alliance will review borrowing when it takes over. “How can a person who went to school rubbish bodies like World Bank and IMF?" he asked, adding corruption by the Jubilee regime "can only be by one illiterate person". Economists at the International Monetary Fund and its sister company, the World Bank, have led a growing chorus for review of the the Banking (Amendment) Act, 2016 since January. The amended law, enforced on September 14, capped loan charges at four percentage points above the prevailing 10 per cent Central Bank Rate and put a floor of 70 per cent of the CBR on interest paid on term deposits. It was meant to help micro- and small-sized enterprises – the drivers of Kenya’s growth – access affordable credit, but has largely been seen as counterproductive. Ruto trashed the recommendations and ruled out a review of the law in the near-term.

"Let him stop telling lies about us because we are going to tell Kenyans lots of truth about them," he said. Others in the Opposition coalition are flag bear Raila Odinga (ODM), DP candidate Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper), Bomet Governor Issac Rutto (CCM) and Musalia Mudavadi (ANC). In October 2016, the DP fought a bid to declare his wealth. Activist Boniface Mwagi had asked the Kenya Revenue Authority and the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission for Ruto's tax returns and wealth declaration forms.

The Ford Kenya boss also said NASA's decision to run a parallel tallying centre was not up for debate because they were not doing anything illegal . Wetang'ula added that Jubilee's opposition to this only shows they are planning to rig the August 8 election. He noted NASA had laid down proper strategies to ensure its 10 million votes are protected.
