Jubilee Party is in a spirited fight to wrest Coast and South Nyanza regions from the Opposition, which is said to have a hold on them.Coast and Kisii leaders dismissed this perception during their meeting with Deputy President William Ruto at his Karen residence in Nairobi on Friday and promised to mobilise residents for support.Ruto, who was with National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale, said he was optimistic about a landslide victory."In 2013, it was difficult to talk about Jubilee in Kisii, Coast and Western but this time round we are doing well as our development track record speaks for itself,&rdquo; he said.He added that Jubilee's primary aim is to creative a conducive environment for Kenyans to realise their full potential, improve lives and transform the country.The DP reiterated that the government has continued to implement its development agenda for Kenyans despite unfair criticism by the Opposition.Ruto said the Opposition's politics of division, diversion and confusion has not distracted them from serving the people.He said it is time Kenyans elected leaders who will put their interests first.Read: Jubilee maps strongholds, battle zonesAlso read: Raila declares vote-hunting war, says Nasa will raid more Jubilee zonesKisii leaders who attended the meeting included Senator Chris Obure, Joel Onyancha (Bomachoge Borabu), Richard Tongi (Nyaribari Chache), Joseph Kiangoi (East Africa Legislative Assembly), Stephen Manoti (Bobasi), Deputy Governor Joash Maangi and former CIC chairman Charles Nyachae. Coast leaders included Governors Salim Mvurya (Kwale), Hussein Dado (Tana River), Dan Mwanzo (Taita Taveta), Harrison Kombe (Magarini), Gideon Mungaro (Kilifi North), Gonzi Rai (Ganze), Naomy Shaban (Taveta), Mustapha Idd (Kilifi South), Fahim Twaha (Lamu East) and Zainab Chidzuga (Kwale).Mvurya said the ruling coalition is more "visible and vibrant&rdquo; in the Coast than it was in 2013. The Opposition got more votes than Jubilee in Coast and Kisii in the last election."The coastal region has embraced Jubilee Party. We will get more votes," he said, a sentiment that Dado echoed.Shaban noted the need for nomination winners to work together with losers for the sake of the party's unity.Obure said the Kisii chose to rally behind Uhuru and Ruto as the Opposition has nothing to show for development while Jubilee is capable of realising economic prosperity in Kenya.&ldquo;We have formed a formidable team that will ensure Jubilee Party wins as many elective seats as possible and votes by the Abagusii community. This will be confirmed on August 8,&rdquo; he said.Maangi and Onyancha dismissed the National Super Alliance as an outfit incapable of winning the next election.&ldquo;Our people have come to terms with the fact that Opposition leaders have nothing to offer the Omogusii. That is why there is a shift to Jubilee Party...it has a vision for all Kenyans,&rdquo; said Onyancha.Maangi said: "The politics of saying we belong to that political outfit yet there is nothing we get in return, especially on matters of development, is long gone."Kiangoi urged aspirants to concentrate on issue-based politics and avoid utterances that may jeopardize national unity.The leaders discouraged tribalistic politics which they accused the Opposition of spearheading.
