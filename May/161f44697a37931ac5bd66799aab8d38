Two Jubilee Budalang&rsquo;i MP aspirants claim the party issued them certificates.Mediatrice Wangira, who was declared the winner during the party nominations and issued a certificate, celebrated her victory on Saturday under heavy security to avoid possible confrontation with her rival&rsquo;s supporters.Her opponent, Alfred Maloba, who claimed to have been issued a certificate by the National Elections Board, also toured the constituency&rsquo;s four wards, thanking residents for supporting him.At one point, Maloba&rsquo;s supporters stopped at the gate of their opponent and began hurling insults, but were forced to flee when Wangira&rsquo;s supporters threatened to beat them.Speaking to the Star at Ruambwa Junction during her meet-the people tour, Wangira said she won the nomination &ldquo;in broad daylight&rdquo; and was issued the nomination certificate.She said her opponent got a parallel nomination certificate through the back door.&ldquo;My opponent has refused to accept defeat, yet I floored him in the nominations by a landslide. I am not worried at all, because the certificate I have is legal and fully recognised by the party,&rdquo; Wangira said.
