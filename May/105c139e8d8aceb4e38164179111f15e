Kwale woman representative aspirant Fatuma Tabwara has denied claims by incumbent Zainab Chidzuga she is being sponsored by senior Jubilee officials.Tabwara described Chidzuga as a &ldquo;coward who has sensed defeat because of her poor development record&rdquo;.On Monday, she said, &ldquo;Despite promising to deliver, she has done nothing. She has not engaged women in projects to boost their living standards.&rdquo;Tabwara, the former county service board vice chairperson, said Chidzuga should tell voters what she has done since 2013 &ldquo;instead of spreading propaganda about other aspirants&rdquo;.She described herself as a visionary leader focussed on development.&ldquo;I am not anyone&rsquo;s project. I am vying because of my passion and desire to help fellow women in the county. Chidzuga should be ready to face other opponents at the ballot,&rdquo; Tabwara said.
