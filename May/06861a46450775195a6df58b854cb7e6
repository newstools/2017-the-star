Migori Governor Okoth Obado’s security guard was found alive on Friday, 48 hours after he was reported kidnapped in Nairobi. The AP officer was reported missing at Muthangari police station on Wednesday night. The officer went missing after dropping his boss at his Lavington home at 10pm. He was last seen leaving an entertainment venue in Kangemi in the company of two women shortly after 11pm, police said. Kabete police chief Rashid Mohammed confirmed that the officer had been traced to Githurai 45 and rescued. He, however, declined to further comment on other findings. Police sources said the officer, who was unarmed at the time, may have been drugged by the two women. They drove in a taxi to Kayole where they stole the officers’ mobile phone and cash after which they dumped him in Githurai 45. The officer’s mobile phone was used to call friends and relatives to demand ransom for his release. By Thursday evening, DCI officers from Kabete had yet to trace the phone and other stolen items.
