The waiver on visa fees for tourists below age of 16 has particularly boosted arrivals from India, the Kenya Tourism Board has said. &ldquo;Indians do like travelling as families and the visa incentive is paying off. This market has rose from below 10 best performing tourist source market to position three after US and UK in that order,&rdquo; KTB chief executive Betty Radier (pictured) said. Official data shows visitors from India increased by about third in 2016 to 64,116 from 49,756 in 2015, a growth of 28.9 per cent. The arrivals have also been boosted by reduction in park entry fee, she added.While launching a marketing and promotional partnership campaign between KTB and one of the India&rsquo;s cricket team, Rising Pune Super, Radier said in a statement on Tuesday the target for arrivals from Asia&rsquo;s second largest economy was about 100,000 by next year. &ldquo;This market has all the potential to be the top tourist source market to Kenya and that explains our marketing strategies such as leveraging on cricket sport which is the most popular to the Indian community,&rdquo; Radier said. KTB has allocated about Sh25 million for the destination marketing and promotional campaigns through the cricket sport, and hopes to benefit from its global broadcast in more than 15 countries in the ongoing league series. &ldquo;We also expect to engage with approximately five million consumers through the social media engagements where Indian fans can win a holiday trips to Kenya&rdquo; she added. Kenya&rsquo;s deputy High Commissioner to India Bellinda Omino hailed the uptake of electronic visa application system.
