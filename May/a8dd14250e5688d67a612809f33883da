Word Is caught up with this socialite, Pendo, who explained that she never paid for the dildo because she was travelling."I didn't pay for the dildo because I could not send M-Pesa on air. I was on the plane, by the time I landed, the chick had already decided to tell the world that Pendo owes her money."When asked if she was still going to pay up, Pendo said:"I'm not paying even a dime. I'm sure people didn't know she sells vibrators and dildos and now she is making money from my branding. But she saw the best way is to put my photo and phone number on social media."Pendo added: "If we go to court, I will not pay anything because of defamation of character. Business is not handled that way. In fact, she is the one supposed to pay me. I'm not going to sue her, si ametengeneza business yake. Atafutemtumwingine basi."Pendo finished by saying she is not going to change her number and is going to pick all the calls she will be getting, after her number was posted online for non-payment of the sex toy.
