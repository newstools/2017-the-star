Lamu woman rep Shakila Abdalla and civil society organisation members have urged Unesco to intervene to stop the establishment of a Sh200 billion coal-fired power plant in the county. In 2001, Unesco listed Lamu Old Town as a World Heritage Site in recognition of its unique cultural value. Speaking in Lamu yesterday, Abdalla and the activists said the Amu Power project will hurt the ecosystem, irreversibly change the community’s way of life and ruin their irreplaceable heritage. “The project will do a lot of damage, not just to our health and environment but also to the culture and heritage of this place. If this happens, Lamu will be banished from being a world heritage site,” Abdalla said.
