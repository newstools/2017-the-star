A scientist from Murang&rsquo;a county has urged the government to commercialise water hyacinth and allow researchers to find permanent solutions for its eradication.Simon Mwaura, the CEO of Hyaquip Company, on Tuesday said this will ensure the aquatic weed provides an opportunity for researchers to develop new products and stop its spread.He has produced 15 products from hyacinth, including high-nutrient organic fertiliser and animal feeds.Mwaura said the energy plant established in Homa Bay by a British company, Equinox, is not economically viable and will not eradicate the weed.The 35-megawatt plant is constructed in partnership with the government for Sh26 billion. Mwaura said it will neither give value for money nor improve residents&rsquo; lives.He uses a process known as organic synthesis to change a chemical from hyacinth to stop its seeds from sprouting and multiplying. The biochemist addressed journalists in Murang&rsquo;a town.He said the seeds have a lifespan of 25 years, but only takes 15 days to mature, hence, the problem.
