When I regain consciousness, I am back on the mattress. There is a huge jug of water and a plastic cup. I can finally drink to my fill. The trunk is at the corner, probably as a reminder of what will happen to me if I don&rsquo;t &ldquo;behave&rdquo;. Why lie? That&rsquo;s not something I want to experience again. I feel groggy but mostly very thirsty. I gulp down the water. Patches of memory slowly return. My grand escape fail. How I wailed until I passed out from the heat. I didn&rsquo;t wake up when they finally opened the trunk. I don&rsquo;t even remember being lifted out and being placed on this mattress. Bill comes into the room. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re awake! Good,&rdquo; he says. He sits on the trunk, facing me. &ldquo;Are you holding me for ransom?&rdquo; I ask. Better to be blunt and know what I&rsquo;m facing. He gives me a long, measured gaze. &ldquo;They said you were smart,&rdquo; he responds.&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s it?&rdquo; I ask, my worst fear coming to be. &ldquo;My family has no money. I support my mother!&rdquo;&ldquo;If this is true, then surely we must know it too,&rdquo; Bill says. He stands up and faces me, arms akimbo. &ldquo;They said you were smart&hellip;&rdquo; he says again, looking disappointed.I gulp down more water. If they don&rsquo;t want ransom, then what is this?&ldquo;What have you been up to Samantha? Who have you pissed off?&rdquo; he asks sardonically. &ldquo;You must be aware of cause and effect.&rdquo; I stop drinking and wipe the excess fluid from my mouth. Who have I pissed off? Where do I start? The VIP. The Prude. GG. Wait. Could any of them be behind this?&ldquo;I have a lot of money. I&rsquo;ll pay you double what they are giving you,&rdquo; I say. &ldquo;Just let me go.&rdquo;&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t answer me,&rdquo; Bill says.&ldquo;Answer you regarding what?&rdquo; I ask. &ldquo;Whom I may have upset?&rdquo;&ldquo;Cause and effect,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Causality is a genetic connection of phenomena through which one thing under certain conditions gives rise to something else,&rdquo; I reply dryly. &ldquo;So you are a smart girl,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;And since you&rsquo;re so clever, what would be the effect of me screwing over the people who brought you here for whatever money you may give me?&rdquo;I don&rsquo;t immediately respond. My mind is racing. He is afraid of whoever brought me here. Not good. He is not the boss. Not good. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re smart, too,&rdquo; I finally say. &ldquo;One doesn&rsquo;t normally discuss science with kidnappers.&rdquo;&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; he asks. &ldquo;Do you get kidnapped often?&rdquo;Touch&eacute;. Who is this guy? &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just saying that a person with philosophical leanings may have picked a different path, as far as careers are concerned.&rdquo;&ldquo;I had options,&rdquo; he says with a smile. &ldquo;But this is kind of fun. No?&rdquo; A sadist, too. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you just spell it out for me?&rdquo; I say. &ldquo;Take off your clothes,&rdquo; he says abruptly.&ldquo;What?&rdquo; I ask.&ldquo;You want to know why you are here? Take off your clothes,&rdquo; he says.&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I say, the feeling of cold dread returning.&ldquo;Take off your clothes, right now or spend the night in the trunk. It&rsquo;s up to you,&rdquo; he says calmly. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I say again. He walks towards me, seemingly unfazed by my refusal.&ldquo;Causality is a genetic connection of phenomena through which one thing under certain conditions gives rise to something else,&rdquo; he says. repeating what I had said earlier word for word. I hold my breath.
