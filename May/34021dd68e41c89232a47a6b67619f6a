The KTN News anchor, who is currently on holiday, has spoken up about the post. The post put up by a profile page, Betty Mutei Kyalo, reads, “Finally, Hhe proposed and I gladly said ‘Yes’. Thanks to my forever love of my Life! #FreshStart!” She reacted with shock when Word Is congratulated her on the good news. “Engagement?” Betty asked. After seeing the screenshot she retorted, “That’s a fake page. That has many followers.” She clarified that she has two Facebook pages, one a private profile page and an official page. The profile photos on both show her dressed in blue. In jest, Betty said by now the post, which has since gone viral, has seen the blogosphere pick wedding suppliers, invited guests and all she has to do is “just appear on that day with a guy.” Here are some reactions from Kenyans online. Michael Kabuthia: Betty, seriously! Mpaka nimeenda kwa Neiba kuomba password ya Wi-Fi nikifikiria Safcom wametuchesa Kama ile Siku mnaija alipoteza network from remand ya inda!!! Good one though. Justine Motari: No sin is too big to forgive if someone is remorseful. Hope to see you and Dennis back together someday. Probably Dennis tripped but “sh*t happens”. Gody Smillow: Thanks ma love you made my day. I promise to love you forever and I’ll keep ma word just like our love is intact. Thanks for accepting my proposal it’s the best thing that I will forever celebrate. The same way you gladly said yes, I will gladly take good care of you my princess. Sam Mwaimet Mohamud: Betty you behave like a teenager for real, I thought you are over 25yrs. People of your age now are so serious with their life and that of their children’s future. Tulia kwa hii dunia, you are now a mother and real mother’s have no time ya ujinga.
