World half marathon record holder Joyciline Jepkosgei has set her on the Augusts&rsquo; IAAF World Championships in London.Fresh from smashing Gifu Half Marathon course record two weeks ago, Jepkosgei is now preparing for the Kenya Defence Forces championships set for next week as the battle for slots in Team Kenya to the Worlds start.Jepkosgei who erased Peris Chepchirchir&rsquo;s world mark barely a week after it was set said she will be searching for a ticket in the 10,000m team.&ldquo;Currently, I am enjoying my good form. My intention this season is to try my luck in track for the world championships and I will compete next week during the KDF championships,&rdquo; Jepkosgei said. &ldquo;I have been to Team Kenya for international competition once and I did well. This time my focus is to first qualify and then seek better performance in London,&rdquo; said the KDF officer who trains in Iten under husband-cum-coach Nicholas Koech.She will be facing former Chicago marathon winner Gladys Cherono in the 10,000m event including other Kenya&rsquo;s elite athletes who will be hunting for the all-important qualification at the KDF show.&ldquo;The competition will be tough. As you know, we have elite athletes but I will be defending the title for my brigade,&rdquo; said the Africa 10,000m bronze medallist.At the Gifu Half Marathon last month, Jepkosgei clocked 67:44 minutes to smash the 68:55 mark previously held by Kenya-born Bahraini Eunice Kirwa.She also set the new world half marathon record at this year&rsquo;s Prague Half Marathon in Czech Republic, smashing 14 seconds off from the previous record set by compatriot Chepchirchir in February 10 at the RAK Half Marathon.En route to her stunning victory, she also set other three world records crossing the 10km mark in 30:05 beating the 30:21 set by Paula Radcliffe in 2013.She also passed the 15km in 45:37 to surpass the 46:14 set by the former world record holder Florence Kiplagat in 2015 and set the 20km record in 61:25.&ldquo;When I was heading to RAK Half Marathon in February, my target was to set a world record but something happened and I couldn&rsquo;t but I am happy that I was able to make it in Prague,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;At Gifu, the course was hard but I tried for the record. I am praying God to enable me make it to the world championships,&rdquo; she added.
