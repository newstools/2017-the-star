Today evening, two-time Grammy award-winning reggae and dancehall artiste Damian Marley is set jet into Nairobi, where he will be performing live at the Street Fusion 2017. For the first time ever in East Africa, Damian is set to perform on Wednesday at the Carnivore Grounds in Nairobi. The concert will also feature local artists Wyre, Jua Cali, Khaligraph Jones and leading DJs. One of the organisers told Word Is that besides his performance, "Damian is expected to surprise his fans at a city reggae club, as well as visit the Nairobi Animal Orphanage in hopes of adopting a lion, the Rastafarian depiction of King Selassie; conquering lion of the tribe of Judah." He is a musician and vocal advocate of social and controversial issues like education and legalisation of marijuana.
