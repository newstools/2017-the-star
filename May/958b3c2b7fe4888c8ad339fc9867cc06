Trans Nzoia has the highest number of independent candidates among North Rift counties.More than 100 independent candidates have been cleared to vie in Trans Nzoia. Three are going for governor slot, two for Senate, more than 15 for MP and scores for MCA.Some wards will have more than three aspirants running as independents.Most candidates say they decided to go independent because of failed or flawed nominations in Ford Kenya and Jubilee, the main parties in the region. &ldquo;The high number of independents results from either poor organisation or lack of nominations,&rdquo; Ken Wafula, independent running for the Senate said.Some parties simply handed the nomination certificates to preferred aspirants. Three independent candidates for governor who ditched Ford Kenya are teaming up to back one of them against Governor Patrick Khaemba, who got a direct ticket. The three said they were denied the chance to face Khaemba for the nomination.
