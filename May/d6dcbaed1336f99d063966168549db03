Niger President
Mahamadou Issoufou called on the leaders of the Group of Seven
nations to take urgent measures to end the Libyan crisis and
derided them for not keeping to aid promises to fight poverty in
West Africa's poorest regions. Niger, which adjoins Libya to the south and has fought
Islamists at home, is increasingly concerned about the situation
in the North Africa country where rival governments oppose each
other leaving a power vacuum that has enabled Islamist groups to
establish a foothold in the country. "The fight against terrorism in the Sahel countries and the
Lale Chad demands that urgent measures be taken to put out the
Libyan cauldron," Issoufou, one of several Africa leaders
attending a G7 summit in Sicily, said in a speech The former French colony remains one of the poorest
countries on earth. More than 60 per cent of its 17 million
people survive on less than $1 a day and as a result it is also
one of the main transit points for African migrants seeking to
reach Europe through Libya. "Be it Niger, a transit nation, or the countries of origin,
it is only through development that we will prevent illegal
migration," Issoufou said. French President Emmanuel Macron, whose country has more
than 4,000 troops spanning across West Africa as part of a
counter-terrorism operation, said on Friday that more needed to
be done to support the development of countries like Niger as
well as providing military assistance. Issoufou on Saturday also took a swipe at the leaders of
Germany, France, Italy, Japan, Canada, Britain and the United
States, saying they had simply not lived up to their promises. "In terms of development aid, rare are the donor countries
that meet the level of 0.7 per cent of GDP promised 50 years ago
and the G8 promised in 2005 25 billion euros in extra
development. That target promise was never met," Issoufou said. Italy had hoped to make Africa the major focus of the annual
G7 gathering, holding the discussions on the island of Sicily
that has taken in hundreds of thousands of migrants over the
past four years as they flee war and poverty back home. However, the two-day meeting got overshadowed by a suicide
bombing in northern England on Monday that killed 22 people, and
also got bogged down by lengthy discussions on the merit of free
trade and the 2015 Paris Agreement to tackle climate change.
