Kenyans have been assured the imported maize from Mexico is not genetically modified. National Biosafety Authority chief executive, Willy Tonui, on Friday said testing of 30,000 metric tonnes of imported maize was done in March before it arrived in the country two weeks ago.He said the results shows the maize is 99.9 per cent non-GM, which meets the European Union standards.&ldquo;It is, however, difficult to get maize that is 100 per cent non-GM because most of the countries in the world that export maize in large scale are also producing GM food. This means that you are likely to have some low levels of GM because there could be mixing of GM and non-GM crops during processing and transportation of the commodity,&rdquo; Tonui said.He was speaking during an agricultural biotechnology sensitisation workshop with faith based organisations in Nairobi. Tonui said although Kenya has stringent laws on GMOs, the country has an allowance of 0.9 per cent GM levels to address the maize shortage and the ongoing drought.&ldquo;But anything above one per cent is considered as GM and must therefore be labelled,&rdquo; he said.Millers that have so far imported maize include Kitui Flour Mills and Pembe Flour Mills. Each shipped in 10,000 metric tonnes, and Hydrey (P) Limited imported 9,900 metric tonnes. The firms were required to seek an approval from the NBA before importing. The approval is given or denied within seven days. Millers that get the go-ahead are then issued with a Phytosanitary Import Permit by the Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Services. Tonui said millers who would want to import maize can apply online on the NBA&rsquo;s website by July 31.
