Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka was on Saturday booed by Migwani residents when he said he did not meddle in the Kitui governor nominations on April 24.&ldquo;I am an honest and transparent person. I am stating clearly that I wasn&rsquo;t involved,&rdquo; Kalonzo (pictured) said.He spoke during Alice Musila&rsquo;s burial, the mother of Kitui Senator David Musila.The Wiper leader distanced himself from the alleged rigging.Musila and his supporters have been claiming he helped Kitui Governor Julius Malombe rig Musila out yet he won in the primaries. The governor had not attended the burial because he was in another function. He has, however, denied rigging claims.Kalonzo said there is nothing that can separate him from Musila since they have a long history. He said after Musila resigned as Wiper chairman and ditched the party, he has not approved his resignation and will not do it.&ldquo; Musila said he will vie as an independent candidate, but I will just wait and see. If he wins in the governor race, well and good, but if he doesn&rsquo;t, then he will have to come back and assume his position as Wiper party chairman,&rdquo; Kalonzo said.Former politician Nyiva Mwendwa, who quit active politics, urged Musila and Senator Johnson Muthama to go back to Wiper because they are the party&rsquo;s strongest pillars. Mwendwa said as a pioneer of Wiper, she will not sit and watch the house crumble.NASA co-principal Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula said Musila still supports NASA. He said NASA is determined to win the presidential seat.
