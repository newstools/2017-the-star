Kenya Airways has appointed Polish national Sebastian Mikosz as the new managing director and CEO taking over from Mbuvi Ngunze. In a statement on Thursday, the national carrier's chairman Michael Joseph said the appointment will take effect on June 1. Mikosz, who previously served as Polish Airlines CEO, has more than 20 years experience in executive management in both public and private sector. "He was the CEO of esKy.pl, a leading central European online travel agency and LOT Polish Airlines,"Joseph said. He congratulated the new appointee and promised the crew's support. "We wish him every success as he assumes his new responsibility. We have no doubt that with support we will strive to greater heights." Mikosz's appointment ends months of the global search for the airline's CEO in a recruitment process by international firm Spencer Stuart. Ngunze headed the troubled airline for the past two years and was due for retirement in March. The outgoing CEO resigned in November last year amid pressure for him to leave. The calls intensified after the airline encountered hitches that forced the delay of flights. The union accused Ngunze and his team of being unable to get the airline out of its financial woes. Management changes saw former chairman Dennis Awori resign prior to the airline's half-year performance update and Joseph appointed to replace him late in October.
