The Kenya Wildlife Service security team in Meru National Park has recovered six elephant tusks and identified three suspected poachers.KWS, in a statement yesterday, said the rangers made headway after employing a new strategy of working with elders from local communities in the fight against poaching.The suspected poachers are believed to have recently killed two elephants, whose carcases were discovered in the precincts of Bisanadi National Reserve.The suspects have been in hiding since the start of the KWS and local community meetings for fear of the reprisals. &ldquo;The elders have promised to arrest and hand over the suspects to KWS when they resurface,&rdquo; the agency said.A series of meetings between KWS and the local community are scheduled in coming days to address a number of wildlife security related problems. On May 13, the KWS security operations team in Meru National Park, while on routine wildlife patrols at Magado near Bisanadi National Reserve, received information that two elephant carcases had been spotted by herdsmen.
