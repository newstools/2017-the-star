Deputy President William Ruto on Tuesday said Jubilee continues to command a huge following in the Rift Valley, despite some individuals fighting hard to split the votes.Ruto said all elected leaders from the region, save for Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto and Baringo Senator Gideon Moi, support him and President Uhuru Kenyatta. There is no cause for worries that the region is no longer in Jubilee, he said.The DP added, &ldquo;I do not feel isolated, and if it is the question of isolation it is only some few leaders who are isolating themselves. Out of the 50 MPs we have in the region, only one does not support us, and out of 15 governors, only one.&rdquo;He said on August 8, Jubilee will win the votes with a bigger margin, compared to the last general election since they are even more prepared to face NASA.Ruto said the assumption by NASA principals that they will win the election by 10 million votes was &ldquo;just stories&rdquo;, compared to Jubilee&rsquo;s grip. &ldquo;If they have lost votes in the Coast, Western and in Kisii while we are the same time gaining more in those areas, how can that be possible?&rdquo; he said during an interview at a local TV station. He said all aspirants running on Jubilee tickets during the recently concluded primaries but lost and opted to run as independent candidates are free to support Jubilee.
