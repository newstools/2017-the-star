Aulian clan Sultan Hamud Mohamed has expressed concern about the resurgence of al Shabaab militants targetting security officers in Garissa and Mandera counties. Seventeen people have been killed in two weeks.Addressing the press in Garissa town on Saturday, he said there had been a lull in the past year.Mohamed said residents are living in fear, and the attacks have brought back horrifying memories of the Garissa University College massacre that claimed 147 lives, most of them students.He said security agents should go back to the drawing board and retrace their steps to find out what went wrong.Mohamed said that although it is the government&rsquo;s duty to guarantee the security of its citizens, residents must also do their part and volunteer information that will lead to arrests.&ldquo;In the past two weeks, reports of our police officers being killed by IEDs attributed to al Shabaab have shocked us. We as Garissa leaders condemn these killings. These are our sons. Leaders are not talking about it,&rdquo; he said. Mohamed said leaders will not sit back and watch as security personnel are killed and property is destroyed.
