World 1,500m silver medallist, Elijah Manangoi is seeking to break the three-and a half lap race world record of 3:26.00 set by Hicham El Guerrouj 19 years ago in Rome. Manangoi starts the IAAF Samsung Diamond League season tonight at Suheim bin Hamad stadium in Doha, Qatar where he is targeting to lower the course record, according to his coach Bernard Ouma.&ldquo;In Doha, Qatar, Manangoi and Timothy Cheruiyot will attempt the course record. They will be in Eugene, Oregon on May 27,&rdquo; Ouma said. Kenya&rsquo;s Asbel Kiprop, the reigning world champion holds the meet record with his 3:29.18 victory in 2014. Kiprop, also a three-time world champion, will not be seeking the fourth victory in Doha after withdrawing from the event.His compatriots are expected to provide the stiffest competition, namely Silas Kiplagat, the 2011 world silver medallist.Ayanleh Souleiman of Djibouti, the 2014 world indoor champion, could also be a factor. He has raced well in Doha before, beating a stacked field in the 800m two years ago.Ouma said Manangoi will go for El Guerrouj&rsquo;s record in Monaco on July 15. &ldquo;He has fully recovered from the injury he suffered in Rio. He is in good shape and I&rsquo;m confident he will break the record in Monaco,&rdquo; said Ouma.
