Likoni residents last Friday forced Deputy President William Ruto to address the maize crisis issue that has rocked the country for the past few weeks. Ruto, who was addressing residents at Caltex grounds, was forced to divert the maize issue as he talked about projects that have been undertaken by the Jubilee government at the Coast.He however said the unga crisis claims are not genuine. Ruto blamed governors for the maize crisis in the country, saying agriculture is a devolved function.&ldquo;Hatutaki watu wasema unga kumbe ni ile unga ingine,&rdquo; he said. (&ldquo;we do not want to hear people complaining about unga, and it is another type of flour they are talking about.&rdquo;) Ruto said the drug business at the Coast will not thrive. &ldquo;Mambo ya hio unga ingine haina nafasi Kenya hii. Wale matapeli wanadhani watauza unga kwa vijana wetu, chuma chao kimotoni.&rdquo; Loosely translated, this means &ldquo;The drug business does not have a place in Kenya. Those who think they can sell drugs to youths, their days are numbered.&rdquo;
