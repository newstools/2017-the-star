National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale yesterday urged the Commission for University Education to award charters to two Islamic university colleges so they become fully fledged.He said in Garissa yesterday the government should initiate the process of granting charters to the institutions because they play a critical role in imparting knowledge to Muslims.Duale said this will save students graduating from Islamic madrassas the expenses of flying to Sudan, Saudi Arabia, or any other country to seek university education.&ldquo;We want Umma and RAF Universities to be given charters so all the Muslim students can go to these two universities because it&rsquo;s less expensive for their parents and will create employment for our people,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Islamic institutions are coming up with the right curriculum and proper teaching of Islam. For this is reason, the commission should think of awarding charters.&rdquo;Sheikh Hussein Mahat, a respected Muslim cleric in Garissa town, welcomed the call, saying it has come at the right time when many Muslim parents prefer to take their children to Islamic colleges.Mahat, who once sat in the council of an Islamic college in Kenya, said the process and conditions set by CUE do not favour Islamic institutions.&ldquo;Most of our Islamic colleges offer secular education. The commission seems not to recognise this system. For us, this system forms part of our teaching and faith,&rdquo; he said.Mahat urged the commission to relax some conditions to ensure all institutions can apply and be granted the charters.&ldquo;Education is key to prosperity. Institutions should not feel discriminated against because of faith.&rdquo;
