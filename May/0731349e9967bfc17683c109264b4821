Charles E Silberman, in his The Open Classroom Reader, says ability to read puts the cumulative experience of humankind at the disposal of each person.The curriculum reform initiative piloted in 470 primary schools has the potential to radically change Kenya&rsquo;s educational landscape.The initiative reviews the role reading, writing and arithmetic will play in realising the ambitious but crucial educational outcomes inherent in the reform process.The ambitious curriculum goals that the government wants achieved will require learners to acquire fluency, literacy and numeracy skills&mdash;the ability to read, write and cipher&mdash;classical skills that have defined the basis of great education systems.The overriding goal of the curriculum is to Identify and nurture the potential of every learner&mdash;throughout all the phases of education.Secondly, it has also provided room for a differentiated curriculum. It accordingly provides room for academic, technical and talent pathways. Every learner will henceforth pursue a career path according to his abilities and interests.Thirdly, the curriculum aims at deliberately promoting what in educational jargon is called High Order Thinking Skills, which are particularly important in the global and information-based economy.To cope in this world, students ought to have the capacity to think deeply about issues, solve problems creatively, work in teams, communicate clearly, and learn to deal with a flood of information in their environment.The Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development has recommended a Competency Based Curriculum. This is defined as &ldquo;the ability to apply appropriate knowledge and skills to successfully perform a function.&rdquo;The KICD has identified competencies the government wants developed and subsequently applied by learners at basic education levels. These are communication and collaboration, self-efficacy, critical thinking and problem solving, creativity and imagination, citizenship, digital literacy, and learning to learnFinally, yet importantly, the curriculum has embedded national values, drawn from the Constitution and established religions, values stakeholders want imparted to the learners. The policymakers want not only to develop learners to cope with the dynamics of the job market; they want them to grow into responsible citizens who can help build political institutions.Reading is the foundation of all learning. Some countries, such as South Africa, Tanzania, Rwanda, and Uganda, have made reading a national priority. Singapore takes reading and mastery of the English language, in general, so seriously that it has a national competition on fluency and simplicity in speaking English&mdash;the basic language of instruction in the school system.The Ministry of Education appreciates this fact and is one: Implementing an innovative Early Grade Literacy Programme aimed at improving literacy standards in lower primary.The Tusome Programme aims at improving the teaching and learning of English and Kiswahili for 5.4 million Kenyan children in std one and two so they acquire the ability to read and write by the time they join standard 3.The thinking is that once children learn how to read, they are likely to expand their minds by reading age appropriate materials as they go along.Second is the drastic reduction of the curriculum load at lower primary levels to provide more leeway to teach literacy.A curriculum is nothing but the total structure of knowledge, skills, and educational experiences that make up any one educational system or its component parts.Reading is the medium through which knowledgeable and skilled people share their knowledge, beliefs, and thinking habits. In the process of reading, one develops knowledge and, correspondingly, a critical mind about issues.
