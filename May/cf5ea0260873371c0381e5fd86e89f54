Third-way Alliance Kenya Wajir governor candidate Salah Abdi has chosen his running mate.He spoke to the press in Wajir town on Sunday. Abdi said he chose Siyat Ore, a teacher with a masters degree in Education. He hails from Wajir West. Ore has also been a youth leader.&ldquo;At the start of my search for a running mate, I attempted to secure the slot for a woman, but most of the ones we approached were not ready to engage in politics,&rdquo; said Abdi, an accountant and auditor.He declared his interest in the governor&rsquo;s seat in January 2016. Abdi went to Starehe Boys Centre before proceeding to the University of Nairobi where he graduated with a Bachelor of Commerce degree.His agenda is to advance issue-based politics as an alternative to the clan-based negotiated democracy, where elders choose and endorse those to vie for political office. &ldquo;Clan-based politics has not helped us, and anything that doesn&rsquo;t work should be done away with,&rdquo; Abdi said. &ldquo;I want the te to hold me accountable, not because I am a member of their clan, or that their clan voted for me, but because I either delivered or failed.&rdquo;Abdi said unlike other political aspirants, he will not seek the approval of clan elders to secure his political ambitions. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want people to get me wrong, I respect my elders and clansmen very much, but my approach is issue-based rather than clan-based negotiated democracy,&rdquo; he said. Abdi has identified women and youth groups whom he intends to work with.
