Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli yesterday declared that the August 8 presidential election will be a two-horse race, pitting President Uhuru Kenyatta against NASA chief Raila Odinga.He spoke in Uhuru Park during the Labour Day celebrations.&ldquo;This time round we have two horses. If you see a third contestant be sure that is a donkey,&rdquo;Atwoli said to a thunderous applause from the crowd.The trade unionist said, however, Cotu has no preferred presidential candidate.&ldquo;We want to see first what is in the manifestos of political parties. We don&rsquo;t take a position without a decision by the governing council. When we make that, we will inform you and Raila,&rdquo; he told Uhuru. &ldquo;Nobody should say we are working with NASA or Jubilee.&rdquo; Atwoli told Uhuru to prioritise the Konza city dream to create jobs for millions of unemployed young people.&ldquo;You and your deputy are young people. Make sure this is achieved,&rdquo; he said.Atwoli warned Kenyans against accepting any job in foreign countries, saying many successful applicants end up suffering. He accused &ldquo;rogue employment agencies&rdquo; of getting their money upfront and never caring about the welfare of domestic workers abroad.&ldquo;Even if we are poor, let&rsquo;s stay with our daughters and sisters. We should not export modern slavery. Most of our young girls are coming back in coffins,&rdquo; Atwoli said. He warned that unions will push for the disbandment of the Collective Bargaining Agreement Advisory Centre because it is not backed by law.
