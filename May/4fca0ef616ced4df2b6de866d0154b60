Kwale senator aspirant Nicholas Zani wants ODM to disqualify his competitor Issah Boy for joining the race for the ticket past the deadline. Boy floored Zani in the April 22 primaries garnering 15,307 votes against the latter's 4,382. Zani petitioned ODM's appeal tribunal citing irregularities and lack of fairness in the exercise. "Boy would not have been an aspirant in the first place because he applied past the February 12 deadline," he said. He also claimed Issah, who is the late Senator Juma Boy's brother, never paid his application fee. "He fraudulently used his late brother's fees without letters of administration. This is criminal. Issah said the party leadership approved the illegality," he added. Zani asked the ODM election board to clarify who committed the fraud as Boy did not qualify to be an aspirant. But Boy dismissed the claims, terming Zani a perennial loser. "History is repeating itself because my late brother beat Zani in the Senate race (in 2013) by over 15,000 votes while he (Zani) only got about 4,000," the ODM nominee said. Boy said Zani should take the matter to the party election board instead of the media. "I beat him by a big margin because Kwale people spoke loudly and voted for me. I was cleared by ODM like he was. We all went for nomination and I got the ticket," he added. Read: Juma Boy family picks Issah as heir in Senate
