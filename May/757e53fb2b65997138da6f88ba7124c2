Kajuju garnered 131,349 votes against Mwangaza&rsquo;s 119,246. But Mwangaza said she was rigged out. Munya said he sensed the primaries would be unfair.&ldquo;We saw it coming and that is why we decamped as we knew the party primaries would be unfair,&rdquo; he said.The Meru governor said Mwangaza has learnt her lesson the hard way.He spoke at Kianjai,Tigania West, on Monday. The governor said had Mwangaza stuck with PNU she would have easily trounced Kajuju.Munya had urged Mwangaza to run for the woman representative post on the PNU ticket. He told county Water executive Mary Mwiti to step down from the race for Mwangaza. After Mwangaza&rsquo;s exit, Munya replaced her with Elizabeth Kailemia. The governor is supporting Kailemia&rsquo;s bid and even introduces her during rallies. She was in Jubilee before decamping to PNU ahead of the primaries.Mwangaza owns the Baite TV station. She appeared to be remorseful for dumping Jubilee. Political analysts say Mwangaza had a lot of support due to her affiliation to the Meru governor, which she lost when she moved to JP.
