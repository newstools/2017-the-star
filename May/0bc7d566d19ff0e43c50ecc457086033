Meru Senator Kiraitu Murungi should keep off PNU affairs and stop using propaganda to win voters&rsquo; support, Tigania West MP David Karithi has said.He disputed Kiraitu&rsquo;s claims that PNU is not backing President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s reelection.&ldquo;PNU conducted a national delegates&rsquo; conference and endorsed President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s reelection bid so he should stop lying to the people of Meru that we are not supporting the President,&rdquo; Karithi said.He said Kiraitu should stop acting like the party spokesperson as he is not.&ldquo;We know he has been fighting PNU. He even wanted the party deregistered. The recent claims about NASA are a ploy to malign the party and try to get some sympathy votes, but we are telling him we will trounce Jubilee in Meru,&rdquo; Karithi said.The PNU legislator is the only elected MP in Meru county supporting Governor Peter Munya&rsquo;s reelection.On Sunday, Murungi said Munya is supporting NASA activities in Meru and had even recently sponsored NASA meetings in the county.&ldquo;We know Munya is in NASA. He and ward administrators organised the [NASA] meeting at Maili Tatu. They even financed the meeting and mobilised residents to attend the event,&rdquo; Murungi said.Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka and ODM&rsquo;s Raila Odinga attended a rally at Laare Stadium, Igembe North, Meru county, during a NASA tour on February 27. They received a warm reception.Murungi said Munya wanted to show that Raila and NASA are penetrating in Meru and gaining support.&ldquo;We know his political gimmick and we are telling him that Meru is solidly behind Jubilee,&rdquo; he said.His sentiments were echoed by Igembe South MP Mithika Linturi, who said Munya should stop pretending that he backs President Uhuru Kenyatta.&ldquo;We saw many small parties that are not in Jubilee, including Economic Freedom Party, Kanu, KPP and Maendeleo Chap Chap supporting President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s reelection. Why did Munya&rsquo;s PNU fail to endorse Uhuru Kenyatta for the presidency? Munya is sponsoring Raila Odinga&rsquo;s activities. It is obvious he is supporting him for the presidency,&rdquo; Linturi said.But county media relations officer Alex Kiambi said PNU affirmed its support for Uhuru during its delegates&rsquo; conference in Nairobi in October last year.He said Munya has been vocal in drumming up support for Uhuru&rsquo;s reelection.&ldquo;In 2022, Governor Peter Munya will go for President because it is open,&rdquo; Kiambi said.He denied that Munya is backing and funding NASA.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t even know NASA or what it entails. We read about them and their activities in the newspa
