For the longest time now, gospel singer Ringtone has not been nominated for the Groove Awards, which has made him angry.Talking exclusively to Word Is, Ringtone said: "Do you know why they hate me? Very simple, when Pamela was a hit, Daddy Owen won five awards. I feel bad because I am a human being and I think Pamela should have won."He added: "I have never won a Groove award. That's not fair because they are hypocrites. I would like to tell Groove Awards they have run out of ideas. To be honest, Groove is gone."When called for comment, the award's founder Kevin Mulei said the criteria for nominations "has been quite clear and consistent over the years, so we aren't quite clear on where this sentiment breeds from.The panel is open and ready to meet any industry player to discuss any matters touching on them and the nomination process."
