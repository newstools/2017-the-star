That is so wrong and that is not the message here."Mulindi Khayesi added, "God never intended sex between a man and a woman to be just a physical exercise, but spiritual too. She was ranting out of context..."Sheeroh Trillionaire Thuo explained, "Rape, in its rawest form, is in essence sex. It is nonconsensual sex. Sex defined is basically penetration. Rape is penetration without permission."
