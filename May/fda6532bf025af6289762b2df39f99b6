Mombasa residents will remain &ldquo;orphans&rdquo; for five years if Governor Hassan Joho is reelected, Nyali MP Hezron Awiti has said.The governor hopeful said Joho will concentrate on his presidential bid at the expense of service delivery.Joho has announced he will run for the country&rsquo;s top seat in 2022 in a bid to become the first President from the Coast.Awiti said the county is currently orphaned because its boss has focussed on foreign travels during his first term.But this has often been disputed by Joho&rsquo;s handlers, who said the trips have brought in donor funds. Part of the funds have been used to revamp the Coast General Hospital, they say.Awiti said a governor who divides his attention between local and national issues is bound to let one facet suffer.&ldquo;For Joho it is clear that national issues trump county issues. Development issues will take a back seat,&rdquo; he said in a statement to newsrooms on Thursday.But Joho&rsquo;s aide Richard Chacha yesterday said, &ldquo;The governor is capable of handling his campaigns and managing the county.&rdquo; Speaking on the phone, he asked Awiti to concentrate on his campaigns.Awiti, the Vibrant Democratic Party leader, said despite Joho boasting of representing Coast, he features nowhere in the NASA pentagon.The pentagon consists of Raila Odinga, Kalonzo Musyoka, Musalia Mudavadi, Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula and Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto. Awiti said Joho&rsquo;s absence is an indication he cannot serve again as a county or national leader. But Joho has challenged this, saying ODM, under his and Raila&rsquo;s stewardship, takes care of Coast interests. Joho said he does not need to campaign for reelection as his record speaks for itself and voters will take the campaign role.
