A team of six CID officers have been tasked to probe the killing of three children of Kapsoya ward MCA aspirant James Ratemo.Initial investigations indicate the children were tortured, their fingers chopped off, eyes gouged out and their throats slit open before their bodies were dumped in the River Nzoia more than 60 kilometres from their home.Police are holding an uncle of the children, Enock Onsanze, who was last seen with them.He had sent a text message to their mother threatening her for getting married into the family yet she was from a different tribe.&ldquo;In the text message, he told me that I had a short time to return their family wealth because women are not allowed to have a share of the wealth,&rdquo; said Ebby Esaji, the mother of the childrenClifford Nyamweya aged six, five-year-old Dan Nyamweya and Glen Ongaki aged three were reported missing last Saturday.They did not return home after leaving for Eldovil SDA Church.MPs Oscar Sudi and Alfred Keter visited the home of the aspirant. They urged police to quickly help unravel those involved in the killing.&ldquo;We demand a speedy probe into the incident that has caused panic among all parents in Kenya. People are now living in fear and locking their children in houses out of fear following what has happened,&rdquo; Keter aid.The MPs said security personnel should investigate the matter.&ldquo;We are here as parents and leaders. We cannot allow this to happen especially to innocent children. We have to know the truth so that the parents of these children can bury them knowing what happened,&rdquo; Sudi said.The lawmakers asked Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery to personally oversee the probe.&ldquo;We will also raise the matter in Parliament because it touches on the lives of all Kenyans,&rdquo; Keter said.The MPs said leaders in the region will cater for the burial expenses.Ratemo ruled out politics in the killing. He said he has not clashed with any of his opponents or other politicians. He termed the killings &ldquo;evil and the work of the devil&rdquo;.&ldquo;I wonder why someone would do this to my children. It&rsquo;s too much for me to bear and I just leave everything to God,&rdquo; Ratemo said.He said he loved his children so much and does not understand why they had to be killed.&ldquo;I just hope police will help us,&rdquo; Ratemo said.His wife Esaji said she still cannot believe her children are dead.Ratemo is running for Kapsoya MCA on the Kanu ticket.Kanu leader Gideon Moi sent his message of condolence to the family and is expected to visit them.The family was looking for the children and had even put up posters.By Thursday night, all the bodies had been found.Their uncle, Onsanze had already been charged with abduction.A caretaker at the home said he had escorted the children on their way to church, but he met a cousin of the family, identified as Peter, who offered to accompany them to the church, which is about three kilometres away.The cousin, however, met with the uncle of the children who also offered to take them to church. And that was the last time they were seen.Residents of Machine village near Mois Bridge on the River Nzoia spotted the floating bodies of the children. They informed the local administration which called police to retrieve them.One of the bodies was retrieved on Tuesday, the second on Wednesday, while the last one was removed on Thursday.
