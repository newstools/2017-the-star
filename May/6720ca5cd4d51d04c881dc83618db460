Kiharu MP Irungu Kang&rsquo;ata says Kiambu and Nyeri must pay the political debt they owe Murang&rsquo;a &mdash; William Ruto&rsquo;s running mate in 2022 should come from the county.&ldquo;We have sacrificed for a long time, despite us taking the biggest percentage in shaping Kenya&rsquo;s political history,&rdquo; Kang&rsquo;ata said. He is the Murang&rsquo;a Jubilee Senate nominee.Speaking to the Star on Tuesday, the legislator said Murang&rsquo;a should produce the deputy president in 2022.Murang&rsquo;a, believed to be the origin of the Agikuyu community and the epicentre of the Mau Mau war, has not gotten its fair share of political influence, compared to neighbouring Kiambu and Nyeri, Kang&rsquo;ata said.He said Murang&rsquo;a &ldquo;handed&rdquo; the presidency to founding President Jomo Kenyatta after his release from Kapenguria in 1961. Kanu needed him in the Legislative Council of Kenya.&ldquo;Someone had to vacate his LEGCO seat to pave way for Kenyatta to participate in constitutional talks in London in 1962. LEGCO was the heart of African efforts to force changes at the Lancaster House Conferences in the lead-up to self-government and later independence,&rdquo; the MP said.&ldquo;The then Kigumo (in Murang&rsquo;a) legislator and son of former colonial chief Njiri Kigo, Kariuki Njiri, gave his seat to Kenyatta. Didn&rsquo;t Murang&rsquo;a give the presidency to Jomo?&rsquo;&rsquo;He said most successful Nairobi businessmen are from Murang&rsquo;a and have contributed to election of the three Central Kenya Presidents. They are Jomo Kenyatta, Mwai Kibaki and Uhuru Kenyatta. Kang&rsquo;ata has urged the people of Murang&rsquo;a to turn out in large numbers to vote for Uhuru in August. &ldquo;When Uhuru finishes his second term, Kiambu and Nyeri should swallow humble pie because they have had their share during Jomo, Kibaki and Uhuru. &ldquo;I request my counterparts in Murang&rsquo;a to join me in pushing for this agenda in our Jubilee Party,&rdquo; Kang&rsquo;ata said.
