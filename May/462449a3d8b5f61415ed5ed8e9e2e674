She is being held at Ol joro orok police station and will be arraigned in court today. Gikingi chief Mary Njoroge yesterday told the Star the child appeared to have been badly beaten before she was hanged.&ldquo;What pains us so much is the thought of how she got the courage to put a rope round her child&rsquo;s neck even after beating her,&rdquo; she said.

Wangeci had beaten the child the previous evening, according to neighbours who spoke to the chief, and also woke up to beat her on Saturday morning.

She alerted the neighbours and they called the police.The chief and police took the body to the mortuary. The reason behind the killing has not been established, but Njoroge said Wangeci might have felt the child was a burden.
