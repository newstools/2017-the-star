Federal Party of Kenya leader Mong&rsquo;are Okong&rsquo;o yesterday urged governors to heed President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s plea and pay doctors their salary arrears in full.The Nyamira Senator said governors should be humane and honour the return-to-work formula with the doctors.Doctors went on a 100-day strike from December 5 last year, demanding that a June last year CBA be implemented. They wanted pay rises, more medics hired to ease work load, training opportunities and a better work work environment.The pact signed between the Ministry of Health, Council of Governors and the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists' Union barred county governments from victimising doctors who participated in the three-month strike.Okong'o said, &ldquo;The cardinal principle of a return to work formula is the need to avoid victimisation at all costs. Doctors were on a legal strike and deserve to be paid.&rdquo;The FPK presidential candidate accused CoG chairman Peter Munya (Meru governor) of &ldquo;chest-thumping and and practising leadership of impunity&rdquo;.&ldquo;Munya must know that he was elected to serve Kenyans and not his ego. Doctors cannot be held at ransom by one man. Devolution is not a one man show,&rdquo; the senator said.Doctors have claimed that counties are withholding their December, January and February salaries over the strike.Okong'o warned governors against conducting the affairs of devolved units like a private business where they can agree to pay or not to.&ldquo;None other than the President himself has appealed to the governors to consider paying the doctors their salary arrears. It amounts to the highest level of impunity when governors can chest-thump that they are not going to pay yet the money was budgeted for,&rdquo; he said.
