Mostly affected by the rains are commuters from far-flung rural areas of Bamba, Ganze, Jaribuni and Jila, whose roads have become impassable.Bamba resident, Issa Fondo, had to cut short his trip to Kilifi town after the culvert near Bamba town was washed away. &ldquo;As we speak now, the culvert at Kadete Ka Mgunguna on the busy Kilifi-Bamba road has been washed away. Drivers have been forced to use an alternative road, which is also flooded,&rdquo; Fondo said.He attributed the poor state of roads to heavy trucks carrying ballast from Jaribuni to Mariakani where the government is tarmacking a 40km stretch.&ldquo;The lorries carrying heavy loads have left gaps and holes in the roads currently filled with water and inconveniencing other road users,&rdquo; he said.Other areas affected include Mikuluni, Kadzinuni and Stage B near Rare drift. &ldquo;It is tough to access Mikuluni and Stage B at the moment. The road has been entirely covered with mud, giving drivers a hectic time,&rdquo; said driver Juma Karisa.
