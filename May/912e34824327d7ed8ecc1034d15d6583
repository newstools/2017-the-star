The two contenders for the French presidency traded insults in a fiery head to head TV debate, in a key moment of a long and bitter campaign. Centrist Emmanuel Macron said his far-right rival Marine Le Pen's strategy "is to lie", while she called him a shameless "darling of the system". Macron is well ahead in the polls, although his lead has been reduced. The aim of both candidates is to win over the estimated 18% of undecided voters ahead of Sunday's election. For the first time, neither candidate is from a mainstream French party. The debate was heated for most of its 160 minutes, with both candidates throwing personal insults at each other. Le Pen called her 39-year-old rival "the candidate of savage globalisation", happy to sell off France's assets and relinquish control of the country. Macron, in turn, accused the 48-year-old leader of the National Front (FN) of being "the high priestess of fear", saying she talked a lot but "proposed nothing". On the economy and employment: Mr Macron admitted France had failed to tackle unemployment for 30 years, and said his solution would be to give small and medium-sized companies the opportunities to create more jobs and be more flexible. Ms Le Pen asked him why he could not have done these things while economy minister. She said she would protect state assets and French jobs by adopting protectionist trade measures.
