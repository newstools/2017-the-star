South Africa's Vodacom said on Monday it will buy a 35 per cent stake in Safaricom from its parent company Vodafone for 34.6 billion rand (about Sh267.46 billion or $2.59 billion).This will expand its reach into Kenya.Safaricom, which is 40 per cent owned by Britain's Vodafone and 35 per cent by the government, has the largest subscriber base in its home market and dominates the thriving mobile financial services sector through its M-Pesa platform."The proposed transaction will expose Vodacom Group to the attractive high growth Kenyan market, being one of the largest and most advanced economies in east and central Africa that has made significant strides in technological innovation," Vodacom said in a statement.Vodafone will retain a 12.5 per cent interest in Vodafone Kenya, equivalent to five per cent interest in Safaricom, after completion of the proposed transaction, the company said.Completion of the transaction is subject to a number of conditions. The sale will have to be approved by Vodacom's minority shareholders and the Financial Surveillance Department of the South African Reserve Bank. Kenya's Capital Markets Authority will also have to confirm that the transaction does not trigger an obligation for Vodacom to make a mandatory bid for Safaricom.The agreement Vodafone Group has reached with the government will ensure Safaricom continues to have strong Kenyan representation at Board and management levels.It will also ensure the company promotes its continued successful expansion as well as the opportunity to drive M-Pesa to other markets in the continent," Safaricom CEO Bob Collymore said in a statement.Vodafone is the majority shareholder in Vodacom.More on Safaricom: [VIDEO] Safaricom full year net profit rises to Sh48.4 billionAlso read: MPs split on proposed bill to break Safaricom's 'market dominance'
