Tana River Governor Hussein Dado (pictured) has dismissed the NASA lineup, terming it a failed deal, which favoured one community. He said Western and Eastern got a raw deal which will not bear fruit as the positions created of Premier Cabinet Secretary and deputies are unconstitutional and could cost more than Sh20 billion to create. Dado criticised the NASA leaders for failing to come up with a better lineup. He was addressing hundreds of Jubilee supporters during a party at his home in Oda Garsen constituency on Monday.
