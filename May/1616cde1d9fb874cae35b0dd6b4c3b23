Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission investigators yesterday raided the houses of top National Land Commission officials, among them chairman Muhammad Swazuri, and recovered Sh17 million in cash.EACC spokesman Yassin Amarow confirmed the raids but did not reveal in whose house the money was recovered. The money was in $160,000 and Sh 1 million. A second group of investigators raided the offices of the officials in Nairobi.The EACC investigators were hoping to recover monies from all the houses, following allegations of graft that have hit the commission.The homes include those of vice chairman Abigael Mbagaya Mukolwe, chief executive officer Tom Chavangi, finance director Francis Mugo and his deputy.EACC spokesman Yasin Aila said the graft allegations have to do with compensation for individuals and institutions affected by the standard gauge railway project.Former Nation reporter Mugo Njeru has put the spotlight on the NLC in a petition to Parliament. Njeru claims he bribed Swazuri to be compensated for his land in Embakasi that was hived off for the construction of the SGR. Mugo accused swazuri of demanding Sh1.2 million.The graft claims against Swazuri are being investigated by Parliament. Mugo also accused Swazuri of defrauding his wife of an unspecified amount of money she had been awarded as compensation by the NLC.Swazuri is alleged to have revoked the Njeru&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s title deed in favour of another company.Njeru said Swazuri has used his position to enrich himself and wants Parliament to investigate him.Swazuri moved to court to have the Parliament blocked from ejecting him from office. But the National Assembly asked a court to dismiss the petition that seeks to stop investigations against Swazuri. Swazuri had sought orders of the court to stop the House from investigating claims that he received the Sh1.2 million bribe.
