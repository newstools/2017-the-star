Maendeleo Chap Chap candidate for Nyandarua senator, John Methu, has acknowledged the challenges the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission face, but urged the agency to do everything within its power to deliver free, fair and credible elections.He said it is the least Kenyans expect of the commission. Methu said the 2010 Constitution has loopholes that people take advantage of to hinder smooth operations of public institutions, including the IEBC.&ldquo;For instance, the IEBC awards a tender for printing ballots and someone runs to court to seek its cancellation. The commission directs independent candidates to collect signatures from people not registered as members of a political party and someone again runs to court,&rdquo; he said.Methu said despite the hurdles, the IEBC must deliver results that are acceptable, adding it has been given a large amount of money to enable it to perform its functions. He praised IEBC officials in Nyandarua for ensuring due diligence in their work.Methu spoke yesterday at ACK hall, Ol Kalou, after he was cleared by the IEBC to run in August.
