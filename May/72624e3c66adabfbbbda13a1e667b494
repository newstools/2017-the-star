An ODM MCA nominee for Ahero ward, Kisumu county, has criticised the Jubilee administration for the soaring cost of basic commodities.Kennedy Ooko said it is baffling that in Kenya, the price of petrol is lower than that of maize and sugar, which are mainly produced locally. He accused the government of presiding over massive ripoff and colluding with unscrupulous investors to exploit wananchi. Ooko told Deputy President William Ruto to stop with the empty rhetoric over the government&rsquo;s preparedness to resolve the high cost of living. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m shocked that Kenyans are suffering while President Uhuru Kenyatta and Ruto are watching without swift intervention,&rdquo; he said.Ooko said Uhuru and Ruto are hell-bent on raising campaign funds and do not care about what happens to citizens.He appealed to Kenyans to exercise their democratic right and remove the Jubilee administration from power. Ooko said NASA is ready to transform the country.&ldquo;I can tell you for sure that under the NASA administration, Kenya will not be the same again,&rdquo; he said, urging residents to prepare to vote en masse for Raila Odinga.
