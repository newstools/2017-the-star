A Chama Cha Mashinani rally planned for today for the launch of Governor Isaac Rutto’s (pictured) campaign has been postponed for the third time. Sources say it was cancelled due to NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga’s tight schedule. He was expected to make an appearance. The party will instead hold a meeting in Bomet Stadium to name its aspirants who won in last week’s primaries, it said in a statement. “The governor will use the occasion to address issues, including devolution milestones and bottlenecks and also explain to the electorate why NASA is a better option compared to Jubilee,” the statements says.
