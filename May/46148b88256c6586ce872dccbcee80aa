Kenyans online brewed a Twitter storm after Mavuno church put out a tweet that insinuated rape is sex. It read: If sex is only physical why is it that rape is so devastating to a woman that she often chooses to hide it? #Uncensored â€” Mavuno Hill City (@mavunochurchorg) May 21, 2017 Corrie Mwende defended the church, saying: "Sex is more than physical, it is also emotional In no way can/should sex be equated to rape! That is so wrong and that is not the message here." Mulindi Khayesi added, "God never intended sex between a man and a woman to be just a physical exercise, but spiritual too. She was ranting out of context..." Sheeroh Trillionaire Thuo explained, "Rape, in its rawest form, is in essence sex. It is nonconsensual sex. Sex defined is basically penetration. Rape is penetration without permission."
