She will be arraigned at a Malindi court.&ldquo;I have not yet been handcuffed. They said I&rsquo;ve been arrested over incitement after stopping Baricho supply,&rdquo; she said.The steward said the arrest order was issued by powerful people but noted she was only fighting for the plight of workers in her capacity as she is duty-bound.There were allegations that Deputy President William Ruto influenced Kimutai's appointment but CWSB acting chairperson Sureya Hersi denied this.Mackenzie said a court order blocked the appointment and that outgoing CEO Joseph Omwange, who had been acting for 17 months, ought to have been confirmed.She added that Kimutai was hired because of influence, not on merit.CWSB workers are expected to hold demonstrations in Mombasa for the new chief's removal.
