The lucky Kenyan who won the biggest payout in African history of Sh221,331,602 on SportPesa was already celebrating after correctly predicting 15 out of the 17 Mega Jackpot (MJP) games when the phone call that altered his life forever came through shortly after midnight.Leading bookmaker, SportPesa, will unveil the winner on today at a red-carpet ceremony in Nairobi.The consumer, who placed Sh200 on two MJP picks of Sh100 each realised something monumental was on the offing as soon as the French top flight Ligue 1 clash between Dijon FC at home to Bordeaux ended 0-0 as they had guessed.Already assured of a big windfall as a bonus winner, the player could not bear to watch the remaining two games of the week&rsquo;s jackpot&mdash;the North London English Premier League (EPL) derby of Tottenham Hotspur hosting Arsenal and the Italian Serie &lsquo;A&rsquo; clash between Inter Milan and Napoli.The consumer left home to join a best friend at a joint in the outskirts of Nairobi where the pair who play together on the SportPesa platform started discussing on what to do with the millions when a call came through minutes after midnight from a number not saved on their phone book.&ldquo;Do you know who is calling you?&rdquo; the caller asked. &ldquo;No.&rdquo; the winner responded. After establishing their location, the caller then asked, &ldquo;Have you watched football?&rdquo;&ldquo;I was watching the Bordeaux game before going out to have a drink,&rdquo; came the reply.&ldquo;Do you know SportPesa?; &ldquo;I know (SportPesa), I had bet.&rdquo; Had you bet the mega jackpot?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;&ldquo;What was the amount of the mega jackpot?&rdquo;&ldquo;Sh221,300,000.&rdquo;&ldquo;You know, my name is Captain Ronald Karauri,&rdquo; the caller then identified himself as the well-known CEO of SportPesa.&ldquo;What? Are you serious! Are you serious!&rdquo; the winner exclaimed, bursting into joyous laughter.&ldquo;What game were you waiting for?&rdquo; the SportPesa boss went on.&ldquo;After watching Bordeaux, I just went out,&rdquo; came the response. &ldquo;You did not watch Napoli?&rdquo; Karauri posed. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;&ldquo;Now, guess what? (You have won Sh221,331,602 shillings, you are our first mega jackpot winner, congratulations!&rdquo;&ldquo;Whaaaaaaaaaaat! Whaaaaaaaat! Woooow! I can&rsquo;t believe it!
