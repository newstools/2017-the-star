The IEBC has described as &ldquo;a recipe for chaos&rdquo; a court declaration that presidential results announced at the constituency are final.Commission Chairman Wafula Chebukati says, &ldquo;I was dismayed by that ruling for the simple reason that presidential results are supposed to be announced at the national tallying centre by the national returning officer, who is the chairman of the IEBC. That is very clear in the law,&rdquo; Chebukati said.The decision by three judges &mdash; Chacha Mwita, Weldon Korir and Aggrey Muchelule &mdash; knocked down all sections of the election rules and regulations that subject the presidential vote announcements made at the constituencies to verification by a national tallying centre.&ldquo;You cannot have a situation where each constituency returning officer announces results. What if they make mistakes? We have filed an appeal and hope the Court of Appeal will dispose of the matter in good time before the election date because it will be a recipe for a lot more problems than answers,&rdquo; the chairman said.He was speaking in an exclusive interview with the Star.The High Court decision was widely hailed by Raila Odinga and the NASA brigade as a measure to prevent the rigging of the election results by President Uhuru Kenyatta's Jubilee Party.Raila and his running mate Kalonzo Musyoka described results declared at the constituencies as the most authentic.&ldquo;The results declared by the returning officers are final. There should be no super returning officer sitting in Nairobi purporting to tally the results. The work of the national office should and will be to add results from the 290 constituencies,&rdquo; Raila said.The former Prime Minister claimed the national tallying centre at the KICC in 2007 and at Bomas of Kenya in 2013 were used by electoral chiefs to doctor results from polling stations.The allegations were at the heart of his 2013 presidential petition that the Willy Mutunga team dismissed at the Supreme Court.Chebukati said the national tallying centre will remain open but only to duly accredited agents in a bid to enhance transparency and eliminate the controversy that dogged the 2013 polls.In 2013, Raila accused then IEBC boss Issack Hassan of kicking out his agents from the national tallying centre at the Bomas of Kenya.With 97 days to the election, Chebukati exuded confidence that the IEBC will deliver a credible, free and fair election.&ldquo;All the boxes are ticked, we have the technology we need, we have the key personnel who have been trained and we are good to go,&rdquo; he said.According to IEBC plans, the national tallying centre will have Internet connectivity complete with a media centre to enhance accountability.&ldquo;The tallying centre will be be centralized, where the Chairman and the Commissioners will be in charge and supported by our Secretariat,&rdquo; Chebukati said. &ldquo;Only duly accredited agents will be allowed access.&rdquo;The chairman remained emphatic that his team will deliver free and fair polls, exuding confidence that on August 9, Kenyans will resume their daily routines satisfied about the electoral process.&ldquo;The way we are going to do this election, fairness will prevail. How does rigging happen? Rigging happens when systems are not in place, where dead voters come up and vote, there is stuffing of ballot boxes. But we are saying look, we have our systems, you will be verified biometrically and by the use of IDs when you go to vote,&rdquo; he said.The IEBC, the chairman said, has put up a &ldquo;sufficient firewall&rdquo; for their systems against any external hacking.Chebukati said his team was determined to announce the presidential results before the seven-day statutory period provided in law. But even in the worst case scenario, Chebukati promised the presidential poll results will not take &ldquo;a second longer than the time required under the law&rdquo;.&ldquo;Our approach is a balance of speed and accuracy but we look forward to giving results before the timeline provided under the law,&rdquo; he said.The IEBC will deploy two police officers in each of the 40,700 polling stations. This means the polls will be manned by 81,400 cops.There will be over 300,000 election officers on Election Day, making it one of the largest mobilisations in Kenyan history.Chebukati said elections are largely a matter of getting the logistics right and testing the technology in good time.&ldquo;The challenge in 2013 was that critical processes were undertaken at the tail end,&rdquo; Chebukati observed.Already, the IEBC has launched comprehensive training and capacity building for its staff.He said that the Commission has laid out plans to carry out what he termed &ldquo;stringent simulation and stress tests&rdquo; in June, two months to the polls.Chebukati said that the biometric voter verification exercise that kicks of on May 10 provides a tremendous opportunity to test the technology that will be used on Election Day.The new complex &mdash; the Kenya Integrated Electoral Management System &mdash; the fulcrum of the 2017 polls, will be deployed in the verification exercise.French Company Safran Identity Limited has supplied 11,000 gadgets. Some 34,000 remaining kits are expected by early June.Chebukati said the inter-agency collaboration that includes the ministry of Education and the Commission for University Education will determine the authenticity of certificates presented by candidates.The IEBC is compiling a list of all malpractices that occurred in the party primaries, and the chairman says the cases will be addressed by the Code of Conduct Enforcement Committee, within the Commission.Chebukati said the major challenge ahead of the polls remain the numerous court decisions that interfere with the electoral timelines as well as rising political temperatures, leading to tension and pockets of violence.&ldquo;Nonetheless we remain committed to redressing these hiccups and delivering a credible election that is free and fair,&rdquo; he said.
