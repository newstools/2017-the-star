Kenya International Freight and Warehousing Association has moved to court seeking orders to compel Kenya Revenue Authority to renew licenses of its 1,300 members.The group, alongside directors of 14 other clearing and forwarding companies, want the court to suspend licence renewal guidelines citing lack of public participation.William Ojonyo, the association's chairman and CEO of Keynote Logistics, filed the application which Justice Rose Aburili certified urgent on April 28.A hearing date has been scheduled for Wednesday, May 10.KRA and the Commissioner for customs and border control are named as the first and second respondents respectively.The taxman has not renewed the customs agents licenses saying they are processing applications against the new procedures.KRA, through a memo, had extended the validity of the 2016 licenses until April 30 and the agents are now fearing sanctions for operating without 2017 licenses.The companies are pushing to have KRA compelled to issue them with the 2017 licenses as they had applied.They also want the biodata form introduced by the taxman suspended.The group also want the authority to be forced to convene stakeholders consultative forums for discussion on 2018 licensing rules.According to KRA regulations, international companies are licensed to operate for three years while local firms must renew their permits every year.
