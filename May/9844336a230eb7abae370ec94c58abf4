National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale&rsquo;s proposed bill requiring that the IEBC manage all party primaries three or six months before a general election is not a good idea (see P35).It would deny the parties the right to organise the election processes they see fit. What&rsquo;s more, this would be an insanely expensive exercise, at least as costly as the General Election itself.There is no need to bog down the IEBC and the electorate in this manner.What should happen is for the parties to invest in nominations personnel and preparedness in such a way that they only require IEBC technical expertise. Part of the preparations ought to be the keeping of a frequently updated and verifiable members&rsquo; register.Duale&rsquo;s move comes in the wake of the widespread electoral malpractice witnessed in all parties during the primaries. The primaries must never again be as inept, thuggish, thievish and daylight robbery of the electorate&rsquo;s right to vote as they were this year.
