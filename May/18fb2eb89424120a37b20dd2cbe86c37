Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen (JP) is confident he will beat former IG David Kimaiyo (Kanu) on August 8.&ldquo;I will deal him a political blow the same way I thrashed my opponents in the primaries,&rdquo; he said.Murkomen said he was also surprised at the high number of votes he got in the primaries, which he says is an indication that residents are grateful for the work he has done in four years.&ldquo;Many people say I have become popular nationally, but they should know that there was no way I could achieve this without the people of Elgeyo Marakwet. I am proud of them,&rdquo; he told the Star on Monday.Murkomen vanquished his four challengers with a landslide win during the primaries last week.He garnered 83,905 votes. Hopeful John Kangogo was second with 12,724 votes. Others in the Senate race were Michael Kibiwott with 10,200 votes, Barnabas Boit with 6,100 and Mathews Murgor with 3,899 votes.Murkomen said he will play a big role in President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s reelection team.&ldquo;I scored more than 80 per cent of the votes. This is an amazing sign of confidence in me by the people of Elgeyo Marakwet,&rdquo; he said during a victory roadshow in Iten town.Kimaiyo got a direct ticket to run for senator and he says he is ready to battle Murkomen.The former IG is considered a more formidable threat to Murkomen and he is putting in place a well-oiled and organised campaign machine with the backing of Kanu power brokers and some Jubilee insiders.An MP from Eldoret told the Star that they are likely to sponsor a rival to remove Murkomen, whom they accuse of being one of the insiders misleading Deputy President William Ruto in the region.&ldquo;I can assure you that we will ensure we fight to have Murkomen defeated,&rdquo; the MP said.But Murkomen said voters in Elgeyo Marakwet will not be influenced by outsiders on how to elect their leaders.&ldquo;If they are serious they should have done so during the primaries. Let them fight their own battles,&rdquo; he said.Both Murkomen and Kimaiyo come from the Marakwet community and the one who gets the Keiyo votes is likely to win.The county is largely inhabited by the two Kalenjin subtribes.But Murkomen said voters in Elgeyo Marakwet will not be influenced by outsiders on how to elect their leaders.&ldquo;If they are serious they should have done so during the primaries.
