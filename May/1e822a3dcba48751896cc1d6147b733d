Radio presenter Maina Kageni has come out to reveal that he doesn’t live in his mother’s house, after fans insinuated that he’s still under his mum’s roof. As is the norm, Kageni started his day with discussions on his popular breakfast show. This time round, his on-air topic was about young adults and when or if they should move out of their parent’s homes. The topic came up after a judge from Spain ruled that young adults need to move out of their parent’s houses at the age of 22. This is after a 24-year-old woman sued her parents, claiming that they need to continue supporting her financially. Kageni asked listeners for their opinions, with some responding through studio phone calls and on social media. Then suddenly, a Kenyan on Twitter by the name Boniface Atanasi decided to blast Maina Kageni, saying he’s had things easy because he still lives with the mother; “Watu watoke wakae independent, wawache kukaa kama Maina, amekatalia kwa mamake.” That’s when Maina Kageni decided to finally address the rumour, and trust me, he made it clear that he doesn’t live with his mother. “I don’t leave with my mother, for your information Boniface,” said Maina Kageni in a firm voice on air.
