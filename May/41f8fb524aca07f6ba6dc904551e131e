After securing the Erick Shirley Shield for a record of three times since 2015, Impala Saracens Boks over the weekend received a winning bonus of Sh750,000 from Resolution Insurance. The sponsors further presented kit to Impala clubs in a bid to boost the morale of the players and secure wins in the upcoming season.
