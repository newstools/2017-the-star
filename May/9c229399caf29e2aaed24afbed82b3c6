Independent candidates and small parties in Nyandarua have told off National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale for saying they should not give the President and Deputy President conditions in order to support their re-election. They include governor hopeful Moses Kiarie (pictured), Beatrice Kamau (senator candidate) and George Wambugu (Ol Kalou MP aspirant). The aspirants said Duale is sabotaging the UhuRuto reelection bid. They spoke on Tuesday after attending a stakeholders’ meeting convened by IEBC officials at ACK Hall, in Ol Kalou. “We feel pain when we see people like Aden Duale, who do not understand Kenya’s politics, rising to say he does not recognise independent candidates,” Kiarie said.
