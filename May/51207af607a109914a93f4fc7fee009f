The National Land Commission has said the compensation of landowners affected by the second phase of the standard gauge railway from Nairobi to Naivasha will be faster and cheaper.Chairperson Muhammad Swazuri on Tuesday said they expect the 120km stretch to proceed without most of the pitfalls of the first phase.The first phase from Mombasa to Nairobi, which is 472 kilometres, was riddled with claims of double compensations.It was built at a cost of Sh327 billion, with Sh28 billion going to compensation.However, the compensation cost from Nairobi to Naivasha is expected to be lower.Swazuri said compensation will take less time and cost less since most landowners have title deeds and they are are known.On Tuesday he inspected the route from Ngong Hills to Suswa.&ldquo;We cannot at this point tell how much land will be acquired, but since the industrial park will take 30,000 acres, the land to be acquired will be over 40,000 acres,&rdquo; Swazuri said.The cost will be lower since the route cuts through the Nairobi National Park and government land in some places.Phase 2A of the SGR cuts through Nairobi, Kajiado, Kiambu, Nakuru and Narok counties and covers 120km.Swazuri said there will be minimal disturbance to power lines.The route starts from the west end of the Nairobi South Hub (endpoint of the Mombasa&ndash;Nairobi SGR).It then turns south-westwards through the Nairobi National Park and west past Tuala and Ongata Rongai towns.The line then crosses Magadi Road next to the Adventists University and Ngong Road at Embulbul before descending into Rift Valley through a tunnel located northwest of Ngong Hills.It then proceeds northwest to the proposed industrial parks at Mai Mahiu and Suswa where it crosses B3 at Duka Moja.Swazuri said since the route goes through a rocky surface the SGR will have a strong foundation.Swazuri said a number of institutions have been affected, among them 11 churches.He said the uproar over building the railway through the park has been addressed. Conservationists had challenged the decision.We now have a licence from the National Environment Management Authority, Swazuri said."The tunnel is 4.5 kilometers and people on the top of the tunnel are worried. I would like to assure them that they will not be affected, he said adding that the tunnel is eight meters from the surface".
