Jubilee Party&rsquo;s Lamu governor nominee Fahim Twaha has promised a grand battle for the post and &ldquo;a political campaign like no other&rdquo;.He started his campaigns yesterday after receiving his nomination certificate and said his rivals will &ldquo;see dust&rdquo; in the polls.Some 15 candidates were issued nomination certificates for various posts, JP regional director Anthony Kara said.Twaha&rsquo;s rivals include incumbent Issa Timamy, Swaleh Imu and Abdallah Fadhil, all of whom are in NASA.NASA leaders in Lamu, including ODM&rsquo;s point man Rishad Amana, have urged the alliance to reconsider its strategy and suggested consensus in selecting a NASA aspirant.Timamy is in Musalia Mudavadi&rsquo;s ANC, Imu is in Kalonzo Musyoka&rsquo;s Wiper while Fadhil is in Raila Odinga&rsquo;s ODM.Amana said that though Twaha has little support in the county, NASA will hand him an easy victory to Jubilee if they let the three hopefuls run for governor on August 8.&ldquo;It is so confusing. Some of them are projects. If NASA allows the three in the race, Jubilee will win the seat at 10am in the morning,&rdquo; Amana told the Star on the phone yesterday.Rivals in the opposition fear meBut Twaha on Wednesday said his opponents are scared of him.&ldquo;They say I do not have support but then spread propaganda that I am not vying. Why? They are scared. I am in the race and they will see dust,&rdquo; he said.Governor Timamy is banking on his achievements in the county to be reelected.His campaigners have been bashing the Jubilee administration over how it treated Timamy in the wake of the Mpeketoni massacre in 2014.On Wednesday, Twaha said he will floor Timamy because the governor has neglected sections of the county.He cited Hindi ward, saying it has lagged behind because of the skewed development plan Timamy has implemented.The former Lamu East MP said his administration will ensure equal development in the county irrespective of the support bases.&ldquo;Now we are spreading the Jubilee message &mdash; what we will do for the people of Lamu,&rdquo; Twaha said.He said the Jubilee brand is easier to sell in Lamu than any other brand because of the work the government has done in the county.
