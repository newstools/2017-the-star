Abdullahi is from Governor Nathif Jama&rsquo;s Aulihan clan.The decision is meant to appease the Aulihans so he can eat into the incumbent&rsquo;s support base.Haji spoke in Dadaab subcounty, where he wooed residents to back his bid. He said Abdullahi will easily connect with the youth and added that &ldquo;the choice balances clan arithmetic&rdquo;.&ldquo;A committee of elders from his clan had several proposals but finally settled on Abdullahi.
