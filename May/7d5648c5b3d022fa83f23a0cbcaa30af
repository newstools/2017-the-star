Operations at the Nairobi government will be paralysed starting Wednesday should the more than 12,000 workers make good their threat and strike. They have not received their April salaries and the Kenya County Government Workers&rsquo; Union has given the county government until tomorrow 5pm to pay. &ldquo;In the event that our salaries are not paid by Tuesday 5pm, we shall parade our members at City Hall beginning Wednesday until the salaries are fully paid,&rdquo; a notice signed by branch secretaries Boniface Waweru and Benson Oriaro said.The Governor Evans Kidero-led administration is in a crisis after the CBK transferred Sh1.17 billion from its bank account &ndash; meant for salaries &ndash; to the Kenya Revenue Authority to settle arrears.On Saturday, Kidero asked KRA to refund the money, saying he has been restraining the workers from striking. &ldquo;But if by Tuesday the money shall not have been refunded, then we will have no capacity to restrain them anymore.&rdquo;
