A day after Kenyan banks and government institutions were targeted in a large-scale attack against computers worldwide, the government has decided to move its data on cloud. The decision to move to cloud was announced in China when President Uhuru Kenyatta visited Technology firm Huaweii. IT experts believe it is impossible for anyone to get access to data saved in cloud. During the visit, the President witnessed the signing of an agreement between Huawei and the Government of Kenya for Huawei to develop a Government Cloud Services Project. The Government Cloud Services Project entails designing and building Government Cloud infrastructure where all government data and applications will be migrated to. Huawei will also build data exchange and sharing platforms to collaborate government services. On Friday, a computer virus registered more than 75,000 attacks in an estimated 99 countries, including Kenya and the UK. The attack by a ransomware called “WannaCry” crippled all services at public hospitals in the United Kingdom, froze some computers used by the Russian Interior ministry, impaired operations in German train stations and targeted a number of institutions, especially banks in Kenya. On Sunday, the President also witnessed the signing of another agreement where Huawei Technologies offered to train 30 Kenyan youth in ICT in three years. During a meeting with Uhuru at their headquarters in Beijing on Sunday (pictured), the Chinese tech giant announced the donation of an assortment of gadgets to help the police in Nakuru, Kisumu and Eldoret. The equipment includes 6 eNodeB Stations, 150 Radio Trunking Terminals and a Radio Trunking System Core Network and Dispatch System. Huawei and Safaricom are building a Sh 14.9 billion security system. Huawei is also a technology partner in the development of the Standard Gauge Railway. Uhuru said Kenya appreciates the role played by the Chinese company in Kenya’s development and progress.
