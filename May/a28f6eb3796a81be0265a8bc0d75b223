Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi has launched a Sh50 million free milk programme targeting public ECDE schools in the county.He launched the pilot programme at his office on Thursday and warned teachers against mismanaging it.The Governor said the county's aim is to boost the retention rate of children at pre-primary schools. Most children in Kilifi drop out of school for lack of food and water."This milk is specifically for ECD children and not for primary or secondary school students," Kingi said. "Teachers and caregivers should also not use this milk to prepare their tea. We will punish those who deviate from this course."Read: No poverty, illiteracy or hunger when I&rsquo;m Kilifi governor &ndash; KambiAll the 799 public ECD centres across the county will get rations of the milk throughout the second term."We are targeting 89,000 children in the first phase. The focus is to include private ECD centres in the second phase," Kingi said.He said private schools were not considered in the first phase due to financial constraints.The children will each get a 200ml packet of milk twice a week in the pilot phase. This will be increased to a packet a day.Kilifi education chief officer Emmanuel Katana said the free milk will be distributed to the seven sub-counties.Senator Stewart Madzayo said the programme will boost education standards in the county."It is motivation for our children. We anticipate the milk will boost their morale," he said.New Kenya Cooperative Creameries will package and distribute the milk.
