The hearing of a case in which a Ugandan tycoon obtained credit amounting to $200,000 (Sh16 million) from a business enterprise by false pretences was adjourned on Friday.This after the accused, Michael Ezra Mulyoowa, was said to be sick in Germany.He last attended the court early this year and since March he has been admitted to a hospital in Germany.His lawyer Erick Mutua produced a medical report in court showing that Mulyoowa is sick and had to undergo a heart surgery.The court heard that on March 7, prosecution counsel applied for a warrant of arrest to be issued against the accused.This was on grounds that him being a foreigner, he did not seek or obtain court permission to leave jurisdiction of the court.The prosecutor stated that there was no guarantee that the Ugandan suspect will return to face justice.The team told chief magistrate Heston Nyaga that there was no further medical report produced in court on the suspect's current condition at the Germany hospital.The magistrate ordered that all parties, together with the accused person, to appear for a hearing without fail on August 22.Mulyoowa is alleged to have committed the offence in 2010 and about 13 witnesses have already testified.
