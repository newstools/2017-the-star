UDP leader Cyrus Jirongo is in talks with NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga to weigh if they can join hands. Jirongo could help consolidate NASA support in Western if he joins the opposition alliance.NASA brings together Raila of ODM, Wiper&rsquo;s Kalonzo Musyoka, ANC&rsquo;s Musalia Mudavadi, Ford Kenya&rsquo;s Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula and Isaac Rutto of CCM.Jirongo yesterday said he has held meetings with Raila, saying there was no &ldquo;divorce&rdquo; between UDP and NASA.&ldquo;I have given Raila my offer, if I&rsquo;m to join NASA. I&rsquo;m waiting for him to come back to me. If he doesn&rsquo;t return with convincing answers, I will mobilise resources and run for the presidency,&rdquo; he told the Star on the phone. &ldquo;Stereotyping by our leaders is what is annoying me. Those saying that I&rsquo;m a Jubilee clone for Western just because I&rsquo;m raising serious issues affecting the community must be stupid and insane. Only a mad man can go to Jubilee for support.&rdquo; Jirongo said he sought to know why NASA had only brought five communities together instead of 43, adding that amounted to a repeat of what President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto did by sharing the government between two tribes.Jirongo said he has not yet dropped his bid for the top national seat, until an agreement is reached. The former Lugari MP had earlier said he would not run for the top seat if NASA named Mudavadi the flagbearer. Last week, Jirongo said Luhyas were shortchanged in the NASA lineup.Jirongo was reacting to claims by political analyst Wasai Nanjakululu that his plans to run for President could be sponsored by Jubilee to split Western votes.Nanjakululu said that Jirongo&rsquo;s plan would be disruptive to NASA&rsquo;s agenda in Western.&ldquo;Luhyaland will decide at the August election. NASA needs to marshal at least 90 per cent of Western vote to achieve its goal. Jirongo should not be ignored, because he could cause big damage on the ground,&rdquo; the analyst said.Yesterday, Jirongo said it was &ldquo;foolish&rdquo; for one to imagine that Jubilee can fund his campaigns, since he must declare the source of his funding if he decides to contest.Vihiga Senator George Khaniri asked Jirongo to join NASA and strengthen the alliance.&ldquo;I want to urge my brother Jirongo that the solution to rescue Kenyans from the bad leadership by Jubilee is to unite,&rdquo; he said.Khaniri said that going it alone will split the Luhya votes.Lugari MP Ayub Savula said it is Jirongo&rsquo;s constitutional right to run for the presidency, just like any other Kenyan.Last month, Mudavadi urged Kenyans to accept any of the four NASA principals who would picked to fly the opposition flag on August 8.He said it would be wrong for any of their supporters to boycott the election if their preferred candidate is not picked.Mudavadi said, &ldquo;As NASA co-principals, we don&rsquo;t want to hear the Kambas say they will not vote if Kalonzo is not picked as the flagbearer, Luos say No Raila, No NASA, or Luhyas pressing to support Jubilee if Mudavadi or Wetang&rsquo;ula is not given the mantle.&rdquo;He said any NASA supporter who doesn&rsquo;t vote will help Jubilee win.&ldquo;NASA is my brainchild and it&rsquo;s me who invited other principals from ODM, Ford Kenya and Wiper, because I knew none of us would topple President Kenyatta and Ruto alone,&rdquo; Mudavadi said.He said they resolved to stick together, regardless of the candidate, adding each of them is aware of the need to bring about change and none is ready to go it alone.Mudavadi described NASA as the victorious vessel capable of sending Jubilee home. &ldquo;Choose wisely but remember ANC candidates as you cast your vote on August 8,&rdquo; he said.
