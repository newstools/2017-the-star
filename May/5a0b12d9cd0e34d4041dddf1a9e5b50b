NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga should only ask for presidential votes and not elective seats for his party ODM from Luhyas, Lugari MP Ayub Savula has said.Raila should leave the elective seats to ANC and Ford-Kenya, he said.&ldquo;We have agreed that since Musalia Mudavadi (ANC) and Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula (Ford-K) sacrificed their presidential ambitions for Raila, he [Raila] should leave the rest of governor, senator, MP, woman rep and MCAs to fellow NASA anchor parties in the spirit of give and take,&rdquo; Savula said.&ldquo;We want more MPs on other anchor parties to effectively oversight a Raila presidency because you can&rsquo;t trust ODM to oversight him.&rdquo;Savula was addressing supporters at Chekalini, Lugari constituency, on Friday.The plan, which has taken root, especially among ANC and Ford-K candidates in Western, sets the stage for a bruising battle for seats among candidates presented by NASA affiliates.But Kakamega governor Wycliffe Oparanya, who is to lead Raila&rsquo;s presidential campaigns in the region, has said that there is no such agreement. He said all NASA affiliates will face-off for all elective seats except the presidency. Savula said all NASA candidates will campaign for Raila, but he should spare them the competition for governor, senator, MP and woman rep.
