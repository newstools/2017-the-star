The county governments could be headed for a crisis because there is no legal framework on transition of power after the election, Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya has said.While there is a law guiding how power should be transferred from the outgoing to incoming President, there is none on how and when a governor-elect should take office in the event a siting governor is defeated.&ldquo;There must be a legal framework because someone can win today and then he goes running the following day to take office,&rdquo; Oparanya said.He spoke last Friday after signing three county bills into law. They are the Kakamega County Teaching and Referral Hospital, County Public Service Board and County Urban Areas Management bills.Oparanya said none of the legislation passed by county assemblies in four years has been gazetted.&ldquo;This was an oversight because unlike the laws passed by the National Assembly, they do not have commencement dates. But this is being rectified,&rdquo; he said.Oparanya said all county governments have until May 30 to forward their laws to the Government Printers for gazettement.This means any action taken by the county governments based on the laws could be illegal.But constitutional lawyer Laban Anziya said it is a complicated matter because gazettement is what makes laws recognisable. &ldquo;The laws would still be recognised as long as they don&rsquo;t offend the Constitution,&rdquo; he said. Kakamega has enacted 21 bills in four years. Sixteen bills are still being processed and eight are with the executive.
