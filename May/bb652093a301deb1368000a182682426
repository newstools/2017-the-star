National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale has accused NASA principals of being part of a syndicate of land grabbers of more than 500,000 acres in Lamu county.Speaking when he accompanied President Uhuru Kenyatta on his Lamu tour at Mkunguni Square on Wednesday, Duale said the Jubilee government had made in a lot of effort to ensure grabbed land is handed back to the residents.In 2015, the national government revoked titles of more than 500,000 acres of land belonging to 22 ranches in Lamu said to have been irregularly acquired.Duale (pictured) said much of the grabbing happened when NASA principal Raila Odinga was in office as Prime Minister while James Orengo was Lands minister.He said Raila and his allies allowed and watched as many atrocities were committed, including land injustices that were perpetrated against the people of Lamu.They have nothing new to offer Kenyans, Duale said.Land is still the cause of many conflicts in Lamu county. The fact that most of the lands were classified as public has made it hard for locals to acquire title deeds to protect their lands from grabbers.The majority leader said there was massive land grabbing in Lamu during the time Orengo was the Lands minister. He wondered whether such people should be trusted once again.&ldquo;Raila and Orengo worked together to ensure they weren&rsquo;t held accountable.Tell me what such a group can do if they are allowed to run the country,&rdquo; Duale said.He said the Jubilee government would ensure all land injustices are looked into and resolved.Mining CS Dan Kazungu accused NASA of openly marginalising and discriminating against the Coast people along religious and ethnic lines.&ldquo;Check out the NASA principals, no single person from the coast.They have just been left to escort the top principals.Why vote where you are not even recognised,&rdquo; he said.Water CS Eugene Wamalwa said he is confident that 70 per cent of Kenyans support Jubilee Party and said the opposition has nothing new to offer Kenyans.
