You&rsquo;d think modernisation &mdash; paving stones and streetlights &mdash; would be welcome.Think again.Some residents of Faza, Lamu East, want the county remove and replace Cabro paving because it makes their shoes wear out faster than tarmac.The residents say they incur big losses from frequently replacement of their mostly inexpensive footwear because the surface is not smooth.Resident Mohamed Shosi yesterday said although they are grateful to the county government for modern street pavements, they consider it a luxury many cannot afford at this time.He spoke in Faza town. &ldquo;We are not saying the Cabro streets aren&rsquo;t good .... But as it is now, people are complaining that their shoes are wearing out much faster and therefore want the Cabro removed. We feel our complaints are genuine and should be considered,&rdquo; Shosi said.Streetlights hurt businessResidents have threatened to remove the Cabro themselves if the county government does not act soon. The county government has spent considerable sums to instal the fitted stones in towns and some village paths to ease movement.The county government also installed street lights in various towns in the county. These are supposed to make areas safer and allow business to extend into the night. But shopkeepers have also complained that street lights have reduced sales of torches.&ldquo;Before street lights were installed, I made good money selling torches and other lighting appliances. &ldquo;That has changed since people no longer need torches. The sales are bad. We can&rsquo;t do anything or complain, but it is hurting business,&rdquo; resident Abdulrahman Sifa said.
