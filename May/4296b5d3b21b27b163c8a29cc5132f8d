The Political Parties Disputes Tribunal has nullified Jubilee's Party's Mombasa nominations and ordered the appointment of a new county elections board.The decision followed a complaint by Patrick Kabundu, who is county secretary and a member of the County Executive Committee. He raised issues concerning the constitution of the board and the manner in which the primaries were carried out on April 26.In a statement on Friday, chairman Kyalo Mbombu said Jubilee Party must ensure the interests of the complainant and politicians whose names were excluded are met in fresh nominations. The party will also meet the complainant's costs.Kabundu's petition states the hopefuls whose names were not on the ballot papers were Hussein Kabilia (Mvita MP), Leonard Mwaita (Tudor MCA), Farida Ali (Mtopanga MCA), Naftal Mwaghumba (Kipevu MCA) and Naomi Kemunto (Mtongwe MCA).The tribunal also stopped President Uhuru Kenyatta's Jubilee Party from forwarding the winner's certificates to the IEBC pending the hearing and determination of Kabundu's petition.Read: Argawal, Noor reject Nyali nomination results, Ashraf celebrates victoryAlso read: Mandago, 200 Jubilee Party aspirants threaten to boycott Uasin Gishu primariesThe other respondents in the matter are the NEB, the CEB, Thuria Hersi, governor aspirant Sulieman Shahbal and Beatrice Gambo. Interested parties were listed as Kibwanna Abdalla, Ahmed Mohamed, Christopher Muteti, Naomi Kemunto, Farid Mohamed and Naftal Mwaghumba.Kabundu said the CEB's constitution violated the party's rules and that those who elected members were from Kilifi county. He also said Hersi is a member of the Coast Water Services Board and should not participate in political matters."There was also an allegation that the CEB was dominated by people from one community, who were related to or allied to [Shahbal]," read the statement. The tribunal said it could not confirm the claims.Kabundu told the tribunal he wrote letters on March 15 and 27, regarding the board's membership, and that this was confirmed in affidavits by Muteti and Mohamed, who are MCA aspirants in Changamwe.Mbombu said the respondents objected saying Kabundu had not exhausted internal dispute resolution mechanisms and that the issues he raised were out of the tribunal's jurisdiction.They also said the complaints were "in bad faith, frivolous, vexatious and an abuse of the court process and should be struck out with costs".But it noted its mandate includes handling disputes between a members of a political party and the party.Mbombu further said it was confirmed that Kabundu tried to have the matter addressed internally "more than a month before the nomination exercise and all the way beyond...".The tribunal has so far dismissed Wavinya's Ndeti's win in the nominations for Machakos governor and John Mbadi's as Suba MP.Mbombu said on Friday that the party defied a court order by carrying out the nominations. He ordered Kalonzo Musyoka's party to carry out repeat nominations within 48 hours.Ndeti told journalists outside court that she was ready for a repeat of the nominations and expressed that she will once again defeat Deputy Governor Bernard Kiala.In Suba, ODM was directed to repeat nominations in seven polling stations within 72 hours.More on this: [VIDEO] Tribunal nullifies Wavinya Ndeti's Machakos win, orders fresh nominations in 48 hoursAlso read: Tribunal nullifies Mbadi's Suba MP nominations win, orders repeat
