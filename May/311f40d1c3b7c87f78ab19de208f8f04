South Sudan former army Chief Paul Malong has claimed his life is in danger few days after he was dismissed by President Salva Kiir.He claimed that he is currently surrounded by forces loyal to President Kiir with orders to arrest or kill him.President Kiir appointed James Ajongo to replace Malong according to the Minister of Defence Kuol Manyang Juuk.Read; South Sudan president Salva Kiir replaces army chief Paul Malong with James AjongoMalong, who is accompanied by some officers, is currently at Yirol, the capital of Eastern Lakes State, South Sudan.&ldquo;I just want a safe passage to Aweil my home, Northwestern South Sudan, where he appointed me from, and to report back to my people alive and in one being with my family,&rdquo; Malong said.In a press statement on Friday, Malong said he poses no threat to Kiir and his Government adding that he wants to go home.&ldquo;This is a request I make earnestly and in good faith and I know that any careless move on my side or the President&rsquo;s side could trigger bad consequences for this country."&ldquo;I have served this country diligently and with all my energy since my youth both as a soldier and in public civilian service in Governorship of the great State of Aweil."Malong&rsquo;s replacement comes in the wake of resignations by senior generals citing tribal bias and war crimes.South Sudan Government has however played down the significance of Malong's removal, calling it "just a normal practice of changing somebody and bringing in another person."In February, the military's head of logistics, Thomas Cirillo Swaka, resigned, citing rampant human rights abuses by the military and the dominance of the president's Dinka ethnic group.His announcement brought a wave of other resignations by generals and civil servants who made similar accusations against the government.Both Kiir and Malong are from the Dinka community, but Ajongo is a Luo from Aweil, in the north-west of the country.Ajongo joined the Sudan People's Liberation Army, the formal name of the South Sudanese military, in 1983, when it was still a rebel group fighting for independence from neighbouring Sudan.But Kiir's government has denied any involvement in recruiting Dinka irregulars.Read; South Sudan's ousted army chief Malong 'in a fighting mood', says President KiirAlso read; South Sudan president Salva Kiir replaces army chief Paul Malong with James AjongoSouth Sudan, the world&rsquo;s newest nation, has been steeped in civil war since 2013 when Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, fired his deputy, Riek Machar, a Nuer.The action prompted a conflict that has plunged parts of the oil-producing country into famine, paralysed public services and forced 3 million people - a quarter of the population - to flee their homes.According to the United Nations, the spate of violence that rocked the country amounts to ethnic cleansing and risks escalating to genocide.
