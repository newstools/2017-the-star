"I called the office...maybe the person was not informed. If an independent candidate sent a representative what would happen?But Chebukati said there was no problem with candidates sending representatives. "It is allowed in the law. If the candidates are engaged, we have no problem with representatives."The meeting clarified legal and operational requirements for nomination of candidates as well as qualifications for each elective position.The meeting of presidential candidates took place at Lillian Towers, a stone's throw away from IEBC Headquarters at Anniversary Towers in Nairobi.The National Super Alliance and Jubilee Party are already locked in a fierce war over the declaration of presidential results. On Friday, Uhuru rebuked NASA for threatening to boycott elections if an appeal by IEBC, challenging constituency declaration of presidential results, is successful.&ldquo;People should concentrate on looking for votes peacefully instead of threatening the IEBC and the Judiciary. If you believe people will buy your agenda, you do not have to use threats and intimidation,&rdquo; he said.More on this: NASA threatens to boycott polls if IEBC appeal on vote tallying goes throughAlso see: [VIDEO] Uhuru tells off NASA for threatening elections boycott
