Embu nominated MCA Rosemary Mutuuri has asked speaker Justus Mate to get her a cook’s job at the EALA. Mate is one of five JP nominees for the East African Legislative Assembly who have been vetted and are awaiting Parliament’s approval. Mutuuri is running for Nthawa ward MCA on the Jubilee Party ticket. “When you are there, please get jobs for those who might not return to the assembly. As old as I am, I will be there, even if it means cooking tea,” she said on Thursday. Mutuuri spoke in the county assembly during debate on the supplementary budget when Mate’s nomination arose. “By virtue of running as a genetically modified MCA ,I’ll not go through, make me your personal assistant,” MCA Joseph Mwaniki said. Mate thanked all his well-wishers.
