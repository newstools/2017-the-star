Gospel homosexual singer George Barasa, alias Joji Baro or Jay Bee, is not happy with some Kenyan celebrities.Joji Baro, who is never afraid of speaking out his mind, was angered by a photo of media personality Jalang'o taking selfies and videos during the late Churchill Show comedian Ayeiya's burial.The multi-talented artiste told off Jalang'o and other Kenyan celebrities with such behaviour, asking them not to show up at his funeral if all they would do is take selfies instead of grieving with his family.It is reminiscent of the quote: "Don't send me flowers when I'm dead; if you like me send them while I'm alive," by Brian Clough.
