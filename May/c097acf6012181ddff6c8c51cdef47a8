Deputy President William Ruto yesterday withdrew an appeal he had filed three years ago challenging a ruling requiring him to pay Adrian Muteshi Sh5 million.Ruto, however, did not explain to the Court of Appeal the reasons behind his decision and neither did he indicate if he obliged with the High Court order and paid Muteshi.Muteshi was displaced from Eldoret during the 2007 post-election violence and his farm taken.He accused Ruto of unlawfully taking over his farm and sought court intervention.After hearing the case, the High Court ruled in his favour. Justice Roselyn Ougo ordered Ruto to pay Sh5 million as compensation for unlawfully possessing 100 acres in Uasin Gishu that belonged to an internally displaced person. She said Ruto was a trespasser as the evidence adduced in court clearly showed that Muteshi was the owner of the disputed land.Aggrieved by this, Ruto filed an appeal. Ruto in his appeal had said he was not found to have committed any fault in the process of acquisition, transfer, possession and ownership of the disputed parcel in Uasin Gishu county.He wanted the appeal court to suspend the decision of the High Court that ordered him to pay Sh5 milion to Muteshi. He had argued that he would suffer irreparable injury if that amount was paid.
