Two Western governors&rsquo; bids to defend their seats in August 8 could be shattered on integrity grounds from two High Court rulings set for next month.Governors Wycliffe Oparanya (Kakamega) and Moses Akaranga (Vihiga) risk not being cleared by accountability authorities over questions in the management of county funds.Director of Public Prosecutions Keriako Tobiko yesterday told the Senate County Public Accounts and Investments Committee, chaired by Kisumu Senator Anyang Nyong&rsquo;o, rulings on cases challenging his recommendation on the governors to be charged are set for next month.Oparanya&rsquo;s case will be decided on June 21, while Akaranga&rsquo;s on June 20. Oparanya is facing charges of defying the committee&rsquo;s summonses to respond to audit queries on county spending since he took office in 2013. Akaranga is facing charges of misuse of county funds.Tobiko said Oparanya cited the Constitution and other legal procedures in questioning the legality of the charges for his failure to appear before the committee, yet he is not the county&rsquo;s accounting officer.The DPP recommended the governors charged following investigations conducted by the DCI. &ldquo;This issue of defying Senate summonses by persons holding public office is a tragedy and total subversion of our Constitution. Accountability is entrenched in the Constitution for all public officers,&rdquo; Tobiko said.He added, &ldquo;Oparanya&rsquo;s case has been pending before the court, judgement will be on June 21 and I am restrained to comment on its merits and demerits because I may be in contempt.&rdquo; Tobiko, however, challenged senators to come up with laws to empower the committee and the House to issue warrants of arrest to any witness who ignores the summonses.&ldquo;If Article 125 of the Constitution gives Parliament powers to summon any witness, then why is it that this committee has no powers to issue warrants of arrest yet it has powers similar to that of the High Court?&rdquo; he said.Tobiko said the two Houses and committees can be empowered to issue warrants of arrest and fines by introducing new provisions in the enacted Parliament Powers and Privileges Bill, 2014. &ldquo;There is a lot that this committee and Parliament can do to empower themselves instead of overrelying on other prosecution agencies,&rdquo; he said.The Nyong&rsquo;o-led PAC committee invited Tobiko, the IEBC, Controller of Budget and the Auditor General to give their opinion on whether Oparanya should be barred from contesting.
