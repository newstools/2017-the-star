Sergeant Grace Rantille&rsquo;s has been rewarded with a personal rifle by the National Police Service for her great exploits this year in full-bore target shooting tournaments.The General Service Unit Sergeant was on the verge of winning the Kenya Open over the weekend but settled for the third place because of using an unfamiliar gun.Rantille had to surrender her usual rifle to Inspector of Police, Simon Ndambuki, whom she shares with after the both of them qualified for the championships finals.&ldquo;It would be hard to take the rifle away from IP Ndambuki for Rantille. I believe if she had a rifle she is accustomed to, Rantille would have become the first lady to win the Kenya Open,&rdquo; said Commissioner of Police Anthony Kamitu, who is also the national full-bore team manager. &ldquo;To reward her hard work and potential, Rantille will get her personal rifle,&rdquo; added Kamitu.The mother of two, scored 273, 20v and settled for position three in Kenya Open. With the feat, Rantille became the third lady in history of Kenya Open to finish the showpiece in the top three after Defence Forces Rifle Association duo of Farhiya Mohammed (2013) and Nune Bonaya (2015).&ldquo;I am thankful to God for this favour and I also appreciate the good and encouraging gesture by my employer. I am sure having a personal rifle will have a big impact on my performance,&rdquo; noted Rantille, the new Super X marksman in town.&ldquo;It was great experience to shoot in the championship finals. I now look forward to qualifying to represent Kenya at next year&rsquo;s United Kingdom Bisley for the first time ever,&rdquo; intimated Rantille, who beat SuperX and X Class sharpshooters to win the Kenya Defence Forces Cup staged between May 2 and 5 in Nanyuki.The sergeant&rsquo;s impressive performances have seen her scale target shooting ranks and she has been promoted two classes in a period of 21 days. Rantille won the KDF shoot as a Class &lsquo;O&rsquo; trigger puller after which she moved up the ladder to Class X, and after a week-long competition, she was promoted to SuperX on Saturday.Rantille could not forget to show gratitude to her coach and GSU teammate IP Ndambuki for holding her hand in the sport since 2010 when she joined target shooting.Meanwhile, other firers who were promoted at the Kenya Open include Directorate of Criminal Investigations&rsquo; Peter Muli (from Class X to SuperX) and DFRA&rsquo;s Brendan Ajiambo (from O to X).
