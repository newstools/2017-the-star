Incase you have forgotten let me just remind you that on that day you almost made us walk from Mombasa road to Huruma. Hii dunia ni ndogo sana.&rdquo; The post went viral with many lashing out at Waeni&rsquo;s manager, claiming that he was the author of the Instagram post and that he is &lsquo;killing&rsquo; the young superstar&rsquo;s talent. Jalang&rsquo;o denied the claims.&ldquo;Joe &lsquo;Mwas&rsquo; Mwangi asked for an interview on radio Maisha when I was still there and I gave them a chance. All went well and after a few weeks, Waeni&rsquo;s manager begged for an interview on my show, Jalang&rsquo;o With The Money (which is over now) and I agreed. Before they came Mwas asked me to give them money for their cab fare to the show and the producer of the show sent him Sh5,000 on Mpesa,&rdquo; He told Word Is, &ldquo;After the show, Wendy&rsquo;s manager demanded another Sh5,000 for cab fare back home but this time round, he was not given but they organised transport for them. I was not meant to give out money apart from those who were participating.&rdquo;
