Kate Middleton’s sister, Pippa Middleton, is clearly keen that her own wedding should feature a palace, albeit a crystal one. For this is the £100,000  (about Sh13 million) glass conservatory-style structure that Pippa Middleton is having installed in the garden of her family home for Saturday’s celebrations. Not content with a traditional canvas marquee, Pippa, 33, who is marrying multi-millionaire hedge fund boss James Matthews, 41, has had the bespoke glass orangery shipped from Belgium. The process is being overseen by Peppers Marquees, which holds the only royal warrant for supplying marquees to the Prince of Wales. According to sources, workmen have been busy since the weekend putting up the structure on a camouflaged stage in a field at the rear of Michael and Carole Middleton’s home in Bucklebury, Berkshire. The two will tie the knot on Saturday.
