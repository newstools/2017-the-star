Kenya Copyright Board has partnered with CMO Solutions Ltd to unveil a mobile app to catch fraudsters purporting to be collecting music royalties. M-Tambua is system that provides organisations with a simple and effective identity verification platform that helps to deter fraudsters from using Kecobo or one of the CMOsâ€™ (Mpake, Kamp or Prisk) brands to defraud customers or the public. A number of businesses that use music have encountered scenarios where some people have walked into their premises and claimed to be copyright enforcement agents. They then harass and confiscate music material. They are sometimes accompanied by police officers. The app has a database of authorised field officers.
