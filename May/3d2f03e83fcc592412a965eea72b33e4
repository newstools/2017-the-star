Matatu owners have said laxity among traffic police is to blame for the Saturday accident that claimed more than 20 lives on Nairobi-Nakuru highway.Association chairman Simon Kimutai said on Monday that the Gilgil accident could have been avoided if police at roadblocks on the route acted."Police did not flag down the bus for speeding or for operating on the wrong route. It is unfortunate Kenyans died as a result of their negligence."Kimutai told a press conference in Nairobi that the bus went through five police roadblocks before it was involved in the accident.The Githurai 45 Sacco bus was carrying passengers to western yet it is only licenced to ply the Githurai route.Read: 20 dead, several injured in Nakuru-Nairobi accidentOn Saturday, NTSA director general Francis Meja said the vehicle had been removed from the sacco membership list over disciplinary issues.Meja said the its driver "recklessly" overtaking a trailer resulting in a head-on collision with an oncoming truck."We have roadblocks at Kabete, Kikuyu, Uplands, Naivasha and Gilgil.
