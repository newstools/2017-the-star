Homa Bay County Referral Hospital has been faced with acute shortage of water and power outage for a week. The hospital has not paid bills amounting to Sh1 million for both electricity and water. County KMPDU chairman Ben Otieno said operations have been hurt. “We’ve been reduced to using candles to perform operations at night. The only generator we have has broken down,” he said. Otieno said health workers work under difficult conditions, and the situation has been worsened by the shortage of medical supply. For two days, patients’ caretakers have asked that they be discharged. Damaris Atieno, 42, requested the hospital’s administration to discharge her ailing husband following the crisis. “I’ve spent the little money I had in buying candles for night use. We can’t get food because they lack water at the hospital,” she said. Health executive Lawrence Oteng’ acknowledged the challenge and said they are working to resolve the situation.
