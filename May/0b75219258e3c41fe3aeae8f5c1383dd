A Pokot peace crusader was shot dead by unknown people in Loruk, Baringo, on Monday.Limale Longoria, 50, had been brokering peace between Tugens and Pokots, whose 10 cows and 60 goats were stolen during the 5 pm attack.Tension remains high as the killing sparked accusations from the warring sides.Earlier on Wednesday, armed Pokots attacked Tugen herders and made away with over 400 goats. No casualties were reported.Longoria's killing came barely a week after Pokot bandits attacked Ng&rsquo;aratuko and killed two Tugens - Kiptuisang Lemugan, a 13-year old class six boy of Kosile Primary school, and a herder named Endao Ageno.They stole more than 600 goats from Yatya, Kagir and Natan and escaped towards Seretion in Tiaty sub-county. There was a fierce exchange of fire between police reservists and the bandits.Luruk Sub-location Chief Samuel Kamuren said more than 2,000 Tugen residents have fled Loruk fearing retaliatory attacks by Pokot bandits.&ldquo;Ninety per cent of Tugens have fled Loruk trading centre and are now living in IDP camps in Chepkewel, Sibilo and Moinonin,&rdquo; he said, adding they were in dire need of food and water.Baringo county commissioner Peter Okwanyo urged the warring Tugen, Ilchamus and Pokot communities to remain calm as KDF troops, regular police and the KPR flush out the bandits.
