The last-minute headlong rush for independent tickets witnessed at the Registrar of Political Parties&rsquo; offices at Lion Place, Waiyaki Way, Nairobi, since Tuesday is unprecedented.With the anti-party hopping laws, disgruntled and dissatisfied candidates had nowhere to go but independent &ndash; and they have done so with a vengeance.Like the political parties and their primaries, the ROPP has turned out not to have the capacity to handle a big turnout.More time needs to be allowed for independents to quit their parties. Spending a workday week pursuing a number of stamps and signatures in a process that handles one case at a time is not acting smart.The disengagement process should be simplified and digitised, making good use of email and M-Pesa.Hundreds of independents that come from every corner of Kenya have yet to be processed. A faster and more efficient way of processing future political divorcees has to be developed to protect their rights and voters&rsquo; options.
