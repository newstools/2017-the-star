Former outlawed Mungiki sect leader and an aspirant for the Laikipia senator seat Maina Njenga has denied he has integrity issues that might hinder him from contesting for the seat.Speaking to the press in Nanyuki town after a meeting with the IEBC yesterday, Njenga said he was investigated and cleared a long time ago. He said some people wanted to soil his name for political reasons. &ldquo;Everyone has a history. We are not living in historical times as they can also say [opposition chief] Raila Odinga tried to overthrow the government at one time,&rdquo; said Njenga.He said bygones should be bygones since he was not found guilty of any crime and was cleared. Njenga said everyone, at some point, was in the wrong corner. He said the issue was being driven by people with ill motives and personal interests.
