I will clear all that next week,&rdquo; Kabogo said.There have been claims that Kabogo intends to join a team of politicians, who lost in the Jubilee nominations, to form a movement that will give independent candidates a voice.However, the county boss, accompanied by Deputy Governor Gerald Githinji, dismissed them as &ldquo;empty rumours&rdquo;.Kabogo was inspecting the construction of a modern labour ward in Thika Level-5 Hospital. This was his first official duty and public appearance after the party polls.The reproductive health unit will be up and running by the beginning of next month.He expressed pride in what his administration has achieved, especially in healthcare, saying all that is meant to improve residents&rsquo; lives.&ldquo;Kiambu has been rated amongst the best counties in terms of healthcare. We want to maintain that lead,&rdquo; Kabogo said.
