Laikipia West MP Ndiritu Muriithi has criticised Laikipia governor Joshua Irunmgu for allegedly being unable to ensure the security of the county residents.In a statement, Muriithi said the governor was not doing enough to protect the lives and property fog the people after a security guard was hurt and is fighting for his life in hospital after a renewed attempt to invade Kifuku Ranch on Wednesday evening."The governor of Laikipia has abdicated a critical responsibility of raising his voice against the continued injustice being perpetrated against his people. The logical conclusion can only be that he is complicit to these unwarranted invasions unless he comes out clearly and speaks out against them." His statement read.The MPsaid the attacks have become a trend of dispossessing land from its legal owners mostly to those legally-held land through illegal means."The country has been experiencing well spread rains and the excuse that these invaders are in search of grass and pasture for their livestock is no longer tenable yet senior officials in the Laikipia county government have been watching law being broken left, right and centre without taking any action to assure and protect the people who have given them leadership mandate."In more than four months, about 10,000 pastoralists from Baringo, Isiolo and Samburu counties with around 135,000 cattle have invaded Laikipia.Read: Land invasion wrecks LaikipiaIn March this year, an estimated 10,000 acres were set ablaze in the Laikipia Nature Conservancy.
