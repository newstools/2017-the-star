Eighteen presidential candidates have so far expressed their interest in the race for State House, a record number.Among other things, this raises questions about the management of the Presidential Debates that will be broadcast live on mainstream and social media.The debates will be much more enriched and valuable for democracy the narrower the list becomes and the more it focuses on real contenders.To achieve this, and to avoid the kind of &ldquo;haki yangu&rdquo; litigation that so often stops the right thing from happening in Kenya nowadays, the debates should be staggered into three parts &ndash; the first featuring all 18, the second the running mates and the third the real contenders.The first debate is unlikely to be particularly productive, even if it is given two hours, which works out at about seven minutes per speaker.Future debates should feature the principals players only: Those who have a certain meaningful percentage in the opinion polls, a measure that is used very effectively in the mature democracies.
