It was raining and it veered off and slipped into the river,&rdquo; Mwamuye Mngoma said.He said after the lorry fell into the river, two people surfaced. A third man surfaced as the two were being rescued.&ldquo;He appeared for a few seconds and we saw him being swept away at a very high speed and we could do nothing because he was far away and we were still struggling with the two,&rdquo; he said.
