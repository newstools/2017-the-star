There is a new twist in the race for the ODM Kisumu Central MP ticket.This is after the Political Parties Tribunal declared Ken Obura the bona fide winner.The tribunal, led by Kyalo Mbobu, on Monday directed ODM to issue Obura the nomination certificate.Former TNA secretary general Onyango Oloo on Saturday had filed a case with the tribunal challenging the nomination of Fred Ouda.He said electoral offences were committed during the polls.The tribunal rejected the announcement of Oloo as the winner.It said the chair of the elections board assumed the returning officer&rsquo;s position without the knowledge of other members and declared Oloo the winner.Ouda had been given the certificate following demonstrations by his supporters after Obura was declared the winner.They chanted, &ldquo;No Ouda, no Raila. No Ouda, no peace, no Ouda, no Uhuru.&rdquo;The results were announced by returning officer Laban Bosire in the company of police officers.He declared Obura the winner with 24,601 votes, followed by Outa with 13,613. Oloo got 5,090, Richard Ogendo 2,072, Ken Nyagudi 850 and Elphas Oyugi had 87.Oloo was then announced the winner by constituency election panel chairman Bernard Omondi, with 20,998 votes, followed by Ouda, who got 11,960 ,while Obura had 3,287.Ouda&rsquo;s supporters had demanded the party to solve the matter immediately, adding that their candidate&rsquo;s name must be on the ballot.Later, he was given the certificate by Bosire.Oloo ditched the Jubilee Party for ODM in January. After the Jubilee merger, President Uhuru Kenyatta appeared to edge out Oloo after he named Raphael Tuju as the head of his machine.
