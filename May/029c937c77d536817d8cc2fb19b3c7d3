Baringo Senator Gideon Moi will defend his seat against four key nominees on August 8. According to the IEBC list of aspirants, they are Sara Kipng’etich Rono of FPK, Simon Chelugui of Jubilee, Kennedy Ayabei of ODM and Sammy Lokasa of UDM. There is no independent. The main fight, however, will be between Gideon and Chelugui, though the other aspirants have promised to carry out intensive campaigns. Deputy President William Ruto is expected to play a major role in the campaigns. But Moi has warned his supporters against being tricked into “castrating your own bull”, while communities such as the Nandi and Kipsigis keep theirs. He has taken issue with Ruto’s support for Chelugui, a former director of the Betting Control and Licensing Board. “I have shelved all my interests to support Jubilee. I have not bothered about the DP’s position, does he think I don’t want [the seat]? Why does he bother so much about my small seat?” Moi asked. He spoke on his home turf of Kambi Moi, Eldama Ravine, last weekend, when he launched his campaign. Moi said he only needs a second and final term and after the August 8 election, the people will not see him “forever putting up posters around” seeking their support. Chelugui, however, insists he is his own man and his campaign is based on issues the people want tackled.
