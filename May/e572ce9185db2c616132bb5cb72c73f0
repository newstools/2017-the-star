Samuel Abisai, the winner of the Sh221 million SportPesa jackpot, was yesterday treated to a Limousine ride and a red carpet ceremony.The 28-year-old salesman won the betting firm&rsquo;s biggest payout in African history.Abisai lives with his elder sister in a two-bedroomed house behind Thika Road Mall on Thika Road in Nairobi. He was picked up in a white stretch limousine and taken to Carnivore Restaurant where he was handed his cheque.At the restaurant, a red-carpet ceremony was held in honour of the man who correctly predicted all 17 games.Abisai said though the good news of winning the bet was yet to sink in his mind, he was happy that his life was taking a new shape.&ldquo;When SportPesa CEO Ronald Karauri called me in the middle of Sunday night, I was so happy that I stood outside a petrol station jumping up and down,&rdquo; he said. Abisai said he kept the news to himself until Monday when he shared with his sister who broke the news to the entire family.&ldquo;As I stand here today my father and mother are still in disbelief. My sister and elder brother are here with me to witness the news,&rdquo; he said.Abisai had placed Sh200 on two mega jackpot picks of Sh100 each.&ldquo;I predicted the results for the French top-flight Ligue 1 clash between Dijon FCO and Bordeaux which ended 0-0 as I had predicted,&rdquo; he said.In a statement today, the betting firm said this was the first mega jackpot since September last year when they announced the winner of the previous bet. Abisai had to drop his first choice of studying economics when he joined the University of Nairobi despite qualifying for it. &ldquo;This was to increase my chances of getting a job so that he could help his family out of poverty,&rdquo; he said.The lucky man hails from Lurambi in Kakamega county and has eight sisters and four brothers. He said in December last year he won another jackpot of Sh30,000. &ldquo;I was introduced to betting by my elder brother Jacob after I finished campus,&rdquo; he said.
