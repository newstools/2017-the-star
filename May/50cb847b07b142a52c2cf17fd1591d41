Kenyan rapper Khaligraph Jones is still trending after allegations that he had bleached his skin surfaced, but he hasn't really confirmed or denied the allegations.Away from the criticism, there are some local celebrities and artistes who have been supporting Khaligraph Jones, and professing their love for his music, and one of those happens to be TV queen Lilian Muli.The stunning news anchor is apparently a huge fan of Khaligraph Jones, and with all the bleaching rumours going round, she couldn't help but show her support for the music star, by sharing one of the photos where he seems to have bleached, with a caption of lyrics from one of his tracks."Nakumbuka zile siku nilikua nakula kwa vibanda. Ku doze tu kwenye simiti hata Sikua na kitanda. They told me niwache usanii juu apo ni kama na blunder. But hao ndio sasa hunisho, manze izo ngoma zinabamba, man! I wanna thank the fans. They told me that hate can never break a man. So all of this talk about this and that azinibabaiashi..."Lilian Muli then ends the inspiring lyrics by telling fans to stop trolling people and encouraging Khaligraph Jones to do what pleases him; "Enough said keep doing you. 'Respect the OGs'. Stop trolling people."
