The IEBC on Monday lost the first round of a legal battle to NASA in a case involving the hiring of returning officers (see Page 12). Judge George Odunga dismissed the IEBC plea seeking to have the matter knocked out on technicalities, without delving into its substance. While it is true that the IEBC is an independent commission entitled to appoint whomever it wants as returning officers, and NASA’s case is mostly of nuisance value and delay, it is important the electoral agency consults all sides in the August 8 General Election. The Chebukati-Chiloba team at the IEBC has so far been the most proactive set of electoral commissioners that Kenyans have seen in the run-up to a general election. Today’s meeting of the IEBC commissioners and the presidential candidates is important and appropriate, as it will serve to keep everyone in the picture. In doing so, it will avoid the suspicion of previous general elections preparations, when the impression was often created that the ruling party of the day was given special treatment.
