Coast Water Services Board CEO Jacob Kimutai has promised to improve services and end perennial shortages. He said the level of water coverage is below average. Kimutai denied claims the board plans to increase levies. He said the process of increasing levies “is tedious”. “First, there has to be application to the regulator. The tariff will be studied, compiled and taken back to the regulator. It will then be brought to the public for scrutiny,” he said. Kimutai added that new rates have to be justified before they can be gazetted. He said they don’t intend to make profit, but rather recover operation costs and the service development loan. “We need cash to develop infrastructure,” he said.
