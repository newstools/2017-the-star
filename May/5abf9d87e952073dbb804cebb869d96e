The UK government and police have reacted with anger after a US newspaper published photos apparently showing the scene of the Manchester bomb attack.Counter-terror police chiefs said the leak undermined their investigation and victims' and witnesses' confidence.A Whitehall source added: "We are furious. This is completely unacceptable."Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said he had raised the leaks with the US ambassador.Earlier UK Home Secretary Amber Rudd said she was irritated with the US for releasing information about bomber Salman Abedi.Ms Rudd said she had told Washington "it should not happen again".But the New York Times then published photos it says were gathered by UK authorities at the scene of the attack, including the remnants of a backpack, nuts and screws, and a device identified as a "possible detonator".The paper said the alleged evidence suggested "a powerful, high-velocity charge, and a bomb in which its shrapnel was carefully and evenly packed".The photos were subsequently published in the UK media.
