Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto has accused the Jubilee administration of failing to address the rising cost of living. Kenyans are suffering as they find it difficult to afford basic needs, he said on Saturday in Narok West.&ldquo;We need to immediately address the rising cost of living. The present environment created by the high cost of living cannot allow people to be productive and the government should reduce tax. With the inflation rate reaching an all-time high, those hit hardest are low-income Kenyans,&rdquo; Rutto said.
