A relative last seen with Kapsoya MCA aspirant James Ratemo's three children will be charged with killing them. Clifford Nyamweya aged six, five-year-old Dan Nyamweya and Glen Ongaki aged three were reported missing last Saturday. Their uncle Enock Onsanze has been termed the prime suspect. A witness said Onsanze was seen with the children in Eldoret town, moments after they were abducted on their way to Eldovil SDA Church. He is said to have bought them chips, their last meal before their bodies were found dumped in River Nzoia.

He was arrested and charged with abduction," he said. Mutunga said they had crucial leads that will see other suspects arrested. Initial investigations pointed to a family dispute and the deputy commander said they had not established a political motive. The children's mother, Ebby Esaji, said Onsanze sent her a message threatening her over marrying into a difference tribe. “In the text message, he told me I had a short time to return their wealth because women are not allowed to have a share of it,” she said. Mutunga said postmortems will establish how the children were killed. Initial findings indicated they were tortured, their fingers chopped off, eyes gouged out and their throats slit open before their bodies were dumped in the river, more than 60 kilometres from their home. “We all condemn this incident because children should never be part of disputes. We will work round the clock to arrest all those involved," said Mutunga. MPs Oscar Sudi ( and Alfred Keter (Nandi Hills) visitedRatemo's home and urged police to quicken their probe. “We demand a speedy probe into the incident that has caused panic among all parents in Kenya. People are now living in fear and locking their children up in houses out of fear," Keter said.
