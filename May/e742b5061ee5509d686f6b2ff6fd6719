Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua has cautioned Kenyans against six piece voting in the August elections.She said there is need for citizens to vote in leaders based on their ideologies, not on the popularity of parties.Karua said the country will only make strides in development, if those elected concentrate their energies on delivering to the people, not amassing wealth.She spoke in Kisii county, where she drummed up support for candidates seeking election on the party&rsquo;s ticket on Friday. Karua also campaigned for the reelection of President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto.&ldquo;Uhuru and Ruto deserve reelection because they have a clear agenda for this country,&rdquo; she said.Kenyans, Karua said, should not expect an angel to govern them.She urged voters to weigh all those seeking the presidency seat before making a decision. &ldquo;Kenyans should vote in leaders based on their policies, not empty rhetoric,&rdquo; Karua said.She said the opposition is busy castigating the Jubilee administration, instead of selling their agenda to Kenyans.Karua visited South Mugirango, Nyaribari Chache and Nyaribari Masaba constituencies.The Narc Kenya leader told Kenyans to understand the roles played by the national and county governments, before apportioning blame.She said many governors heading county governments do not understand their roles.Karua said most of them have been unable to address challenges facing the health, agriculture and water sectors. &ldquo;Some of the major roles of the national government is to protect property and the lives of Kenyans,&rdquo; she said.In March, Karua told Jubilee to expect &ldquo;friendly fire&rdquo; as her party prepares to field candidates even in its strongholds. She said her party will field candidates for all elective posts other than that of the presidency.Karua said Narc Kenya is growing and they are determined to take over from the grassroots.Karua, who ran for presidency in 2013, will run for Kirinyaga governor. Kirinyaga Central MP Joseph Gitari will be her running mate in the race for the county&rsquo;s top seat.She and Anne Waiguru of Jubilee Party are in the contest to remove incumbent Joseph Ndathi. Political analysts say the Karua-Gitari ticket has complicated the equation for Waiguru. It is also a fact they will use the NYS scam against their rival in their campaigns.
