Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya has dismissed the Senate&rsquo;s push to have him barred from seeking reelection.Speaking at Eshisiru Centre in Lurambi on Friday, Oparanya said the Senate has no power to bar any candidate.The Senate Public Accounts and Investments Committee on Thursday said Oparanya should be arrested for snubbing its summons to appear before it and answer audit queries.The governor said he will never appear before the Senate as long as Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale is still a member. Oparanya added that &ldquo;the Senate does not know what it is doing. If they want to strangle me let them go ahead&rdquo;.What you are hearing in the media that I will not be allowed to contest the August election is all but lies. I am going to Nairobi today and that is where the police headquarters are. Let them arrest me if they can.&rdquo; The governor went on, &ldquo;Khalwale knows I will beat him and he has taken the polling station to the Senate, which does not vote. Let him face me, no institution can stop anyone from contesting.&rdquo;
