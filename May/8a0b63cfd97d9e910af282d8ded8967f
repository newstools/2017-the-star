Some Kenyans on Twitter have taken issue with the fact that Citizen TV news anchor Willis Raburu decided to settle down with one Michelle Ngami, a lady who hails from the Kikuyu ethnic community.A day after their colourful nuptials, Raburu, who dabbles as the host of the 10 over 10 show, shared a photo of the beautiful Ngami on his social media pages.While some of his fans congratulated him for the bold move, others told him that he has just landed in hot soup, without mincing their words.Reactions include:Eleanor Martin: Ngoja ukamuliwe uishe wacha vile umenona hapo, you'll soon be like Eric Omondi.Philip Odongo: Kwani ni Mkikuyu tena? Kwisha wewe.Jane Mutua: Kidogo kidogo utaona kwa headlines ati Citizen TV journalist found...haiya.
