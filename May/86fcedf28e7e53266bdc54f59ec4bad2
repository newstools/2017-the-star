The Independent Policing Oversight Authority is investigating an incident in which police are accused of lobbing teargas at a family in Komarock on Sunday and arresting three men.IPOA spokesman Dennis Oketch said investigators are searching for witnesses to gather evidence on the &ldquo;direct matter&rdquo; and the probe is expected to take a short time.&ldquo;We picked up the case from social and mainstream media and we have already dispatched our team to begin the investigations,&rdquo; he said.It is alleged that officers from Kayole police station led by the deputy OCS stormed Pascal Kaleli&rsquo;s home during a get-together, after his neighbour Eva Kaimenyi, believed to be a magistrate, called and ordered the police to arrest everyone in the house.&ldquo;The deputy OCS jumped over the gate, shot in the air twice and ordered other officers to shoot. Two of them lobbed teargas through the windows into where relatives and friends sat,&rdquo; Kaleli said.Cops teargas pregnant woman, kidsKaleli&rsquo;s brother Keith, his pregnant wife and two children aged nine months and two years, and friends were inside the house when the teargas canisters burst into fumes.&ldquo;Keith sprinted out of the house and told police the teargas had made his wife faint but he was bundled into the police vehicle. I was also hauled into the car with Mwau and they drove with us,&rdquo; Kaleli told the Star.He said they were beaten up and locked up at the police station overnight and released on Monday.But Kayole OCPD Joseph Gichangi said officers on patrol responded to a distress call after Kaimenyi sought help over disturbance from Kaleli&rsquo;s home.Gichangi said Kaleli declined to open to police after a neighbour complained of noise from Kaleli&rsquo;s house.&ldquo;When eventually the gate was opened, one of the men inside jumped at the officer and bit his finger and a commotion ensued. It is during this commotion that one of the officers fired the teargas,&rdquo; Gichangi said.He said the three have not complained of being beaten up and any such complaint will be investigated. The police boss did not, however, explain how Kaimenyi made a distress call or how police heard it, as her house is about 100 metres away.Kaimenyi had complained of noise from Kaleli&rsquo;s house but other neighbours disputed the allegations.She allegedly banged Kaleli&rsquo;s gate and told him that whatever was happening should stop and everyone should leave.Family says there was no noiseThe two did not agree after Kaleli maintained there was no noise from his house and Kaimenyi, said to be a daughter of Lands CS Jacob Kaimenyi, swore to teach him and his visitors a lesson.Police are planning to charge them with causing a disturbance.But the three have instructed their lawyer to sue the IG Joseph Boinet for malicious and unlawful arrest, detention and assault, demanding compensation for injuries and property destroyed by police.
