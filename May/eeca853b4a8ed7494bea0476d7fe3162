Open defecation in most parts of Kajiado county is not frowned on. Moreover, some taboos hold that a parent cannot share a latrine or mix his or her excreta with the children&rsquo;s.It is for these reasons that some communities in Kajiado do not accept the use of conventional toilets.In areas where government health officials have come up with strict policies against families that have failed to put up pit latrines, some families build them to appease the authorities but never step in them.CULTURAL RESISTANCEMashuuru resident Musa Leina is a good example of people who had sworn never to mix his stool with those of his children. But after many months of convincing from the local health officials, he allowed his wife to build a toilet.His wife Recho, using the little money she borrowed from the local village sacco, constructed a temporary toilet without a roof, which she continued to use with her children.All this time, her husband Leina continued to relieve himself in the nearby bushes, until one time when he was attacked by the malaria virus.He could not walk to the nearest bushes because he had been weakened by acute diarrhoea, and so his wife forced him to use the family toilet.After he healed, Leina never turned back. He is now a respected village elder on the list of &lsquo;advanced&rsquo; villagers with toilets in their homes.Several NGOs in Kajiado, led by Neighbours Initiative Alliance (NIA), have come together to help the Kajiado government educate the villagers on the importance of using modern toilets.NIA programme manager Samuel Jakinda said water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) are important in managing diseases.He said Kenya is classified as a chronically water-scarce country and that accessing WASH varies greatly, with ASAL areas such as Kajiado being the most affected.&ldquo;When we started this programme of teaching villagers on the use of pit latrines, we encountered a lot of resistance. The local elders viewed it negatively,&rdquo; Jakinda said.He said his organisation had to partner with the county government and the provincial administration.The chiefs, he said, played a major role in convincing residents to build toilets.&ldquo;In some cases, we could visit homes with pit latrines which are not used. They would say the toilets they built are for the government or local health official who forced them to build. In that case, after building a pit latrine, they will continue to relieve themselves in the bushes,&rdquo; Jakinda said.GLOBAL PROBLEMToday, most families with pit latrines are a happy lot. They remain the face of development in the remotest areas of Mashuuru.Most of the homes we visited have even advanced further by constructing several sets of pit latrines for their families.In one home, we found that the owners have constructed three toilets &mdash; for their children, father and mother &mdash; and another one for their guests.The stench associated with pit latrines is not there in the villages, because the people have been trained on the use of ashes, which they pour into the pits to kill bacteria.Because they do not use water, the excreta dry up in the pits, says Sophia Setian, a health official in Kajiado.Setian said water is a major problem in the county, with 65 per cent of residents using boreholes, which become contaminated during the rainy season as a result of people using bushes.According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), poor sanitation is a pressing problem in many countries. More than 40 per cent of the world&rsquo;s populations, approximately 2.5 billion people, have no access to improved sanitation.An estimated 1.8 million people die each year from diarrhoea, mostly related to poor sanitation, while 5,500 children worldwide die every day from diseases caused by contaminated food and water.In Kenya, nearly 6 million people lack access to toilets and therefore defecate in the open, encouraging the spread of diseases.Open defecation refers to the practice where people relieve themselves in fields, bushes, forests, water bodies or other open spaces.Interestingly, some of the most common reasons for persons &lsquo;going outside&rsquo; rather than using latrines or toilets include collapse of the facilities, difficulty in their use especially by the elderly and/or children, shared facilities or if they are located far away.OLD HABITS DIE HARDSome counties have unacceptably high open defecation rates.In Kajiado county, where open defecation rates are above 40 per cent, according to Health chief officer Frida Tait, 26 villages out of 1,172 villages have been declared open defecation-free.While awarding two villages with certificates of open defecation free in Mashuuru on Friday, Tait said behaviour change among the Maasai communities towards accepting to use toilets is highly desired.Most of the elderly people prefer helping themselves in the bushes rather that mixing their excreta with their daughters and sons.Others say constructed toilets are &ldquo;uncomfortable&rdquo; because of high temperatures in the semi-arid county, which experiences acute water shortage around the year.During the ceremony, Tait said: &ldquo;We need to increase awareness on environmental health and promote hygienic practices like proper use of latrines and hand washing to reduce disease transmission.&rdquo;Tait said trachoma is the leading infectious cause of blindness in the world, and that it is commonly found in cultural groups with poor hygiene.She said trachoma control includes surgery, antibiotics, facial cleanliness and environmental improvement (SAFE).The Health chief officer said potentially blinding and active trachoma are monitored using trachomatous trichiasis (TT) in adults and trachoma inflammation-follicular (TF) in children aged 1&ndash;9 years.HAVEN FOR INFECTIONSTait urged the Maasai communities in the rural Kajiado to accept new conventional methods of maintaining hygiene to reduce medical expenses.She said poor hygiene habits create a haven for avoidable infections, citing failure to wash faces and bathe regularly, sharing of water basins and towels for face washing, traditional methods of trachoma treatment and dirty household environment.Tait said some years back, due to socio-cultural perceptions, toilets were unacceptable and use of bushes for human waste disposal was common.Poor perceptions on disease susceptibility, flies on children&rsquo;s faces, latrine ownership and usage and separation of human and animal dwellings also played a role in the transmission of trachoma.Fear of loss of sight during surgery was a deterrent to its uptake and a desire to be able to see and take care of domestic animals promoted surgery uptake among the Kajiado Maasai, according to local health officials.Poor practices and related socio-cultural perceptions are important risk factors in sustaining trachoma infection and transmission.Tait said community members require health education for behaviour change and awareness creation about surgery.She said residents in 15 counties are courting health risks by having open defecation rates above 40 per cent, according to a recent study done in the 47 counties.Tait said eliminating open defecation would require approximately 1.2 million latrines to be built in Kenya and properly used.Nomadism, according to health research reports, is also found to contribute to high open defecation rates, with Kajiado and Narok counties at 45.5 per cent and 50.3 per cent respectively.&ldquo;The economic mainstay of pastoralists is raising livestock. They tend to move with their animals in search of water and pasture. As they move with their animals they rarely carry mobile toilets along, tending rather to defecate in the open,&rdquo; Tait said.Research reports, according to Tait, state that the poorest in Kenya are 270 times more likely to practise open defecation than the richest, and estimates that about 5.6 million Kenyans defecate in the open.Health experts warn that this practice is a fertile ground for the transmission for water-borne diseases like diarrhoea and parasitic worms.The WHO expresses concern that this is a global sanitation crisis practiced by one billion people. Closer home, a 2014 report on sanitation audit shows that poor sanitation represents one of the biggest development challenges and costs Kenya Sh27 billion, with many people in rural areas practising open defecation (15 per cent) compared to urban areas (3 per cent).Kajiado Governor David Nkedianye, in many of his public meetings in the rural areas, has been urging residents to stop using bushes to defecate and build toilets to avoid the spread of contagious diseases.Recently in Loitokitok, Nkedianye revealed that latrine coverage in Kajiado was at 44 per cent, with the rest of the households defecating in the bushes.The governor said a high number of deaths is caused by communicable diseases like diarrhoea, cholera, typhoid and amoeba due to lack of toilets.&ldquo;Diarrhoea is the second most common cause of death of children under the age of five in developing countries. Most of such cases are caused by food or water contaminated by harmful waste,&rdquo; he said.The campaigns being carried out in rural Kajiado are aimed at raising awareness on the urgency to end open defecation, especially for women and girls who are particularly vulnerable to sexual violence due to lack of privacy.&ldquo;One in three women risks shame, disease and harassment because they have nowhere safe to go and access a toilet. We must act now. This must stop and the only way is by building latrines in every homestead,&rdquo; Nkedianye said.He said those defecating in the bush will be punished, urging chiefs to ensure that every household has proper toilet and sanitation facilities.
