ODM Taita Taveta governor candidate Thomas Mwadeghu has given incumbent John Mruttu&rsquo;s administration a 30 per cent rating in its performance.Speaking on a local FM station yesterday, Mwadeghu who is also the Wundanyi MP, said Mruttu appointed the wrong people to work with him.&ldquo;His officers were mediocre people who had been picked from cities and had no development agenda for the region. Most of them came to loot public funds. Some of them were approved by the assembly, yet they lacked the required education qualifications,&rdquo; he said.Mwadeghu said Mruttu failed to crack the whip on his officers, despite continued &ldquo;massive corruption&rdquo; in the county government.He alleged Senator Dan Mwazo did not question corruption in the county government because &ldquo;he wanted Mruttu to fail.&rdquo;&ldquo;At one time, Senator Mwazo came to my office and I asked him why he was silent about the corruption in the county and he told me we should keep quiet and let Mruttu fail so we could have it easy ousting him,&rdquo; Mwadeghu said.He said he expected to floor Mruttu during the ODM party nominations.&ldquo;How did Mruttu expect to win the nominations if he did not vote for himself?&rdquo; Mwadeghu said.He said Mruttu had the backing of aspirants from other parties, but he still beat him.
