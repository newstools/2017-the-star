Former Interior PS Mutea Iringo is among Jubilee Party's 15 nominated candidates for the East Africa Legislative Assembly.The EALA is an organ of the East African Community and has a wide-ranging mandate on top of being the legislative organ of the community.National Assembly Majority leader and Garissa Town MP Aden Duale sent a letter on this on May 11, to Michael Sialai who is the National Assembly's clerk."I enclose herewith the prescribed form duly completed and endorsed as required together with other necessary documentations," he said.Also nominated are Charles Mochama (Nyamira), Joe Muriuki (Kiambu), Eunice Karanja (Trans Nzoia), Abubakar Ogle (Wajir), Adan Mohammed (Mandera) and former Kamukunji MP Simon Mbugua (Nairobi).Others are Irene Masit (Elgeyo Marakwet), Justin Nthiiri (Tharaka Nithi), Nelson Dzuya (Kilifi), Canon Waqo (Marsabit), Chepkemoi Stacey (Bomet), Florence Sergon (Baringo), Justus Mate (Embu) and Pius Ewoton (Turkana).Duale vowed that they would shoot down the nomination of opposition candidates.&ldquo;I assure the son of Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper) and the brother of Raila Odinga (ODM) that, despite their political parties each having a slot in the EALA, I will lead members from both sides of the House to reject them,&rdquo; Duale told the Star.A storm erupted in both Wiper and ODM, following applications for the nomination of Kalonzo's firstborn son and Raila&rsquo;s elder brother to the EALA.Nominated MP Oburu Odinga later said he quit the race to focus on campaigns for NASA flag bearer Raila Odinga.Read: I declined EALA slot to campaign for Raila, says OburuDr Temi Mutia, immediate former Wiper Executive Director and Deputy Head of NASA secretariat, and Ahmed Ibrahim are among Wiper EALA applicants.ODM front runners are National Elections Board chairperson Judith Pareno and Raila's long-term think- tank member Abubakar Zein, both of whom are seeking a second term.Nancy Abisae, who was among ODM&rsquo;s 2012 nominees, is unlikely to get her job back.Wiper and ODM are the two major National Super Alliance affiliate parties. It is believed that Kalonzo is positioning his son for presidential succession politics, especially if NASA is vanquished by President Uhuru Kenyatta at the August 8 election.More on this: Storm in NASA as Kalonzo son, Oburu nominated to EALA
