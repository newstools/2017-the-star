Independent presidential candidate Nixon Kukubo has exuded confidence he will win in August, saying he will hand President Uhuru a &ldquo;humiliating defeat&rdquo;.Kukubo, who vied in the 2007 General Election against President Mwai Kibaki but lost, said Uhuru will go down in history as a one-term head of state.At the 2007 polls, Kukubo only garnered 5,927 votes.Speaking to the Star in Webuye town yesterday, he said the Jubilee administration&rsquo;s poor performance and the skyrocketing prices of essential commodities will drive Kenyans to choose a better leader.Kukubo urged voters not to be swayed by party and tribal affiliations.&ldquo;Kenyans have seen what party euphoria and political ethnicity have done to the country. Uhuru should prepare for a humiliating defeat from me,&rdquo; he said.Asked about his poor performance in the 2007 election, Kukubo said the polls were not free and fair and even international agencies disputed the results.He also castigated NASA, saying the alliance is no different from Jubilee.&ldquo;The difference between the politicians in NASA and Jubilee is the same. Kenyans should not be deceived into voting for either,&rdquo; Kukubo said.The former KDF soldier warned the Luhya community against being duped the NASA lineup has included their own.He said Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula and ANC&rsquo;s Musalia Mudavadi are strangers in the alliance.&ldquo;Mudavadi and Musalia have proved they are political brokers, who are only using the Luhya community for their personal interests,&rdquo; Kukubo said.He said opting out of the race in support of ODM leader Raila Odinga, indicated they have no ambitions to lead this country and they only want to stay close to power.Kukubo also criticised Wetang&rsquo;ula&rsquo;s move to defend the Bungoma Senate seat, saying he wasted his supporters time, who thought he had moved to national politics.He said he will roll out campaigns starting this Friday.Kukubo said he is scheduled to meet like-minded independent candidates.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m receiving overwhelming support from independent candidates, who don&rsquo;t subscribe to party politics,&rdquo; he said.Kukubo said the primaries indicated that all major political parties had no capacity to run this country.There are 11 presidential candidates who have registered to run as independents.
