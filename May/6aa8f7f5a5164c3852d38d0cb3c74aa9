Nyeri nurses have finally called off their three-week strike after the county government agreed to address some of their grievances.The announcement was made yesterday in a joint press conference involving Governor Samuel Wamathai and Kenya National Union of Nurses&rsquo; county officials.They demanded their promotions be effected. They also wanted more nurses hired to address a shortfall of more than 200 nurses in all county health facilities.Wamathai said the county has addressed the issues raised and expects the nurses to resume work and serve the people.He apologised to Nyeri residents for the suffering they have undergone during the strike.KNUN branch secretary general Beatrice Nduati said 438 nurses out of the 479 have been issued promotion letters.She said the remaining nurses will be promoted once they are vetted. Nduati said she is hopeful this will be done soon.Sixty-five nurses were also issued employment letters, but Nduati said more need to get contracts. &ldquo;Our employer has shown willingness to address our grievances through this gesture. We are now hoping that more will be done to avoid such instances in future where delivery of health services is affected by a strike,&rdquo; she said.Wamathai promised to work with nurses and said no one will be victimised.Health services were disrupted when the nurses went on strike. They had issued a strike notice on April 6. In March, Nduati had said the county government had ignored numerous appeals.She said none of the KNUN members had been promoted for four years, adding they were not ready to resume work until their grievances were addressed.
