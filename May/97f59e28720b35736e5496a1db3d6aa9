The Jubilee Party will win the Nairobi governor post and has a team that understands and will address the problems that city residents face, Deputy President William Ruto has said.He spoke to residents on Wednesday mat the Nairobi Retail Market (Markiti) and Eastleigh grounds.The DP was with National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale, Deputy Speaker Joyce Laboso, Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko, nominated Senator Beatrice Elachi and MPs Johnstone Sakaja (nominated), Cecily Mbarire (Runyenjes) and Yusuf Hassan (Kamukunji).Ruto said the current leaders do not understand the city and do not know how to solve the people&rsquo;s problems."Between Governor Evans Kidero and Mike Sonko, who understands the issues of Nairobi better?" he said.&ldquo;Jubilee has leaders who understand the problems facing the people and have the interest of the people at heart.&rdquo;The Deputy President said the opposition is banking on tribal politics to succeed during the August elections, but Kenyans are more enlightened and will elect development-conscious leaders irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds.Ruto said Jubilee was committed to politics aimed at uniting the people irrespective of their ethnic, religious or political backgrounds.He said the next election will not be about propaganda and lies, but development-related matters.Jubilee has implemented its development agenda across the country unlike the opposition leaders who have nothing to show when they served in senior positions in previous regimes, Ruto said.Sonko, the Jubilee nominee for governor, said he wants to restore sanity in the city to allow businesses to thrive.He said the party has a plan on how to capture all the seats in the county currently held by opposition leaders.&ldquo;The days of council askaris harassing traders will be a thing of the past. My administration will focus on encouraging businesspeople, not harassing them,&rdquo; Sonko said.Duale said opposition leaders have sensed defeat and that is why they are threatening to boycott the August 8 election.NASA has threatened to boycott polls over teh IEBC's appeal against having Presidential election announced at teh constituency level being final. The commission wants its chairman to announce the results.The Constitution does not give powers to returning officers at the constituency level to announce the Presidential results, and only the IEBC chairman has the powers to do so, Duale said.&ldquo;Those in the opposition want the ROs to have a final say on the presidential results at the constituency so they can manipulate them in their strongholds,&rdquo; he said.
