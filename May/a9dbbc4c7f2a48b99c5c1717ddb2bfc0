Homa Bay Senator Moses Kajwang&rsquo; (pictured) on Monday met residents who rejected his call for the six-piece voting pattern.The senator had gone to visit traders whose shops were razed by fire last Saturday morning.He was cleared by county IEBC returning officer Maurice Kosgei to defend his seat on the ODM ticket.Drama began when Kajwang&rsquo; tried to narrate how he saw NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga being cleared to run for the presidency on Sunday.He said Raila had the best suit, &ldquo;which shows the voting style his supporters should follow&rdquo;.&ldquo;Yesterday [on Sunday] you saw how Jakom [Raila] was smart. He had a tie, coat, long trousers, socks and shoes. The suit signified what he wants in Homa Bay,&rdquo; Kajwang&rsquo; said. The senator said it would be wrong for residents to vote for Raila as President and not pick those who could help him run his government. &ldquo;My request is that as you vote for Raila on that day. Remember his foot soldiers because that&rsquo;s how he will be a strong President,&rdquo; Kajwang&rsquo; said. The residents told Kajwang&rsquo; to focus on campaigning for himself and stop bringing up other candidates. He stopped talking for a moment until the crowd calmed down.
