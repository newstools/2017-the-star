I will correct the mess created by the Wajir government if you elect me, governor aspirant Ambassador Mohamud Abdi has promised county residents.Abdi, who will run on the Jubilee ticket, said he will form an all-inclusive government.He said he corrected the mistakes he made at the March 4 2013 General Election, which made him lose to incumbent Ahmed Abdullahi. &ldquo;This time we are sure of victory. God willing the people of Wajir will have leaders they can trust with their resources, and who can deliver,&rdquo; he said.Abdi spoke in Wajir town on Saturday, two days after unveiling Ahmed Mukhtar, his running mate, at a Nairobi hotel.The governor aspirant said the current administration has done little to ensure equitable distribution of resources among the community.He said if he wins, development funds will be distributed fairly in the county&rsquo;s 30 wards, and residents will be allowed to participate in the implementation of county projects.Abdi said he picked Mukhtar, 32, because youths comprise most of the population, and as a young, energetic and educated person he will push their agenda.The governor aspirant&rsquo;s lineup includes Abdullahi Ali, running for senator, and Halima Abdille for woman representative. Abdi said he is confident JP will sweep all the seats in the county, and urged the electorate to vote for his team.Speaking at the same function, Muhtar said initially he wanted to contest for the Wajir South parliamentary seat, but was prevailed upon by elders to join Abdi&rsquo;s camp, &ldquo;the winning team&rdquo;.&ldquo;We are all united and have one agenda: to remove the current administration, which has brainwashed our people and enslaved them into believing there is a future for them under the current governor,&rdquo; the running mate said.Mukhtar cited inefficiencies and financial mismanagement in Abdullahi&rsquo;s government. He said it will take them one year to fix the problems created by the administration.
