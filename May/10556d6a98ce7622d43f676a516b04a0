The standard gauge railway is Kenya’s largest single development project
since Independence. It may be overpriced at Sh350 billion so far, but it has
great potential to be the long awaited game-changer for the economy. However, cost notwithstanding, if implemented properly, the SGR could
revolutionise the movement of people and goods from Mombasa to upcountry and
the eastern African hinterland. The SGR’s viability remains to be seen, but if it goes according to plan it
will open up the country and the region like never before. In terms of tourism
alone, for instance, it will connect the Coast and the Maasai Mara to Kisumu. A
daylong trip from the Coast via the Tsavo and Nairobi National Park as well as
the Maasai Mara to Lake Victoria would be a new and very popular circuit with
tourists. The iconic stations could give rise to entrepreneur hubs along the 900km
eventual route. If done in the right
way, the SGR will drive growth and development for decades to come.
