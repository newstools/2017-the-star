NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga will get Migori votes but should let residents to pick their preferred candidates in other elective posts to prevent voter apathy on August 8.Two leaders yesterday said Raila&rsquo;s calls for a six-piece voting pattern for ODM and his support of party-affiliated candidates will divide residents and cause apathy, which will affect his votes.Following the bungled party primaries, most voters will elect individuals, not parties, Migori Ford Kenya chairman Samuel Migore and ODM chairman Philip Makabong&rsquo;o separately told the Star.The six-piece vote pattern is where voters select candidates from only one party that they support. They vote for the party, and not individuals.Speaking to journalists in Migori town, Migore said they have differed with Raila and other NASA co-principals over the six-piece vote.&ldquo;Migori is past the era of leaders being imposed on them. We are sure of working closely to deliver the presidential vote, but for the sake of unity other seats will be locally decided,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;NASA principals should stand with independent candidates who were in party primaries, otherwise they will lose out in presidential votes as most have voting blocs to boost.&rdquo;Makabong&rsquo;o said NASA parties should be blamed for the bungled nominations and should not ignore independent candidates. &ldquo;Migori, unlike other Nyanza counties, is cosmopolitan, which makes imposing of the six-piece to be impossible,&rdquo; he warned.Makabong&rsquo;o and county ODM youth leader Eric Opany have led local party officials to openly support former Rongo MP Ochillo Ayacko, an independent candidate for governor. Incumbent Okoth Obado is the ODM nominee.
