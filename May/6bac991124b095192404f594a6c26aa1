Kisii University vice chancellor John Akama has said Ekegusii language, culture and history are endangered.The language will become extinct in the next 40 years due to declining number of users.To save the language from a natural death, there is need for parents to encourage their children to use it at home.Apart from Ekegusii, the Suba community&rsquo;s language also faces threat of extinction.&ldquo;It is saddening that the Ekegusii language will become extinct,&rdquo; Akama said.The VC spoke at the university on Wednesday during the launch of his book - The Gusii of Kenya.The book touches on the social, economic, culture, political and judicial perspectives of the community.It also discusses historical aspects of the Gusiis and how they occupied their present land. Gusii oral tradition contains a number of prominent figures linked with historical events, especially migrations into the current homeland and the arrival of the British.Akama&rsquo;s wife Marion, Prof Michael Ntabo, who is the dean, School of Arts Rongo University, Prof Fredrick Wanyama, Prof Nyachieo Bogonko, Prof Benjamin Ondigi and Dr Herman Kiriama attended the launch.Akama said lack of documentations on cultural values by ethnic communities has made many people adopt contemporary lifestyles, undermining African culture.&ldquo;I urge communities to document their cultural values because the same will have impact on the youths who are now embracing modern culture,&rsquo; the VC said.&ldquo;We are facing challenges of documenting the same because of philosophical approach.&rdquo; Ntabo, who was also the guest of honour, praised Akama for writing the book, saying it touches on important aspects of the Gusii community.&ldquo;It is going to help people think big,&rdquo; Ntabo said.Akama urged parents to assist teachers inculcate reading culture in their children because knowledge will empower them.The vice chancellor said it is sad that some standard eight pupils cannot solve class two arithmetics. In 2012, a former civil servant launched books on the Kisii culture. Joseph Mandi was born in Kisii in 1936, and worked in several parastatals including the Kenya Tea Development Authority. He was the chief technical officer at KTDA, which has already been privatised. Later, he served as an agricultural manager at Nzoia Sugar Company. After retiring in 1994, he embarked on a massive project to write a book on Kisii culture. The fruits of his hardwork were seen at the Serena Hotel when he launched two books: Chingencho Chi&rsquo;Ekegusii (the ways of the Gusii people) and Chinkwana Chi&rsquo;Ekegusii (proverbs of the Gusii people). The launch of the new books published by Carole Mandi Media was presided by former ICT Permanent Secretary Dr Bitange Ndemo.
