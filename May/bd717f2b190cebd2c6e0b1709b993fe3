Police have released 24 names and photographs of knife-wielding juvenile criminal gang members blamed for increasing crime in Mombasa.Their identities were released on Thursday after they were profiled and linked to a series of daring robberies and cases of stabbing, especially in Old Town.Mahsia alias Dogo Presso and Mohammed alias Bobocha are among key leaders of the 'Old Town Youth Gang'.The group targets women, children and security agencies and kills at the slightest provocation.A student and a woman were robbed of their valuables and killed in Old Town between March and April."They are very dangerous. You are not guaranteed of safety whether you cooperate or not. It is all at their mercy," said a senior community policing official who did not want to be named.Members of the gang are believed to have started off as football players. Most of them are hooked on drugs and steal to sustain their lavish lifestyles.Police asked the public to help them arrest the criminals as their "ultimate goal is to cause pain and kill".Mombasa police boss Lucas Ogara noted the group is a splinter of 'Wakali Wao', Kiswahili for 'the toughest of them all' and 'Wakali Kweli', which means 'truly tough'. These gangs operate in Kisauni and Likoni.Ogara said they have made great strides in ending the criminals' activities.&ldquo;We have seen a decline in the number of robberies and cases of stabbing in Old Town in the last month. We need public support to completely wipe them out," he said.Kisauni residents said the gang members attack people and hijacks matatus during the day. They walk in groups of about 10-15 members, wielding knives and pangas.Five criminals linked to the Wakali Kwanza gang were shot dead in Mombasa in August last year during an operation aimed at flushing the group out of the county. County commissioner Mohamed Maalim said at that time that police had arrested more than 30 gang members.More on this: Five 'Wakali Kwanza' gangsters shot dead in MombasaAlso read: 17 armed youths arrested in Mombasa, police link them to dreaded gangsYouths have also formed gangs in Nairobi's Eastleigh area.
