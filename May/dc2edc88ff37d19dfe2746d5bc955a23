Coast governors have faulted the process ollowed in the appointment of new Coast Water Services Board CEO Jacob Kimutai. Mombasa’s Hassan Joho, Kilifi’s Amason Kingi and Taita Taveta’s John Mruttu on Wednesday accused the national government of dictating the leadership of the CWSB. “Three applicants Kimutai, Florence Birya and David Birya were successful during the interview by Deloitte and Touche and their names forwarded to the Board,” Kingi said. “Birya was the best from the three interviewed. She was also the only woman, an added advantage, and she is from the Coast region. “However, the Jubilee administration decided that Kimutai, who came third during the interviews, and is not even from the Coast, should be appointed the CEO.” Kimutai replaced Joseph Omwange, who headed the board in an acting capacity for 17 months. Kingi said Kimutai’s appointment was orchestrated by forces within Jubilee’s inner circle. “Why Kimutai? Who is behind his appointment,” he said. Kingi said Kimutai was sacked by his former employer and does not deserve to head the CWSB.
