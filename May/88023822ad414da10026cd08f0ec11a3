Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho was barred on Wednesday from attending President Uhuru Kenyatta's SGR launch in Miritini.Reports indicated security officials kept him off the venue and that he was seen arguing with GSU officers at the Miritini gate while the ceremony went on at Port Reitz. Speaking to The Star by phone, county communications director Richard Chacha said the officials were following "orders from above".On Tuesday, the President told Joho to back off Jubilee projects and focus on his mandate as county boss.Uhuru asked the Governor to concentrate on justifying his re-election to residents."The Governor has been criticising our projects at the Coast. He should focus on completing at least one of his own, such as building dykes or cleaning the city, before he starts looking elsewhere," he said.Joho had demanded that Uhuru account for the extra Sh100 billion for the Standard Gauge Railway before the launch.He accused the President of "oiling the wheels of corruption at the expense of service delivery".More on this: Back off from Jubilee projects, Uhuru tells Joho ahead of SGR cargo train launchAlso read: Account for extra Sh100 billion for SGR or I will stop launch, Joho tells UhuruThe fiery Governor was also barred from the Mtongwe ferry services relaunch in March.
