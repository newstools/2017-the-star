Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga should brace himself for a titanic battle in the race for the governor seat, Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo has said after he was cleared to run as an independent candidate.Speaking to the Star on the phone on Wednesday, Gumbo said he was given the go-ahead after meeting the prerequisite conditions.The MP said he is armed to the teeth to reclaim his stolen victory in the ODM primaries. Gumbo said despite Rasanga coming distant second, he was given the ticket. &ldquo;We cannot afford to leave it to Rasanga. He must pay the price,&rdquo; he said. Gumbo said he is confident he will trounce the incumbent at the August 8 General Election. He claims he garnered 127,000 votes against Rasanga&rsquo;s 70,000. However, the official results announced by Siaya county returning officer Joshua Anyona indicated Rasanga had 143,460 votes and Gumbo 87,460. William Oduol garnered 9,535 votes and Carey Orege was last with 1,908.Gumbo, who is also National Assembly PAC chairman, accused Rasanga of ballot stuffing and intimidating his agents, especially in Alego/Usonga constituency.&ldquo;Voting was deliberately delayed in my strongholds despite the landslide win,&rdquo; Gumbo said. The lawmaker said if he fails to run, it will be a betrayal to the electorate who are yet to enjoy the fruits of devolution.Gumbo said giving Rasanga another term will make residents of Siaya suffer &ldquo;under the jaws of wanton corruption and iron fist leadership&rdquo;.The MP said the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission will separate wheat from chaff in August. He said the Siaya county election officials were allies of Rasanga.
