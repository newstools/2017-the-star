The High Court was urged on Friday to dismiss an application to terminate a case in which Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi (pictured) is charged with forging academic papers and presenting a false declaration before the 2013 election.Prosecutor Fredrick Ashimosi told Justice Hedwig Ong&rsquo;udi that the prosecution has enough evidence to prove Sudi forged his academic papers.But Sudi&rsquo;s lawyer Tom Ojienda asked the court to terminate the charges, as the EACC violated the Constitution by investigating the alleged offence and the DPP acted on an illegal investigation to charge Sudi.The judge will give her ruling on June 14.
