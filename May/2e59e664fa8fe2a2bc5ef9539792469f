Laikipia governor aspirant Nderitu Muriithi (pictured) has denied he called Laikipia North residents baboons.He said that is propaganda from Trade executive Jane Putunoi.&ldquo;Madam Putunoi was my running mate during the 2013 general election. Now she has turned to spreading rumours that I insulted my people. Baboons live in trees but you people are human beings,&rdquo; Muriithi said.He spoke at Doldol on Sunday during a prayer meeting, accompanied by his running mate John Mwaniki. Muriithi congratulated former Foreign Affairs PS Thuita Mwangi, technocrat James Mathenge and Mwangi Woodboy for supporting him after they were defeated in Jubilee Party primaries. Last Monday, the three announced they would back Muriithi to remove Irungu, who was declared the winner by the court and handed the JP certificate.
