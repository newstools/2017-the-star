Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong has said a NASA government is inevitable in Kenya, owing to the many ills that afflict citizens.He spoke at the burial of his father-in-law Albert Onamu in Lumakanda, Kakamega, on Saturday. Ojaamong said the high cost of living has made life unbearable for many Kenyans.&ldquo;There is no money in this Jubilee government. Every activity is executed through external borrowing with the Kenya Revenue Authority taxes used to pay the loans,&rdquo; Ojaamong said.Kenya had external debts of Sh1.7 trillion under President Mwai Kibaki&rsquo;s administration, but the figure has shot to more than Sh7 trillion in four years under President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto.Ojaamong said the UhuRuto administration has not improved Kenyans&rsquo; lives as promised during pre-election campaigns in 2013. The governor appealed to voters to vote for opposition chief Raila Odinga and other leaders who are not swayed by bribes.Ojaamong said Kenyans are living in debt and the flow of funds from the National Treasury to the counties is becoming a pipedream, yet the Constitution recognises the devolved systems of government.
