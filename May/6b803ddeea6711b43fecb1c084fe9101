Only seven per cent of those surveyed said their situations have improved.&ldquo;Most striking, however, is the fact that this overall negative figure is the highest recorded since the last election, the nearest one having been obtained in Ipsos&rsquo; November 2013 SPEC survey, but which was substantially lower (60 percent),&rdquo; Ipsos said.Ironically, a 43 per cent of Kenyans who said their household economic condition had worsened in the past three months still said they would vote for Uhuru.Forty-six percent of the respondents who said their household economic condition had deteriorated said they would vote for Raila.Raila and the NASA brigade have turned hunger, food shortages, high prices and bad economic planning into a major political issue against the Jubilee administration. They promised to lower the cost of living if elected.For the first time in post-independence history, a 2kg packet of unga hit Sh160 but Jubilee has moved in with a subsidy, cutting the price to Sh90.Only 18 per cent said the country is headed in the right direction, nine per cent said Kenya is headed in the neither the right nor the wrong direction and two per cent said they were not sure.In fact, the poll indicates 60 percent of Kenyans believe their general economic conditions for them and their families have worsened compared to five years ago.Only 23 percent said their economic condition had improved over the last five years, while 16 percent said the condition stagnated.Read: Ruto likely to be President before Raila &mdash; Ipsos poll
