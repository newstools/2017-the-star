Anne Waiguru has for the first time claimed that some MPs demanded Sh10 million to clear her in the Sh1.8 billion scandal at the National Youth Service.Parliament's Public Accounts Committee recently released a report recommending that Waiguru be barred from holding public office over the scam. But Waiguru said during an interview on Citizen TV Wednesday night that PAC members asked for the bribe so that they would write a favorable report."Sometimes, some PAC members would ask for money, so they can write a favourable report. I was asked for 10 million. I said I did not have it, told them to write what they wanted," she claimed.The former Devolution CS said the process to clear her had been derailed by people with hidden agenda about her, which led to her victimisation despite her record at the ministry."All my issues are allegations and I know my problems started when NYS youth went into Kibera probably because we did more in 3 years than what leaders there had in 25 years," Waiguru said.Waiguru accused Opposition leader Raila Odinga of defaming her by connecting her to the NYS scam.Read: Raila wants Uhuru as witness in court over Anne Waiguru"I have been a scapegoat from the beginning and I therefore sued Raila for defamation and the matter is in court. The only thing that will stop him from defending himself in court is presidency and he will not be President," Waiguru said.Waiguru emphasied that the Sh1.8 billion was recovered but was not given coverage by the media and the negativity led to her leaving office as Devolution CS."There are no two laws in Kenya, that one applies to citizens, the other to Waiguru; yet the media focused the negatives with the &lsquo;wars&rsquo; getting to me and my children. I made the decision to leave office."More on this: Devolution CS Anne Waiguru resigns, cites poor health and attacks against familyThe Kirinyaga governor hopeful under the Jubilee party ticket said she will name the people responsible for jjer woes in the public service in the book she is writing."I am writing a book and I will give names in the book where the truth will be known by Kenyans."This comes as Waiguru moved to the High Court to challenge a report recommending she should be barred from holding a public office. She wants the court to declare, as null and void, the PAC report on the multi-billion shilling NYS scandal.
