The Senate has cleared Kisii governor James Ongwae of irregularities in connection with the procurement of Kenya Red Cross ambulances. In a report by the auditor general for the 2014/15 financial year, Ongwae was accused of flouting procurement laws by engaging Red Cross services without a valid renewal contract. The county made payments to the Kenya Red Cross for the lease of ambulances for three months after the valid contract expired. The contract expired on October 22, 2014, but the county made payments amounting to Sh5.7 million until January 2015.

"Our delivery delayed occasioning the extension of the Red Cross contract. The delay was not foreseen." He said they continued to engage the relief agency so that services to Kisii residents were uninterrupted. "This was so until our ambulances were delivered," Ongwae told the committee chaired by Kisumu Senator Anyang’ Nyong’o.

"This forced the county to take emergency measures to extend the contract." "I can see the procedure was accordingly followed upon perusal of documents. Because the county government could not foresee the delay, it was proper to continue engaging the services of Red Cross," Nyong’o said. "The onus to prove the delay is on the supplier and not on the governor, the query is therefore cleared."
