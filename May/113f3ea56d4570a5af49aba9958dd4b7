Cord has applied to be a party to a case challenging a decision to give returning officers at constituency level final say on presidential election results. The opposition coalition says the matter is of public interest and bears a direct bearing on the conduct of the August 8 general election. IEBC filed an appeal to contest a High Court ruling that presidential election results announced at the constituency level will be final. The ruling stripped the electoral agency of powers to announce, tally or even vary those results.

"In which interest is this appeal made? That's mischief and we will not participate in the elections of 2017," NASA coordinating commitee's James Orengo said. But IEBC described the court ruling as “a recipe for chaos”. Chairman
Wafula Chebukati said: "I was dismayed by that ruling for the simple
reason that presidential results are supposed to be announced at the
national tallying centre by the national returning officer, who is the
chairman of the IEBC. That is very clear in the law,"
