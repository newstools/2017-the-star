Busia county MCA Godfrey Odongo wants the assembly leadership to amend the Standing Orders to accommodate independent members in case they win the elections.Odongo, the Nambale Township MCA, said the current Standing Orders only recognise two sides in the house - the majority and the minority.&ldquo;They did not contemplate a House where we have independent members. &ldquo;In our county we have an independent candidate vying for the governor post. There are other strong candidates running for the posts as independents,&rdquo; he said.Odongo went on, &ldquo;I was foreseeing a situation where independents form the majority in the House. What will happen yet the Standing Orders do not provide for them?&rdquo;The MCA said the Standing Orders need to be reviewed to cater for any eventuality.Odongo is also the chairman of the Transport, Public Works and Disaster Management Committee.He said the House also needs to look at the grey areas in the laws that do not allow independent members to nominate MCAs.&ldquo;Only registered parties are given powers to nominate. Until political parties mature to hold credible elections there will be a scenario where independents in all the levels of representations will continue to rise, thus the need to provide for such eventualities,&rdquo; Odongo said.
