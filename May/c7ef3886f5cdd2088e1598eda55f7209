Women&rsquo;s rights organisations and African feminists have cited religion and culture as a major threat to women&rsquo;s rights and gender equality.The human rights campaigners from 150 women&rsquo;s organisations from 35 African countries convened in Nairobi yesterday to discuss, among other things, how far governments have delivered on gender equality and empowerment of women and girls.The African Women&rsquo;s Development and Communication Network, which hosted the conference, said the increasing threat to women&rsquo;s choices is in religious extremism. Its theme was &lsquo;Safeguarding our gains, African women collective action on defining the pathway to achieve Sustainable Development&rsquo;.Through its executive director Dinah Musindarwezo, FEMNET said societies and individuals are using culture and religion to justify the continued discrimination of women.She cited the abduction of young girls by Boko Haram in Nigeria as an illustration of how religious extremism has undermined gender equality.Dinah added that morality laws, escalating military spending and dwindling resources for womens rights organisations have worsened gender inequalities, instead of eroding them.&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why this convention by African women&rsquo;s rights organisations is quite timely. We hope together we will find solutions and strategies to address the challenges we are all facing,&rdquo; she said.A representative from Morocco said with Islamic governments coming into power, women&rsquo;s rights might be taken away. She said Morocco has only one female minister, despite continued activism.&ldquo;We need help in such countries. We are regressing instead of improving and raising the bar on gender equality,&rdquo; she said. Garissa county Health and Sanitation executive Hubbie Hussein said the concerns raised by the Moroccan representative are legitimate and urged pressure groups to intervene. But she said some Muslims misinterpret the Q&rsquo;uran and Kenya being a secular country, it is not a real concern &ldquo;as we are required to abide by the Constitution&rdquo;.&ldquo;These people hold that certain specific values and behaviours they support are the only valid, correct and acceptable beliefs, hence form the basis of their actions,&rdquo; she said.
