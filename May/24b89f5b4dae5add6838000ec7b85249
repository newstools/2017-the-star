The Independent and Boundaries Commission should be supported for implementing the conditions &ndash; in other words the law &ndash; concerning independent presidential candidates.Although there is a hue and cry raised by some independents, the conditions help weed out nuisance-value-only presidential bids that are a waste of time, money and energies.The Constitution of Kenya 2010 gave independent candidates their independence. But it has taken two general elections (2007 and 2013) and the most shambolic party primary season in the history of Kenyan electioneering (2017) for independents to come out in large and purposeful numbers.There should be better planning and preparation for 2022. The independents should not wait to become refugees from political parties before making their move.The polls before which thousands of independents prepare for at least four-and-a-half years before Election Day are yet to be scheduled in Kenya. When that time comes, the political parties will get a long-awaited run for their money.
