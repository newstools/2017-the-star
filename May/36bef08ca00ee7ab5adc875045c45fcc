Jubilee MPs from Ukambani will on Friday meet professionals to strategise how to campaign for President Uhuru Kenyatta’s reelection. Mbooni MP Kisoi Munyao said the team is determined to win over many voters from the opposition zone. “We must tell our people the truth - that the opposition has nothing to offer,” Munyao told the Star on the phone yesterday. He said Jubilee regional leaders have been tasked with “leading the Kamba community in the right political direction after [Wiper leader] Kalonzo Musyoka failed to clinch the NASA presidential ticket”. Munyao said, “If you listened to Wiper leaders who met in Machakos on Friday last week, none of them addressed the issues affecting our people. They had hoped Kalonzo would run for the presidency, but he didn’t make it. The time has come for change and  we are up to the task of taking our people back to the government for their share.” Munyao is among a group of MPs who defected from Wiper. The JP Ukambani MPs are supported by prominent figures appointed by the party from Makueni, Machakos and Kitui counties. They include businessmen and high-ranking professionals. Munyao said MPs have been issued new Prados, two trucks for roadshows and Sh60 million campaign materials including Jubilee branded T-shirts, posters and banners donated by businessman Peter Muthoka. Munyao said the campaign team includes Health CS Cleopa Mailu, Mutua Kilaka (Treasury principal administrative secretary), Victor Kyalo (ICT PS)and Monica Juma (Foreign Affairs PS). They are tasked with ensuring President Uhuru Kenyatta gets 500,000 votes from the region.
