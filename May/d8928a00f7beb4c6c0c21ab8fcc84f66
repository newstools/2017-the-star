Former Minister Henry Kosgey has conceded defeat in the Nandi governor race a week he lost to Senator Stephen Sang. &ldquo;In any democratic process, there is a winner who is fronted by the majority. &lsquo;&lsquo; We went through a rigorous process of selecting a flag bearer for the Nandi Jubilee Party candidate and the people made their choice,&rdquo; he said in a statement to residents. Kosgey has denied reports he did not accept the results and he is contemplating to run as an independent candidate. &ldquo;The results show the Nandi people have made their decision and we have to go by that,&rdquo; Kosgey said. Sang was declared winner after garnering 85,971 votes and Kosgey was second with 41,084.
