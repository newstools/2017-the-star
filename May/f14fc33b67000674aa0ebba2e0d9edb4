Meru Senator aspirant Kobia Maranya caused a buzz on Sunday when he presented his nomination papers before IEBC while riding a donkey cart.Maranya waved to crowds on the cart that was decorated with his campaign posters, while a small crowd trailed him.The independent candidate said there is no need to be extravagant during campaigns."My competitors have bought big cars, others have bought choppers worth hundreds of millions while our people continue to languish in poverty. I will instead use Sh2 million (set aside for nomination) to buy food for the poor," he said.He compared the nomination process to a wedding saying,"If you go to a wedding with two witnesses, you will still get your marriage certificate and it does not mean God will not bless you with children," Maranya said.He asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to emulate him and instead use cash for campaigns to help needy people.Maranya will face off against Jubilee's Mithika Linturi and PNU's Mugambi Imanyara in the August 8 polls.
