He said the people who voted for Mudavadi in the 2013 election were New Ford Kenya supporters who have joined Jubilee.The former Local Government minister was speaking at his home in Webuye.&ldquo;The 470,000 votes Musalia got in 2013, half of them were from Bungoma and New Ford Kenya supporters. So now I wonder where will he get votes to deliver to Raila?&rdquo; Kombo posed.New Ford-K was one of the parties that merged to form the Jubilee Party.Kombo, who lost the Bungoma senator race in 2013 to Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula, said Mudavadi did not get votes in his Vihiga county.Mudavadi was defeated on his home turf by Cord candidate Raila Odinga. Kombo asked: What political value will he then add to Raila&rsquo;s campaign?He said all the votes Mudavadi garnered from Bungoma and Trans Nzoia in 2013 will go to President Uhuru Kenyatta.Kombo said Mudavadi and Wetang&rsquo;ula have betrayed the Luhya community by agreeing to back Raila&rsquo;s fourth bid for President&ldquo;I and Eugene Wamalwa sacrificed and supported Musalia as our son thinking that even if he didn&rsquo;t win in 2013 he could be on the ballot this year, only [for him] to come out and betray the Luhya community,&rdquo; he said.Kombo said the former Deputy Prime Minister hoodwinked the Luhya community. This may prove costly for his future presidential ambitions, he said.&ldquo;How do those who supported him in 2013 feel now after he abandoned his presidential bid and asked us to support Raila,&rdquo; Kombo said.He asked the Luhya community to support President Uhuru&rsquo;s reelection, adding that he will defeat Raila. &ldquo;I have no doubt Uhuru is going to win and I&rsquo;m urging the Luhya community not to be left out when it comes to forming the next government,&rdquo; Kombo said.
