Over the years we have enjoyed so many aspects of the Nairobi National Park. Even though I have visited many thousands of time, each visit is always a special occasion, with an air of expectation and anticipation mixed with the excitement of what could possibly be seen.There is always something attractive about water, perhaps because it brings life. Mankind also seems to be fascinated by water power such as waves, waterfalls and flooding. The park has water points spread about and includes many dams such as the Athi dam, and a number of seasonal streams that flow into the Mbagathi River.One of my favourite seasonal dams is the &lsquo;murram heaps&rsquo; near No 10 junction. During the dry season it is completely empty. The park was now looking green after a bit of rain, so we decided to check and see if any water had flowed into the small dams.Then&hellip;Wow! What a sight to see a pair of Egyptian geese as proud parents with their large family of fifteen newborn chicks. There is always something exciting and refreshing about seeing babies, and these little &ldquo;fluffballs&rdquo; were exceptionally cute.Amazingly, their colours and markings looked different from their parents. I watched them as they swam across the water, and went into the green cover on some lilies. Young chicks often have a high mortality in the wild, however, I hope these survive.Egyptian geese are scientifically classified as ducks, and have beautiful body markings when they mature into adults. It is worth spending some time watching them. Clearly these proud parents now have a wonderful family to fight to protect. The park is open daily from 06h00 to 19h00.
