Jubilee Party is expected to hold a mega political rally in Laikipia on Saturday on consolidating their votes for President Uhuru Kenyatta's re-electionThe host, Laikipia Governor Joshua Irungu, said on Friday that all leaders from Mt Kenya region will hold a consultative meeting on voter mobilisation mechanisms.Irungu said they were concerned about the large number of politicians who have decided to vie independently as they might get sympathy votes.The Governor also noted the fall of bigwigs such as Kiambu chief William Kabogo and Kirinyaga's Joseph Ndathi could make matters worse should urgent action not be taken."It is critical that Jubilee nominees consult and come up with strong mechanisms on sensitizing and mobilising our people to come out in large numbers to vote," he said. "Mt Kenya remains a Jubilee stronghold. It is therefore no crime for the region to endorse Uhuru's presidency. We have realised much development under Jubilee...that&rsquo;s why our support is essential."The bigwigs will not attend the meeting."They will have their parallel meeting elsewhere. We decided to have an in-house sitting and chart the way forward before bringing them on board," said Irungu.It is said that all losers from the region have formed an alliance of independent candidates likely to change the political landscape.Read: Mt Kenya Jubilee officials accuse 'employee' Tuju of undermining themAlso read: Move on or work with Jubilee, NEB boss Musangi tells nominations losersIrungu dismissed claims that the meeting is tribalistic and aimed at intimidating other regions to protect the presidency."We are not in any way tribal. We want to stretch our vote-hunting to the neighboring counties of Isiolo, Samburu and Pokot," he said.The Laikipia meeting is said to be coordinated by 10 counties including Nairobi, Kiambu and Murang'a.The coordinators are Susan Kihika (Nakuru), Irungu Kangata (Murang'a), Anne Waiguru (Kirinyaga), John Kiarie and Stephen Kariuki (Nairobi), Ngunjiri Wambugu (Nyeri), Amos Kimunya (Nyandarua), Florence Kajuju (Meru), Leonard Muriuki (Embu), Gathoni wa Muchomba (Kiambu) and Muthomi Njuki(Tharaka Nithi).The party is also plotting a mission to NASA strongholds.Insiders said the purpose of the Nanyuki meeting that DP William Ruto will attend is to fight the strong wave of independent candidates.Reports indicate that operatives in the Office of the President are believed to the independent candidates' main sponsors including the meeting at Kasarani on Saturday.
