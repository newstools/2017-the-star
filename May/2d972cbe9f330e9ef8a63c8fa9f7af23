Busia county election manager Fredrick Apopa has said any perpetrator of violence during the election will be punished. He said he will ensure a free, fair and transparent election in August. Apopa spoke during a meeting with party nominees in Matayos constituency IEBC office on Tuesday. “We have clear laws and the Election Act that explains how candidates should conduct themselves,” he said. The meeting was attended by Busia Deputy Governor Kizito Wangalwa. Wangalwa defended NASA presidential flagbearer Raila Odinga’s call to support only alliance candidates and reject independents. “You know when a father says something a child is not supposed to argue, but follow what he says. The party leader has given direction,” he said. Woman rep hopeful Susan Mangeni said female candidates need protection.
