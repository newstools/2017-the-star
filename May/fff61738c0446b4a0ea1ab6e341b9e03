Senators should ensure counties receive an extra Sh28 billion to carry out their mandate effectively, Council of Governors chairman Peter Munya has said.The Treasury had proposed shareable county revenue of Sh299 billion for 2017-18, but slashed it to Sh291 billion in December last year. This was despite governors asking for more funds and MPs&rsquo; own earlier admission that counties are being underfunded by the Treasury.On March 1, the Senate approved shareable revenue of Sh314 billion. Last year, the Commission for Revenue Allocation had proposed counties get more than Sh320 billion.Munya on Wednesday urged the Senate to help counties get more money to improve growth.&ldquo;Kenyans devolved government. That is because they wanted to simplify processes, reduce bureaucracy and make it easy for service delivery to be quick and affordable at the local level.&ldquo;What we turned out to be doing is more difficult, more expensive and this is why we say we need to look into this issue,&rdquo; the Meru governor said.Munya spoke to journalists at Meru National Polytechnic after launching two saccos &mdash; Al-Mujarah for Muslims and another for people living with disability.He said the national government has been frustrating counties that became functional in 2013. &ldquo;Counties have gone through a very difficult stage. You are at a formative stage with new government, then you are subjected to impossible demands that make it very difficult for you to provide services,&rdquo; he added.The national government accuses counties of corruption, but does not fight graft within the national government with the same zeal, Munya said.&ldquo;If it is about corruption, it is in counties but you see bubbling corruption in the national government level. &ldquo;Why are there no similar requirements at the national governments to deal with huge budgets? Some of them borrowed money every day,&rdquo; he said.Meanwhile, the governor said the state has released nurses&rsquo; and doctors&rsquo; extra allowances. He insisted it should also release funds for clinical officers and other cadres entitled to increments.The national government should also honour its pledge to channel about Sh2 billion to pay doctors for the 100 days they were on strike, Munya said.
