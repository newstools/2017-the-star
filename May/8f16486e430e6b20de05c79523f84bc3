Lamu residents yesterday demonstrated outside the Malindi law courts.They demanded the withdrawal of a land case to pave way for a Sh21 billion wind energy project in Baharini, Mpeketoni.The residents asked Cordisons International to withdraw the case and allow Kenwind Holdings - a Belgian company - to set up the proposed project.Cordison, owned by three Kenyan brothers, two of them living in the US, moved to court to compel the NLC and its chairman Muhammad Swazuri to issue lease documents as directed by the county government to put up the project.Kenwind is a subsidiary of Belgian renewable energy giant Elicio NV, and plans to set up a wind power plant that will produce 90MW on 3,200 acres.Cordisons obtained orders from the Land and Environment Court restraining Kenwind from implementing the project until the case is determined.Addressing journalists outside the Malindi law courts yesterday, the residents said the case was frustrating the investor and wasting time and money.Linus Gachoki, a resident of Baharini, said, &ldquo;I do not know why the matter was brought to court yet the county government of Lamu issued a place for implementing the project.&rdquo;He said residents have suffered because of the pending case and requested it be withdrawn.Ibrahim Shahib, the chairman of the Lamu Interface Initiative, said the organisation supports the project because &ldquo;it would benefit the people of Mpeketoni.&rdquo;Kenwind is opposed to the suit, which is challenging the process of acquisition of 11,000 acres and the development plan for the implementation of the project.Susan Nandwa, a representative of Kenwind, said the project has faced many challenges.&ldquo;We are not afraid because we followed the legal procedures to obtain the land,&rdquo; she said. Nandwa said the Belgian company got approvals from the county assembly, Ministry of Energy, and consulted the NLC during the acquisition.She urged the Lamu government to address the matter. Earlier, the matter had come up before Lands and Environment Court Justice James Olola.Justice Olola is set to make ruling on the preliminary objections on July 7.
