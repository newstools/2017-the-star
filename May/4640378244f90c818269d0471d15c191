The state has been put on the spot for demanding more budgetary allocations amounting to billions of shillings in the Supplementary Budget without justifying the increase.The Parliamentary Budget Office is questioning some state departments&rsquo; plea to Parliament for more money to fund programmes Treasury had slashed in initial budgets. The state is seeking MPs&rsquo; approval for a Sh64.1 billion 2016-17 Supplementary II Budget estimates for spending before the next financial year. A sum of Sh6.5 billion is to cater for recurrent spending and Sh42.1 billion for development.The Interior ministry under CS Joseph Nkaissery, for instance, is on the spot for demanding Sh523 million for programmes such as purchase of motor cycles for chiefs and their assistants and purchase of vehicles, yet the budgets were reduced. The Parliamentary Accounts Oversight Office points out that the ministry cannot explain the purpose of the increased allocation.&ldquo;It is indicated that the state department has been allocated an additional Sh3.7 billion for recruitment and training of police officers as well as enhanced security operations ahead of the election,&rdquo; reads a PBO report. &ldquo;This cannot clearly be traced in the budget books. The number of police officers to be recruited remains the same as per the initial targets,&rdquo; it adds. The report says most proposed changes, whether an increase or reduction in development expenditure, lie heavily on scaling up donor financing.&ldquo;Of the Sh42.1 billion development budget, Sh32.7 billion, equivalent to 78 per cent, is donor funds. This has serious implications on the public debt,&rdquo; PBO warns. The office says clarity is needed on increased donor funds to determine the perceived benefits of the projects with respect to the expenditure.
