The government will ship close to 500 rapid test kits after a dengue fever outbreak was reported in Mombasa last week. A total of 352 people have been diagnosed with the mosquito-borne tropical disease in several health centres across the county.Dengue is a mosquito-borne infection that causes a severe flu-like illness, and sometimes a potentially lethal complication called dengue hemorrhagic fever.&lsquo;NOT SURPRISED&rsquo;The virus is transmitted from one person to another through the bite of mosquitoes and the &ldquo;attack rate is very high but mortality is very low&rdquo;.Sultani Matendechero, head of the Neglected Tropical Diseases Unit at the Health ministry, told the Star that a response team will also be formed and will work together with the Mombasa government to contain the situation.&ldquo;We are not really surprised with the outbreak. Such cases are expected to go up as a result of the rainy season. The outbreak also comes at a time when we had just concluded a study on dengue fever in Mombasa,&rdquo; Matendechero said.The kits can test for both new infections as well as those who were exposed to the disease before.&ldquo;Those who were exposed to the virus before and are infected again, they need to be monitored closely, because one of the factors that can lead to severe dengue is a re-infection. We need to be more careful when dealing with these cases,&rdquo; Matendechero said.He added: &ldquo;There are four types of dengue virus. When you are infected with one type and re-infected with another type, your body produces antibodies for the first infection and then it reacts with the second infection. So it is your own antibody that causes the severeness of the disease,&rdquo; YEARLONG STUDYThe yearlong study was conducted by the ministry and the Dengue Fever Vaccine Institute in Mvita subcounty, Tudor Hospital, Ngajoni Health Centre and at the Coast General Hospital.Anybody who walked in a health facility with a high fever was subjected to a dengue test as the symptoms of this tropical disease are similar to malaria. They include: high fever, severe headaches, severe joint and muscle pain, fatigue, vomiting and nausea.In cases of sever dengue fever, the patient would have a skin rash, which would appear two to five days after the onset of fever.There is no cure for dengue fever. Healthcare workers only offer supportive care to the patient.&ldquo;Because it is a viral infection, we will only be dealing with the problem that is affecting the patient,&rdquo;In 2011, a similar outbreak was reported in Mandera, where more than 1,000 people were infected with the disease.
