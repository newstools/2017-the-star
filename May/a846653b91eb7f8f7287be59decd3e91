Nairobi county has launched a crackdown on parking defaulters to recover Sh8 billion in unpaid fees.Operation Revenue Drive is spearheaded by county secretary Robert Ayisi and Parking Services director Fredrick Ndunyu. It was launched in the Industrial Area last Thursday.&ldquo;Our aim is to collect between Sh2 million and Sh3 million per day. We are up to the task and my officers have been instructed to use due diligence when dealing with residents,&rdquo; Ndunyu said.&ldquo;We tell them [motorists] to pay and warn the defaulters that they will be dealt with accordingly.&rdquo;He said double-parked vehicles will be towed and their owners charged in court for flouting parking rules. The county automated payment of parking fees in 2015.
