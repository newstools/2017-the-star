A handcart pusher convicted of the murder of independence politician Pio Gama Pinto was on Friday awarded Sh2.5 million for violation of his rights by the police while in custody.Kisilu Mutua was sentenced to death in 1965, following Pinto&rsquo;s assassination.Pinto was a leading freedom fighter in Kenya.After serving 35 years in jail, President Daniel Moi pardoned him and ordered his release on July 4, 2001.On Friday, Justice John Mativo said Mutua&rsquo;s incarceration was unlawful and the action by state agents were in violation of his constitutional rights.Mativo said Mutua demonstrated he was tortured by the police who squeezed his testicles until he lost consciousness.&ldquo;I am persuaded the petitioner proved to the required standard that his rights were violated by the police, considering the nature of torture meted out on him during the time of arrest and when he was taken to court to face murder charge,&rdquo; the judge said.Mativo said the court cannot deviate from its duty of deterring acts which amount to the infringement of the constitutional rights of a citizen.Mutua had told the court he was arrested by six people while drinking at the New Rwathia Bar with friends.He was then taken to Eastleigh police station, where his toes were mercilessly thrashed with a rungu and his testicles squeezed.He also told the judge he was interrogated and tortured by European and African police officers who wanted him to confess to murdering Pinto, a Kenyan of Asian origin who was gunned down as he drove out of his house in a Nairobi suburb.When he refused to confess, he was forced to sign a statement admitting he murdered Pinto.&ldquo;I was also detained at Pangani police station, where I was brutalised by police officers, forcing me to sign a confession statement at the point of death,&rdquo; he stated in an affidavit.Mutua made an appeal to the then East Africa Court of Appeal.It was dismissed on November 12, 1965.He then moved to the High Court in 2015 seeking several declarations, which included the abuse of his fundamental rights.Mativo said the Constitution prohibits torture and inhumane acts as well as degrading treatment of suspects in the hands of police.
