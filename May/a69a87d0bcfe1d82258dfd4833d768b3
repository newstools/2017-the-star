A judge has allowed the electoral commission to proceed with the tendering for ballot papers for the August election.Justice George Odunga on Tuesday issued a temporary order suspending the decision of the procurement board, which annulled the ongoing tendering.This in effect means that the IEBC is at liberty to go ahead with the process, now that the decision that annulled the process has been halted.His order arose out of an application filed by Cecil James Oyugi, suing the Public Procurement Administrative Review Board and the IEBC.In his suit papers, Oyugi faults the decision by the procurement board, which annulled the tendering process, saying it will compel the IEBC to do single-sourcing.The tender in question was initially granted to Al Ghurair Printing &amp; Publishing company, but was challenged in court over failure to follow the laid down procedures.It was annulled by the court and the IEBC directed to tender afresh.The matter found its way through a different party to the procurement board, which gave a verdict after hearing the parties. On May 19, the procurement board gave a judgment annulling the tendering.The board, in reaching its verdict, ignored the fact that the tendering process was done pursuant to an earlier order given by the court.The court was told the board was in a way trying to circumvent the court order and erred in law by allowing a party forum to challenge the tendering process, knowing the party lacked legal authority.Oyugi says if the decision by the procurement board is allowed to stand, the IEBC will get a perfect chance to single-source, instead of engaging in a transparent tendering process. After hearing Oyugi, the judge directed that the board file be brought before him on May 25.The case will be heard this morning.
