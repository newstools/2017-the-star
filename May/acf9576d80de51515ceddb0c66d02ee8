Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama says he could shift his political base and run for Nairobi senator.In an interview with Citizen TV on Tuesday night, Muthama said Wiper Party leader Kalonzo Musyoka had pleaded with him not to move to Nairobi.&ldquo;I had that idea last month. But the Wiper Party leader himself told me he wanted me to remain in Machakos so that I can campaign for the party.&ldquo;And so it is clear that my involvement in the region&rsquo;s politics is highly required,&rdquo; Muthama said.He was responding to a question by host Hussein Mohammed.The senator said he will only run for reelection in Machakos if Wiper governor nominee Wavinya Ndeti and Governor Alfred Mutua are not the only candidates facing off on August 8.Muthama denied he has resigned from the party, saying the only thing he will not do is to actively campaign for Wiper in Machakos.&ldquo;Wiper does not belong to Kalonzo alone, but to all of us. I am a life member of Wiper and I continue to pay monthly contributions.&ldquo;I have something in there and when I will decide to leave I will leave with it,&rdquo; Muthama said.He repeated that his differences with Kalonzo are purely based on the &ldquo;total sham&rdquo; party primaries in the three counties of Ukambani.Muthama said Machakos nomination was the least fair.&ldquo;What happened was not nomination. Will you call it democracy when one of the candidates, [Deputy Governor] Bernard Kiala, having paid nominations fees in full only gets to know of an existing agreement between Wiper and CCU on the eve of the nominations?&rdquo; Muthama said.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see the point of being the Machakos Senator if the governor is either Wavinya or Mutua. The two are no different at all,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Never again do I want to go through what I have in the last four years &mdash; fighting court battles to defend people&rsquo;s rights,&rdquo; Muthama said.He said the only way Kalonzo can mend fences with him is by respecting every aspirant&rsquo;s rights.&ldquo;You respect people&rsquo;s rights, you walk with me. You mistreat people and you part ways with Muthama,&rdquo; the senator said. &ldquo;I regret the way Wiper is being micro-managed,&rdquo; he told a press conference on Monday.&ldquo;You respect people&rsquo;s rights, you walk with me. You mistreat people you part ways with Muthama,&rdquo; the senator said.
