National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale yesterday rubbished claims by Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka that Deputy President William Ruto is behind the closure of his foundation.He told Kalonzo to account for donations made towards the foundation and stop looking for scapegoats.Duale spoke in Diiso, Garissa county, during a rally.&ldquo;I want to tell Kalonzo that you have misappropriated funds meant for the vulnerable. You were given money by the Chinese to construct schools in Makueni and Kitui counties, but instead pocketed it,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Carry your own cross and stop dragging and soiling the Deputy President&rsquo;s name in your anguish. I wonder how Ruto comes in, unless you have substantial evidence linking him.&rdquo;The NGO Coordination Board on Tuesday suspended the Kalonzo Musyoka Foundation for among other things, allegedly failing to account for Sh146 million received from donors. It also froze the Foundation&rsquo;s accounts. Kalonzo on Wednesday claimed the DP &lsquo;engineered&rsquo; the closure of the Foundation. But the DP, through his spokesman David Mugonyi, dismissed the claims and accused Kalonzo of playing politics.
