Businessman Bundotich Kiprop, popularly known as Buzeki, has denied taking land from a widow.Pauline Jepketer, 78, says Buzeki conned her out of a Sh200 million plot in Nairobi. Jepketer&rsquo;s sons Ronald Kiptanui, Daniel Kipkorir and Donald Kipruto say their mother is being used by cartels to damage Buzeki&rsquo;s reputation in Uasin Gishu.Buzeki is running for Uasin Gishu governor.The three sons say, instead, it is the family who owes Buzeki Sh43 million.&ldquo;Our mother is being misused by cartels, which have been misleading and conning her. Now they are using her to damage the name of Buzeki who is our cousin and has been very helpful to this family. This is pure malice,&rdquo; Kiptanui said.The widow has told the media that on June 20, 2012, she signed an agreement to sell the land to Buzeki as an administrator of her late husband Samuel Cherop&rsquo;s estate.The agreement was executed by a Mombasa firm known as Bunoil Limited, associated with Buzeki and his brother Edward Bundotich.Jepketer said the sale agreement was for Sh180 million and Buzeki partly paid her through cheques, after which she surrendered her title. She said the cheques worth Sh12 million bounced and she failed to get back the title from Buzeki.&ldquo;I have used so much money looking for the title without success and now I am now too old. I have not been assisted, even in many government offices I have visited,&rdquo; Jepketer said.But her sons say their mother is not listed as an administrator of the land, which is owned by three parties, not the family alone.Lawyers for the family, Kipkenda and Company Advocates, say the land is owned in equal shares by three parties, including Samuel Cherop.&ldquo;The owners sold the land to Bunoil Ltd through an agreement on May 14, 2012, but the agreement was frustrated by the then City Council of Nairobi, which said the land belongs to Garden Estate Primary School,&rdquo; the firm said.The City Council moved to court to block Bunoil from taking over the land. A court later ordered the school be moved but the order has never been implemented. The school continues to occupy the land, making it impossible for Bunoil to move in.
