Kanu secretary general Nick Salat was yesterday sentenced to three months in jail after he was found guilty of contempt of orders issued by the Political Parties Disputes Tribunal.Salat, however, opted to pay a fine of Sh200,000.While reading the judgment, tribunal chairman, Kyalo Mbobu, said Salat and Kanu&rsquo;s chairman of Elections Board, Edward Kivuvani, went against an order requiring them to conduct fresh polls for Fafi parliamentary seat.The orders were issued on May 5 after Salah Farah, an aspirant who lost in the nominations, filed a petition.The party was ordered to conduct repeat nominations within 12 hours in at least half of the 49 polling stations in the constituency.Fafi constituency has five wards namely Bura, Dekaharia, Jarajila, Fafi and Nanighi.&ldquo;The nominations should be free, fair, and transparent, and should be conducted pursuant to consultation with all aspirants,&rdquo; Mbobu said.The tribunal was told the party primaries conducted in Fafi constituency started after 2pm, denying many voters a right to participate.In mitigation, Salat (pictured) had told the tribunal his party could not hold fresh nominations because of logistical reasons, saying the timelines set by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission for parties to submit names had lapsed.But the tribunal in its ruling said Kanu did not carry out a fair and transparent exercise in the area, and many voters were denied their right to pick their preferred candidate.The tribunal ruled any nomination certificate that had been issued by the party is null and void.
