King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands has been flying as a co-pilot for a KLM airlines affiliate for 21 years.The King acceded to the throne in 2013 said he has doing this as well as working on his monarchical laurels."I find flying simply fantastic," he said.According to the USA today, King Willem intends to carry on as co-pilot but will spend the coming months learning how to fly Boeing 737s.He revealed to remain incognito, he never used his name when addressing passengers and was rarely recognised in uniform and wearing his KLM cap. However, he admitted that some passengers had recognised his voice."The advantage is that I can always say that I warmly welcome passengers on behalf of the captain and crew," he said. "Then I don't have to give my name."What was not clear was that he was co-piloting passenger flights incognito, twice a month as king, often with KLM Captain Maarten Putman.The Dutch government said last month that he had flown Fokker 70 aircraft for both the government and KLM Cityhopper service, and that the plane was being replaced this year with a 737. Cityhopper flights are aimed mainly at business travellers in dozens of European destinations, particularly in the UK, Germany and Norway.Willem-Alexander once said that if he had not been born in a palace, his dream would have been to fly a big passenger plane such as a Boeing 747, so it is no surprise that he intends to retrain for the updated plane.
