Athi Water Services Board chairman Wachira Keen has told off disgruntled Jubilee aspirants over their threats to join NASA. He said the politicians, whom he termed self-seekers, cannot tilt the political scales or influence the voting patterns of Nyeri people. Keen further dismissed the group as failed politicians who have never even won ward representative posts. "Nyeri people in general fully support President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto," he told journalists on Thursday. "Let the disgruntled leaders accept the outcome of the primaries and desist from apportioning blame for their failed bids." Keen spoke after those who lost in the Jubilee primaries in Nyeri said they will work with Raila Odinga in August. Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper), Musalia Mudavadi (Amani National Congress), Moses Wetang'ula (Ford K) and Isaac Rutto of CCM are members of the coalition.
