A court has declined to allow the prosecution to use payment invoices as a basis for questioning Garissa Governor Nathif Jama and others accused of irregular ambulance leasing.Jama and six former Tender Committee members are accused of failing to comply with procurement procedures in a contract with the Kenya Red Cross Society&rsquo;s Emergency Plus to lease seven ambulances in 2014.The other accused are Rahma Dekow, Jawahir Keinan, Abdi Sahal, Safia Mohamed, Mohamed Hassan and Mohamud Hassan Mohamed.On Friday, senior magistrate Cosmas Maundu said the invoices cannot be admitted as exhibits because their authenticity was questioned by the head of Emergency Plus, when she had testified earlier.This came up after EACC financial analyst Timothy Wahome told the court they had depended on the documents to approximate the total amount of the Sh70 million deal that is under scrutiny.However, the defence argued that the analyst should not answer to questions on or verify the details in the documents because the EACC is not the original author.Prosecutor Omondi Opondo then asked the court to allow the prosecution to recall the head of Emergency Plus to verify the details.The defence was opposed, arguing that would drag out the court process and give grounds for a mistrial.Earlier, former Water executive Muktar Bulale had appeared as a prosecution witness and sought to directly link the governor to unprocedurally pushing for the leasing of the ambulances.He told the court that the process was rushed, done without requisite budgetary allocations and conducted without a proper cost benefit analysis.But when pressed for specifics and hard evidence, Bulale said he could not remember all the events that took place. He recanted some of his claims.Bulale was hard pressed to explain if he was testifying against the governor to settle old scores since the governor had sacked him only two weeks before the commencement of the case.The proceedings continue on May 25 and 26.
