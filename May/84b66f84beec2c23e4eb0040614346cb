Sabatia MP Alfred Agoi has said the amendment of the Political Parties Act - and consequent abolition of party hopping - was a mistake. He on Monday said independent candidates have created tension in political parties. If elected, Agoi said he will table a motion to amend the act. He urged all those who lost in the ANC primaries not to submit their papers as independents to the IEBC on June 2. Agoi said the party will find a place for them. He said those who submit their papers are Jubilee sympathisers. “They will split NASA votes,” Agoi said. He addressed parents at Ikobero Girls’ Seconary School in Vihiga county. Agoi echoed Amani leader Musalia Mudavadi’s sentiments that his party risks not getting funding because of the big number of Independent candidates. He said for a party to qualify for funding, it needs to have at least 20 per cent of the votes, three governors and senators, 20 MPs and 40 MCAs. On Sunday when he addressed ANC aspirants, Mudavadi said independent candidates were denying ANC the chance to benefit from funding.
