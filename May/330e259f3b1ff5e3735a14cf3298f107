Jubilee Party yesterday wrote to the Clerk of the Senate, Jeremiah Nyegeye, opposing 15 independent candidates and four nominees eyeing East Africa Legislative Assembly. Nyegeye is also the chief executive of the Parliamentary Service Commission.In the letter, JP, through majority leader in the National Assembly Aden Duale, says the opposition submitted names of four nominees to limit the House from making choices during voting.&ldquo;I hereby wish to lodge my party&rsquo;s two objections to the nomination of persons to vie for election as members of EALA...In forwarding four names, the coalition mischievously seeks to deny the House the freedom of choice to reject any or all of the four candidates,&rdquo; Duale said. Nyegeye is heading the team vetting the applicants. The process is ongoing.&ldquo;This is clearly a mischievous attempt to tie the freedom of choice at the voting stage, more so where the records indicate that at the time of the close of applications, Cord had 41 applicants; 24 in the National Assembly and 17 in the Senate.&rdquo;The coalition, led by Raila Odinga, has nominated, for the second time, Zein Abubakar and Judith Pareno. Ronald Kipng&rsquo;etich from Bomet county is also in the list, again. Kennedy Musyoka, the son of Wiper leader Kalonzo Mosyoka, is also a nominee.Duale asked Cord to provide minutes of the meeting when a decision to nominate the four was made, to prove the process was transparent and democratic.On the 15 independent candidates, JP said Cord did not collect the required one million signatures from registered voters, as stipulated in Article 99( 1 )(c) of the Constitution.
