Garissa Governor Nathif Jama yesterday urged residents to vote for individuals based on their development track records &mdash; not their clans.In a veiled attack on Ali Korane, his main opponent, Jama said it is unfortunate some aspirants think they can ride on clan endorsements to win election.&ldquo;We know some of them and the positions they held while in government. There is nothing to be admired or to said about them, only controversies. Voters are wiser based on the primaries, where the seasoned politicians were voted out. We shall witness a similar scenario on August 8,&rdquo; he said.Jama spoke after commissioning the Bura Water Extension Project and opening a multipurpose hall.He said he is committed to providing basic amenities and critical infrastructure to transform the county into a one-stop-shop for business and leisure.Jama urged residents to vote for him, saying he had delivered on the promises made in the 2013 campaign.He said his administration would continue to harness resources to improve livelihoods.On Thursday, Korane said he is determined to reclaim Garissa from political oblivion with the support of residents.He spoke in Nairobi during a meeting to mobilise resources for his campaign.The Abduwak clan endorsed former Information PS Korane in April last year to run for Garissa governor.After the endorsement, Korane accused the county administration of widespread corruption that has crippled services.He said devolution was meant to bring services closer to citizens, but Jama has turned it into a &ldquo;cash cow&rdquo; and money is being looted from the county coffers. &ldquo;People are disappointed and have not seen the benefit of devolution. All the subcounties, including Nathif&rsquo;s hometown, have collapsed for lack of services,&rdquo; he said.Korane came second to Jama at the March 4, 2013, polls. Jama won narrowly with 37,910 votes against Korane&rsquo;s 35,098 votes.But Jama, who is from the Aulian clan, has always maintained that he is ready to face his contestants in the August election.He denies accusations of misuse of funds.
