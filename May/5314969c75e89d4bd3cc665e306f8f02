NASA leaders in Nairobi yesterday tore into the Jubilee administration, accusing it of killing the economy and playing politics with the lives of Kenyans.Governor Evans Kidero and Dagoretti North MP Simba Arati said the national government has failed to tackle the concerns of the common man and should not be given another chance in August.&ldquo;Now, we are buying a 2kg packet of unga at Sh180 and a kilo of sugar at Sh200. How can this happen, yet sugar lands in Mombasa at Sh75 per kilo and maize flour at Sh30 per kilo?&rdquo; Kidero asked.The governor claimed the government has colluded with farmers and millers to hoard and increase prices so that JP leaders can get money for campaigns.&ldquo;The government needs to ensure the price drops to below Sh100 per kilogramme,&rdquo; he said.Arati claimed that the food shortage and the high prices are artificial, saying the JP leaders want to benefit themselves at the expense of Kenyans.&ldquo;How can maize, move from Mexico to Kenya in a ship in two days? This is a journey that cannot take less than a month. This tells you there is something going on,&rdquo; he said.The government on Thursday imported 30,000 tonnes of maize from Mexico to address the skyrocketing prices of maize flour in the country. A 2kg packet of maize flour is retailing at Sh180, up from Sh110 a month ago, while a kilo of sugar now goes for Sh200 from Sh100.The legislator said corruption, nepotism and tribalism have thrived under the JP administration and urged Kenyans to vote them out in August.&ldquo;The only way to end these problems and have a country free from corruption and tribalism is to vote in NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga in August,&rdquo; he said. Kidero and Arati spoke at Nairobi Primary School.
