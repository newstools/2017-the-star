Nairobi Woman Representative Rachael Shebesh has been unwell and hospitalised, which explains her absence from the political scene in the last few days.The Jubilee Party member has been nursing a leg injury and was even presented with her nomination certificate while still in her hospital bed.Rachel Shebesh is set to go head to head with Esther Passaris, alias Mama Taa, in this year's election.Despite their varied opinion and parties, Esther Passaris showed her mature side as she took upon herself to visit the ailing politician, putting aside all political rivalry and proving that politics cannot come in between true friendship and girl power.The ODM party nominee put the photo as they hugged and smiled while looking at the camera, with a sweet caption that read:Earlier this afternoon, I paid a courtesy visit to Hon Shebesh who is recuperating. My supporters and I wish you a full recovery."She even explained why she brought her Chevda after a fan asked: "Yes. It's what she craved. Indian sweet chevda. I like taking patients what they desire, not the norm: fruits, flowers, lucozade, chocolate."
