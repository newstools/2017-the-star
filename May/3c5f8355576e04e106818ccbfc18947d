Safina director of elections John Wamagata has warned against voting for many independent candidates, saying they are not vetted.He also urged the electorate not to elect leaders from the same party because they might resist checks and balances. Wamagata said independent candidates will form unwanted associations in the Senate and in the national and county assemblies.&ldquo;Independent candidates might sabotage government affairs in the next Houses since some were expecting Uhuru to help them secure the JP ticket. It&rsquo;s better not to elect them,&rdquo; he said.He was speaking in Kikuyu town on Sunday when he met Safina candidates running for MP and MCA seats in Kabete and Kikuyu constituencies. Wamagata will battle for Nairobi senator on August 8.He said debates by members from different political parties are lively since leaders are accountable to their parties.
