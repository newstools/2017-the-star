Opposition leaders have been asked to stop turning political rallies into platforms for attacking personalities but instead, use it to explain their agenda.Bomet County Assembly Speaker Geoffrey Kipng&rsquo;etich and nominated MCA Wilson Keter said it is unfortunate that the opposition misuse rallies to attack Deputy President William Ruto.The duo expressed concerns over what they termed as frequent attacks on the DP by Governor Isaac Rutto and the NASA brigade during rallies. Kipng&rsquo;etich asked the opposition to strive, instead, and explain to Kenyans their agenda and avoid using rallies to &ldquo;lynch&rdquo; their political enemies, saying it would make them lose votes.He cited a recent rally in Narok where the opposition leaders Rutto, Baringo Senator Gideon Moi and a host of MPs attacked the DP.Kipng&rsquo;etich said rallies are not platforms to settle political scores.Speaking to the Star, the pair urged the opposition politicians to concentrate on how they intend to improve the lives of Kenyans.Kipng&rsquo;etich, however, said, &ldquo;The more they keep attacking the DP, the more votes they will lose. In the Rift Valley, the Deputy President possesses an enormous political clout, compared to some of the leaders opposing him.&rdquo; Keter said the Kalenjin community will no longer take lightly attacks on the DP, which he said are malicious and meant to tarnish his name.The two said Moi, Rutto and some MPs from the region should stop attacking &ldquo;one of their own&rdquo; and strive to unite the community.NASA raids on traditional Jubilee strongholds &mdash; and huge, back-to-back spirited rallies &mdash; have sent shock waves through the ruling party. The Jubilee administration is increasingly worried by the alliance&rsquo;s forays into its bedrock and fears the opposition may convert vast crowds into votes to make Uhuru Kenyatta a one-term President.
