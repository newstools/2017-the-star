Former Limuru MP Peter Mwathi&rsquo;s are relieved that he has been handed the nomination certificate.Noel Njoki said they had been anxious after the incumbent, John Kiragu, said Mwathi will be surprised when the certificate will be handed over to the MP.Mwathi was handed the nomination certificate on Sunday.Kiragu filed a petition with the party&rsquo;s complaint commission, saying there were irregularities, but the application was dismissed.&ldquo;If the party&rsquo;s complaint commission and the political parties tribunal didn&rsquo;t find irregularities as alleged, why should a person alleging votes were stolen be listened to?&rdquo; Njoki said. Mwathi was among aspirants who were handed JP certificates in Ndumberi stadium in an event led by JP secretary general Raphael Tuju. Supporter Julius Wambua urged voters to support President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s reelection. Speaking yesterday in Limuru, Mwathi said he plans to campaign for the President. &ldquo;In fact we are considering conducting door-to-door campaigns to listen to and convince people at individual level,&rdquo; Mwathi said.
