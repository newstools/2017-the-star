The Kenya National Highways Authority has re-opened the road constructed by the United for Kiambu Team following an outcry from motorists.The authority closed Chania Bridge on Saturday last week. Vehicles exiting Thika town passed through, connecting to the Thika Superhighway.Kenha officials said the road connecting the superhighway was in a dangerous spot, adding that numerous vehicles plying the Nyeri-Nairobi route could be in danger.&ldquo;This is risking the lives of motorists and passengers. We couldn&rsquo;t wait until a fatal carnage occurred here so that we take action. Vehicles are not supposed to pass through this bridge because it&rsquo;s actually a footbridge,&rdquo; an official said. The officials erected concrete barriers, preventing vehicles from passing through the bridge. &ldquo;This bridge is not designed to handle heavy weight and, therefore, allowing vehicles to use it will be jeopardising the lives of passengers,&rdquo; he said.He added that the bridge is under the authority&rsquo;s management and that they couldn&rsquo;t sit back and not only risk their lives but cause disruption of the infrastructure.&ldquo;Each bridge is considered on its merits, taking into account safety, economic and environmental factors. Soon you will get lorries wedged in the rail guards as they try to beat the jam using this bridge.&rdquo;&ldquo;These restrictions are subject to traffic regulations that restrict the use of a road, route or area to certain vehicles.&rdquo; The Kenha official said residents can petition the authority through their leaders so that they can map another safer route.This, however, caused a heavy traffic snarl-up in Thika town, forcing motorists to petition the authority to consider re-opening the bridge to ease the congestion. On Wednesday, Kenha removed the concrete barriers to ease the congestion that started in Thika town from as early as 1pm.
