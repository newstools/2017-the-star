NASA&rsquo;s leadership lineup will have no impact on Kenyan politics, West Pokot Jubilee Party leaders have said.They said the leadership structure is not new, yet the alliance kept Kenyans waiting for a long time.In the lineup Raila Odinga is flagbearer and Kalonzo Musyoka his running mate. Other co-principals will be given positions in government.&ldquo;They could have brought a new face like [ANC leader Musalia] Mudavadi. He is gambling because he is not sure if NASA will win and his position is not in the Constitution and the President has no power to create such a post. We could go back to the drawing board if it could have been Mudavadi because he is new and a sober man,&rdquo; Pokot South MP David Pkosing said.He and other leaders said JP will win by a landslide in August and garner more than 70 per cent votes.&ldquo;The Jubilee Party will automatically win. Uhuru Kenyatta floored them in the 2013 polls. Uhuru beat them when he was Deputy Prime Minister and Ruto a mere Member of Parliament, just like me. What about now when the duo are the President and Deputy President?&rdquo; Pkosing asked.Speaking to the press in Kapenguria on Tuesday, the leaders said the New NASA leadership is a waste of time and the party has no agenda for the nation.They accused the NASA principals of being unrealistic and power-hungry. &ldquo;Wamejinasa wenyewe. Kenyans wanted Raila to support a different person ... Raila has his last ammunition and he has spent it,&rdquo; Pkosing said.The NASA leaders are only interested in sharing leadership positions and they are killing the alliance by bringing Raila on board, he concluded.
