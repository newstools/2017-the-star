At least 27 people were hurt when an Aeroflot flight from Moscow to Bangkok hit a patch of severe turbulence.No injuries were life-threatening, but several passengers suffered broken bones and three needed surgery, Russian officials said.A passenger described being "hurled" up to the ceiling, trying to cling on amid shaking which "wouldn't stop".The turbulence occurred in clear skies, which meant the crew were not able to warn passengers, the airline said."The reasons behind the injures were that some of the passengers had not had their seatbelts fastened," Aeroflot said in a statement.Mobile phone footage of the aftermath of the incident showed injured people lying in the aisles, with packets of food and other items scattered on the floor."We were hurled up into the roof of the plane, it was practically impossible to hold on," a passenger who gave her first name as Yevgenia told Rossiya 24 by phone."It felt like the shaking wouldn't stop, that we would just crash," she added.The pilot, Aleksandr Ruzov, said the turbulence was "impossible to predict", in an interview with the Russia 24 news channel.He said the worst effects were felt at the back of the plane.CAT - clear air turbulence - is turbulence that occurs in otherwise calm, clear blue skies, without any visual indication such as clouds.It is caused when masses of air moving at different speeds meet, and can't be identified by the naked eye or conventional radar.Pilots use reports from other aircraft, passed on via air traffic control, to keep track of patches of clear air turbulence.
