Farmers hoarding maize in Rift Valley and Western are to blame for the shortfall and high unga prices, Agriculture CS Willy Bett and PS Richard Lesiyampe said yesterday.MPs, however, blamed millers for &ldquo;creating artificial maize flour shortfall&rdquo; by hoarding maize, leading to hiked unga prices in the market.Bett and Lesiyampe also blamed the shortage on the prolonged drought. They accused farmers of holding on to millions of bags of the produce, citing poor prices, despite the government increasing the cost of a 90kg bag to Sh3,600.The ministry bosses told the National Assembly&rsquo;s Agriculture committee that 980,000 bags of locally produced maize are in the strategic food reserve. The maize will run out by May 29.The committee chaired by Mandera North MP Adan Nooru was told the subsidised 2kg maize flour packet sold to Kenyans at Sh90 is milled from the strategic food reserve stock. &ldquo;As we speak now, farmers and households are still holding maize in North and South Rift, Bungoma and Trans Nzoia. Our farmers who grow maize have kept them in their granaries. We have a shortage of maize, that is why we are importing,&rdquo; Lesiyampe said.MP has 1,000 bagsHe said an assessment by the ministry&rsquo;s technical officers on withheld maize in February showed farmers had four million bags, while traders had 5.5 million bags. &ldquo;This is the time we assessed and realised our production was seriously depressed. We knew by the end of May we will not have enough maize and that is why we took intervention as the government because then we were working with a figure of three million Kenyans at the risk of starvation,&rdquo; Lesiyampe said.Kwanza MP Ferdinand Wanyonyi said he has been holding 1,000 bags of maize because of the poor prices in the market. Bett added that they also realised maize was withheld because traders kept on releasing the produce to the National Cereal and Produce Board whenever the government increased the price of maize per bag.He said the government&rsquo;s move to gazette a notice on April 13 allowing importation of duty free maize was to help the country get five million bags to sustain it until the next harvest.Last week 29,900 tonnes of duty free maize was imported from Durban.
