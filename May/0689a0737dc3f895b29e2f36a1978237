Voter bribery is flourishing, and both Jubilee and NASA politicians are illegally splashing cash, food, commodities and lots of inducements, the independent Elections Observation Group reported on Friday.President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s ruling Jubilee Party has been the worst offender, but NASA is number two, it says in a report released in Nairobi.It focussed on March and April, preceding and during primaries.Observers were deployed in 290 constituencies to report on bribery, intimidation, hate speech, militias, campaigning by public servants and other issues.In March, Jubilee was scored at 64 per cent (of 290 constituencies) in terms of using money, food and other commodities to lure the electorate. NASA in the same month was rated at 46 per cent.In April, Jubilee scored 76 per cent and NASA 61 per cent.In March, all other parties were ranked 52 per cent and in April 65 per cent. The Electoral Offences Act of 2016 prohibits offering directly or indirectly a bribe during an electoral period to influence a voter.During the reporting period, March and April, observers tracked the distribution of money, foodstuffs and other commodities by political parties and candidates.&ldquo;In 70 per cent constituencies, voter bribery and inducement was observed across the political divide, indicating an increase in the vice in the month of April, as compared to March,&rdquo; the report said.Observers in the 290 constituencies also found that despite the deadline for aspirants to stop dishing out money in harambees, hopefuls in 48 per cent constituencies still participate in the fundraisers.The findings were released by the Elections Observation Group, Elog, at the Sarova Stanley Hotel.The group is a long-term, permanent national platform comprised of civil society and faith-based organisations. Its mandate is to strengthen democracy in Kenya and Africa by promoting transparent and accountable electoral processes and public participation. In an ominous sign of potential violence, Elog also says politicians have recruited and armed militia groups in at least seven constituenciesIt says youth militia have been recruited, paid and equipped in Kieni in Nyeri county, Laikipia East (Lakipia county), Mathioya (Murang&rsquo;a), Butula (Busia), Nyakach (Kisumu), Uriri (Migori) and Ol Jororok (Nyandarua). Violence indicatorsMulle Musau, the national coordinator who released the report, said recruiting illegal gangs indicates potential pre- and post-election conflicts.&ldquo;In addition to intimidation and intolerance, we are tracking non-political events that could be indicators of potential conflict,&rdquo; he said. These include an increase in recruitment and arming of militia and displacement of people, he said. &ldquo;These worrying trends could lead to poor turnout during ongoing voter register verification and subsequently during the August election.&rdquo;The organisation shared the information with the NCIC, electoral commission and the police. Musau also said most civil servants, mostly in county governments, have been participating in politics, either organising political rallies for governors or campaigning for them.The election law prohibits the participation of most public officials in campaigns. The group observed an increase in this over the months of March and April. Cabinet Secretaries are not barred.In April there was an increase in violence and intolerance, abusive, and threatening language targeted at individuals and ethnic communities.
