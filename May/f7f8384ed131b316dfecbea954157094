The current maize problem could be far from over as the country is likely to have a deficit of 4.3 million bags of maize in August.The April Food Status report shows the April-July maize balance sheet states that there will be a deficit of 4.3 million bags.Dr Johnson Irungu, the director of crops from the Agriculture ministry, yesterday said this will be supplemented by the importation of five million bags of maize.&ldquo;We expect a drop in maize production due to drought, poor long rains and the armyworm infestation,&rdquo; he said.The problem has further been complicated by the fact that neighbouring countries, where Kenya traditionally imports maize from, including Uganda, Tanzania, Malawi and Zambia, also suffered severe drought.There will be a surplus of beans and wheat of 84,000 bags and 7.6 million bags respectively, while rice will have a deficit of 216,000 bags.Irungu clarified that the current maize stock of 4.5 million bags with farmers as indicated in the report is mainly for their home consumption.The report indicated that farmers are holding 4.5 million bags, while millers and traders were holding 1.2 million bags. The National Cereals and Produce Board is holding 590,000 bags. Irungu said most of the stock is for the farmers&rsquo; food needs and not for sale on the market. Only 980,000 bags are currently available until the end of the month. Last week, Agriculture PS Richard Lesiyampe appealed to farmers hoarding maize to sell to the government at a cost of Sh3,600 to help ease the current maize shortage.It has led to the skyrocketting prices of maize flour. The PS said since the announcement, no farmer has brought maize to the depots.
