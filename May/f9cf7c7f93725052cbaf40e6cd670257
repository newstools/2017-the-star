Respect from your boss isn&rsquo;t a given; you have to earn it. Start by understanding what matters to your manager. Pay close attention to their priorities and the pressures they&rsquo;re under. Next, figure out the best way to communicate with your boss, adjusting your preferred style if necessary.Does your manager like email, texts, face-to-face conversations? How often do they want to hear from you? Once a week? Once a day? Only when needed? And ask your boss how much detail they want about your work. Do they prefer you to lead with analysis or your judgement?If there is a mismatch between how you and your boss like to work &ndash; maybe you check email every hour but their inbox goes unread for days &ndash; have a candid conversation about the reasons for your preference. Discuss the situation openly and decide together how to proceed.
