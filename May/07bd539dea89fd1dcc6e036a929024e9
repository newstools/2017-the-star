The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission has been temporarily stopped from awarding the lucrative Sh2.5 billion ballot printing paper tender after a vendor moved to the Public Procurement Administrative Review Board.In a letter to IEBC&rsquo;s CEO Ezra Chiloba, the PPAR Board secretary Henock Kirungu said the electoral agency is prohibited from awarding the contract until the appeal is heard and determined.The delay in awarding the contract may pose a logistical nightmare to the Wafula Chebukati-led team because the successful bidder will have to print about 130 million ballot papers.The appeal was made by Rosecate Promotions and Supplies, a Kenyan firm eyeing the multi-billion shillings contract.&ldquo;You are hereby notified that on 9th May, 2017, a request for review was filled with the Public Procurement Administrative Review Board in respect to the above mentioned tender,&rdquo; the letter dated Tuesday reads in part.According to Section 168 of the Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act, no contract can be signed unless the appeal has been finalised. &ldquo;Upon receiving a request for a review under section 167, the secretary to the Review Board shall notify the accounting officer of a procuring entity of the pending review from the Review Board, and the suspension of the procurement proceedings in such manner as may be prescribed,&rdquo;the Act states.Fifteen firms had been invited to bid for the contract but only eight returned.They include Dubai based Al Ghurair Printing and Publishing, India&rsquo;s G.I Solutions, Kenya&rsquo;s Ellams Products Limited, UK&rsquo;s Tall Security Printing, South Africa&rsquo;s Uniprint, Eabaltijas of Lativia, Germany&rsquo;s Print Promotion and Kenya&rsquo;s Africa Infrastructure and Development Company. It&rsquo;s still not clear what grounds Rosecate Promotions and Supplies are citing in its appeal.However, there have been allegations that some IEBC staff were setting the stage to again award the contract to Al Ghurair Printing and Publishing. IEBC had awarded the Sh2.5 billion tender to Al Ghurair in October last year, but the High Court terminated the tender after Cord moved to court. &ldquo;There are forces within the IEBC who still want to derail starting the evaluation process,&rdquo; sources told the Star.
