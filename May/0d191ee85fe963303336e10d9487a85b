Mombasa police have arrested a lawyer they believe is not qualified and has conned Kenya Qatar Diaspora Sacco of Sh1.8 million. CID officers arrested Japheth Chigumba on Friday morning and said he may face several charges. A policeman who sought anonymity said they recovered several land title deeds which will be scrutinised for authenticity. One of the deeds is numbered 487 for Mwakirunge, registry map 117. It is for a 0.8 hectare property owned by Keqar Investment Company. Emmanuel Mbandi, Kenya Qatar Diaspora Sacco vice chairman, told the Star Chigumba had been on the run and that his phone had been off. He said he was shocked when he found out that the title deed they were issued was forged. "I saw large piles of titles when I visited him at his office. His office is posh," said the man who was with his lawyer Documents seen by The Star show Chigumba took the money from the sacco but he defended himself saying he is a genuine lawyer, number 4609 of 2001. “I am not aware of the fake titles. I have been doing this for a long time...no one has ever complained," he said But a source at the judiciary said the suspect has been inactive and did not take his practising certificate. The Star also established that several criminal cases have been filed against him. Mombasa Urban DCI boss Jacob Kanake said the suspect will be arraigned on Monday. “These are some of the bogus individuals who use fake indentifies to con Kenyans of large amounts of money. We have involved several government agents...a report of the same will be out next week," he said
