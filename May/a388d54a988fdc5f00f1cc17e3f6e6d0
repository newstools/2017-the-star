NASA flag-bearer Raila Odinga has asked his supporters to only vote for NASA-affiliated parties on August 8.This will boost his chances for victory and support when he becomes President, he said.Raila spoke on Saturday in Rarieda, Siaya county, during the funeral of Gladys Amollo, the mother of Rarieda ODM parliamentary candidate Otiende Amollo and nominated Senator Elizabeth Ongoro.The ODM leader said only elected leaders under NASA will implement the coalition&rsquo;s manifesto and blueprint.&ldquo;The NASA coalition has five parties &mdash; ODM, Ford Kenya, ANC, Chama Cha Mashinani and Wiper &mdash; whose candidates should be considered in the coming general election to boost my bid,&rdquo; Raila said.He slammed those who lost in the party primaries and have opted to run as independents, saying the public rejected them.&ldquo;I have constantly urged them to adhere to the wishes of the people but they have insisted on running as independent, let them not deceive you using my name to satisfy their selfish interest,&rdquo; Raila added, referring to independent candidates who have insisted they still support him for President.NASA co-principal Musalia Mudavadi said those who lost in the party primaries should shelve their ambitions and support election winners.He added that as NASA co-principals they were forced to shelve their ambitions after the select committee chose Raila as their flagbearer.&ldquo;We accepted the verdict of the select committee as much as we were all interested in being the NASA presidential flagbearer and that is why we are fully behind Raila&rsquo;s presidential bid,&rdquo; Mudavadi said.The ANC party leader insisted that their main aim is to remove the Jubilee government from power and independent candidates are bringing confusion to Raila&rsquo;s doorstep.Siaya Senator James Orengo said voters should not abandon MCA nominees in NASA as they too will boost the coalition&rsquo;s strength.He added that Raila needs a formidable team, from MCAs to the top, to knock out Jubilee in the first round.Currently, in Siaya five candidates are vying for MP as independent candidates, after claiming that they were rigged out during nominations.Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo, who lost the ODM Siaya governor polls to incumbent Cornel Rasanga, has been cleared to vie for the post as an independent.
