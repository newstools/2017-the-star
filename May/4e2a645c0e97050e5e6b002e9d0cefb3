The NASA principals are finalising strategies on how to sell their presidential candidate, just days after the Uhuru Park declaration which saw Raila Odinga announced flagbearer.The leaders, who include the former PM, Musalia Mudavadi, Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula, Kalonzo Musyoka and Isaac Rutto, were burning the midnight oil together with a technical team at Vipingo Ridge, Kilifi, yesterday.They are on a two-day retreat to plan their campaign strategy, finances, power sharing and how to beat Jubilee at the General Election. The retreat was expected to end last evening. Raila and his team are focusing on votes in their strongholds and new voters. The IEBC has announced that the country has more than 19.6 million voters. Jubilee strongholds total about 7.4 million voters, while NASA has around 8.2 million. Battleground votes total around four million votes.A source said the team is refining its campaign strategy and may address the press after they are done. &ldquo;The discussions are expected to go on until late in the evening, then Siaya Senator James Orengo, who co-chairs the technical team together with his Machakos counterpart Johnson Muthama, MPs Sakwa Bunyasi and Eseli Simiyu, will brief the media,&rdquo; the source said. The NASA leaders were with a team of experts, who include David Ndii, Dan Wameyo, Mutakha Kangu, Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana and Koitamet ole Kina. The source confirmed that the leaders are &lsquo;touching base&rsquo; and getting feedback from the ground, only days after the major declaration.&ldquo;One of the issues being discussed at length is whether the NASA principals will campaign in groupings or do it individually,&rdquo; he said. It was confirmed that they will map out the regions, looking at the vote blocs and every leader being given vote targets.
