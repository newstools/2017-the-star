The military will extend their security services in Baringo and Laikipia counties for 30 more days to ensure sanity is fully restored.Provincial Regional Coordinator Francis Munyambu said the government renewed declaration of areas mapped as dangerous and disturbed areas to restore peace in the troubled areas.&ldquo;Last week, Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery renewed the declaration for the troubled areas for 30 more days. He made the announcement last week after reviewing the peace restoration exercise for the last one month,&rdquo; he told journalists in Nakuru yesterday.Munyambu said security agencies have achieved 75 per cent of what they had expected, hence the extension.&ldquo;We realised we are not done as we expected. We started the operations in the areas in March and we intend to achieve 100 per cent as we go back to the exercise," he said.However, security in the two counties has greatly improved since they started the crackdown on raiders, Munyambu said.The government has recovered 12 AK 47 rifles and more than 100 bullets, and 269 people have been arrested for either trespassing or illegal grazing, while 15,000 livestock have been removed from farms in Laikipia county, he said.Munyambu added that in Baringo, the government has recovered three AK 47 guns and more than 2,000 goats.He said there are hiccups in a few areas such as Loruk, Kagiri, Yatia, Kabartonjo and Ngaratuk Chemoe in Baringo North, and Chebinyinyi, Kasilea, Kiserian and Lugus in Baringo South. &ldquo;We want to clean and finish sanitising security in the two counties,&rdquo; Munyambu said.
