Several Embu MCAs who lost in the nominations have blamed their woes on “evil schemers”, the incumbent county administration fearing scrutiny and land grabbers. The MCAs who will run as independents say they didn’t lose in the nominations democratically. They claimed their loss was planned in advance by people who feared their return to the assembly would curtail their “illegal operations”. They are led by assembly deputy speaker Ibrahim Swaleh. Mavuria MCA Joseph Mwaniki said in Maendeleo Chap Chap, the purported opinion polls were conducted by officials out to pick their preferred candidates. Mwaniki, who is the assembly’s Budget and Appropriations Committee chairman, is running as an independent. “It was not my wish to vie as a “lone ranger”, without a political vehicle on which to sell my leadership ideologies, but circumstances forced me to ditch Maendeleo Chap Chap,” he said. Swaleh, lost the Kirimari JP primaries to Morris Muchiri. Swaleh and Mwaniki said they were removed in the primaries through underhand ploys orchestrated by some incumbents, who feared scrutiny from the county assembly.
