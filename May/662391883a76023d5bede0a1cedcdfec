Lamu East residents have complained that Cabro pavements built by the county government are eating up the soles of their shoes and sandals.They want the pavements removed to save them the trouble of replacing them.Mohamed Shosi said on Tuesday that in as much as they are grateful to the county for the installation, they feel it is a luxury they cannot afford.Shosi noted it is expensive to replace the shoes which wear out faster than when the streets were not paved."We are not saying the pavements are not good but people are complaining that their shoes are wearing out much faster," he said."Therefore, we want the Cabro blocks removed. We feel our complaints are genuine and should be considered."The residents have threatened to take matters into their own hands and destroy the pavements if the county government doesn&rsquo;t act.The county spent a considerable sum of money installing the pavements in towns and some villages in a to ease movement.It has also installed street lights in twons prone to crime.However, shopkeepers have also complained that the street lights have reduced the number of people buying torches."Before street lights were installed, I used to make good money selling torches and other lighting appliances," Abdulrahman Sifa said."Since the street lights were erected, the sales are bad. We can't do anything or complain but it is hurting us,"
