An Elgeyo Marakwet clinical officer has been released on a Sh20,000 bond by an Iten court after she failed to testify.Noella Tuigong, an officer at Iten County Referral Hospital, was charged with contempt of court after failing to appear in court to give evidence in a defilement case.Last week, prosecutor Wanjiku Karanja sought a warrant of arrest after informing the court the clinical officer was served with witness summons on May 10, but she declined to honour them.Tuigong denied the charges, saying she was not served and that she did not write a clinical report in the defilement case.&ldquo;I need to confirm whether the clinical notes purported to be filled by me were actually filled by me. That is not even my handwriting,&rdquo; she told the court.The prosecution told the court the accused had told the investigating officer she would not appear in court. &ldquo;In respect to the treatment notes, the witness dully filled the same despite having failed to sign the same so she is rightly before the court,&rdquo; the prosecutor said. The case will be mentioned on June 13. Tuigong was to testify in a case where Mark Biwott was charged with attempting to defile a minor on December 10, 2014.
