Former Devolution CS Anne Waiguru&rsquo;s bid for Kirinyaga governor took a new twist after Parliament adopted an NYS report recommending she be barred from holding public office over the Sh1.8 billion theft.The National Assembly, in an afternoon session presided over by Speaker Justin Muturi, yesterday voted to adopt the report for Waiguru to be subjected to further investigations and a lifestyle audit.Most senior ex-Devolution officials, including PS Peter Mangiti, NYS director general Nelson Githinji and his deputy Aden Harakhe face charges over the 2015 theft, except Waiguru because investigations have not directly linked her to the scandal.However, the Public Accounts Committee chaired by Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo wants Waiguru to be barred from holding public office for &ldquo;personally plotting and executing&rdquo; the scandal.The scam was initially Sh791 million, but Auditor General Edward Ouko&rsquo;s special audit revealed that Sh1.8 billion was lost. &ldquo;The former CS should be further investigated and charged for supervising looting of public funds,&rdquo; the report, passed without any amendments reads.Its passage spells doom for Waiguru&rsquo;s political aspirations because anyone can go to court to challenge her clearance by the EACC.
