Only 20 private pharmacies countrywide have been approved to sell HIV self-testing kits.The outlets are based in Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu, which means Kenyans in other regions will have to wait longer because retailers must comply with set guidelines before they are allowed to sell the kits.Each kit retails for Sh750 and can only be used for a single test.HIV activists urged the government to create a budget for the kits so they are made available in public hospitals.&ldquo;We need people in villages and in slums to have access to these kits, but the price is too high,&rdquo; said Peter Mogere, an advocacy fellow with the Aids Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, which is an HIV prevention lobby with offices in Nairobi.The kits were launched early this month by Medical Services director Jackson Kioko.Within one year, the government plans to reach out to 400,000 Kenyans who do not know their HIV status so they can undertake self-testing.Kenya is the first country in the world to introduce the kits in the market.Studies done on self-testing kits have shown the results are 80 per cent accurate.&ldquo;HIV self-testing will complement other existing HIV testing approaches. It should lead to medication if the person is positive,&rdquo; said Dr Elizabeth Irungu, an HIV researcher involved in the ongoing rollout of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).The two spoke to journalists in Nairobi at a conference organised by Avac and Internews.&ldquo;Once you take the test at home, ensure you go to a health facility to confirm your result,&rdquo; Martin Sirengo, head of the National Aids and STIs Control Programme, said on May 4.About 1.5 million people are living with HIV in Kenya and nearly one million are on life-long treatment.PrEP refers to treatment in which HIV negative people take daily pills to prevent infection.It is said to be 96 per cent effective in minimising new infections.It is supposed to be taken by people who are at high risk of contracting the virus, especially discordant couples.Others eligible for the treatment are individuals who do not use condoms and those who frequently contract STIs.People with multiple sexual partners, drug addicts who share syringes and people who frequently use post-exposure prophylaxis qualify for the drug.Kenya is the second country in Africa after South Africa to roll-out Prep.PrEP users are advised to practice safe sex.
