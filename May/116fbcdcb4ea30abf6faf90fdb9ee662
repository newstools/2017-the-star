The NASA bosses yesterday threatened not to participate in the August elections if an appeal by the IEBC goes through.The electoral agency is disputing a ruling by the High Court, which stated that results announced at the constituency tallying centres will be valid to determine winners.The NASA leaders said they will not accept the ruling being overturned. They spoke in Afraha Stadium, Nakuru county. &ldquo;We will not allow the IEBC or Jubilee to tamper with the vote,&rdquo; NASA flagbearer and ODM leader Raila Odinga said. Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka urged Nakuru residents to be ready, if called upon, to take to the streets to protest should the ruling be overturned. &ldquo;If the appeal goes through, will you be ready to protest?&rdquo; Kalonzo asked.He said the IEBC and the Jubilee administration should accept the earlier ruling, adding that it is now law.Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama dared the state to arrest him for declaring that if the ruling is overturned, the alliance would disrupt voting in polling stations countrywide.&ldquo;I dare Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery to come for me, but we are saying that if the ruling is overturned, the election will not happen,&rdquo; he said.Other leaders who spoke at the rally faulted the Jubilee administration over the skyrocketting prices of basic commodities, including maize flour, milk and sugar.ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi accused the Jubilee administration of being insensitive, saying they only acted after matters got out of hand.He said the consignment of maize that docked in Mombasa on Friday from Mexico will not help alleviate food scarcity as the country is already facing starvation.Bungoma Senator and Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula said the shortage of food being experienced across the county is by design to benefit some individuals within the government. &ldquo;A government that commits economic crimes on its people does not deserve to be called a government,&rdquo; Wetang&rsquo;ula said.Chama Cha Mashinani leader Isaac Rutto, who has been waging a war against DP Ruto in his backyard, accused the state of planning to rig the election by using funds acquired from high prices of food items.He questioned the speed with which the consignment of maize arrived in the country after the plans to import the commodity were announced. &ldquo;How quickly did the maize arrive from Mexico? Is Mexico in Kisii county,&rdquo; Rutto asked.
