Some Marakwet West residents have expressed outrage, accusing a state agency of ignoring their views in the construction of a Sh30 billion dam.Locals of Kipsaiya, where the multipurpose dam is set to be established, say the Kerio Valley Development Authority is being used by some politicians for selfish reasons.Edward Yego questioned why the KVDA is rushing to form an implementation committee even before an Environmental Impact Assessment test on the project has been concluded. &ldquo;We are told some are being promised cars and land to campaign for the project. Why should KVDA promise people goodies if this is a clean deal?&rdquo; Yego said.He said 488 landowners may be displaced if the project kicks off.Yego said the state agency is using local administrators, including the deputy county commissioner and chiefs, to force residents to accept the project.The residents told the press in Eldoret town on Friday that the National Land Commission has not been involved in the project as was the case in the standard gauge railway project.&ldquo;This is our ancestral land and we ask the government to construct the dam somewhere in the escarpment, where residents will not be evicted,&rdquo; Yego said. Another resident, Edwin Yego, said KVDA has been silent on the compensation the affected locals will receive when they are displaced.Residents were not asked whether they need a dam in the first place, Yego said.He said it makes no economic sense for the state to displace 488 landowners living on fertile land and leaving an escarpment that is not inhabited to continue lying idle. &ldquo;As residents, we have not asked the state to give us a dam. We fail to understand why it wants to set up a project against our will,&rdquo; Yego said.
