The Nairobi County government has waived advertising fees on billboards and parking for the World Under-18 athletics Championships slated for July.Advertising fees placed on billboards within the vicinity of the championship and on the outskirts of the city will not attract levies, according to the governor.Making the announcement yesterday, Nairobi governor Evans Kidero, said the move is to ensure visibility for the championships and to enhance the host city campaign in a bid to ensure a successful five-day championship.&ldquo;This is big event not only for the city of Nairobi but for the country at large and I would like to encourage all the city residents to attend the event and cheer our athletes,&rdquo; added Kidero.The Nairobi City boss said all city hotels had been booked for the duration of the event hence they expect to generate income of close to Sh50 million from the five-day championship.&ldquo;With the hotels booked and with transportation and the food they will consume, we are expecting to make Sh50 million from the event from all aspects of the championship and the city of Nairobi is ready to put on a world class show,&rdquo; he added.Kidero urged the visitors to the championships to visit various social amenities such as the Nairobi National Park and sample the best cuisine from the various eateries and hotels across the city. &ldquo;There is a lot to see and enjoy in this great city of Nairobi and I am asking the athletes and officials from the various countries to enjoy their stay in Nairobi.&rdquo;He asked city residents to keep the city clean in readiness for arrivals of the 2000 athletes and officials from 160 countries. Kidero noted that security will be beefed up during the championship. World Under-18 athletics Championships Local Organising Committee chief executive officer, Mwangi Muthee, said 80 percent of the preparations are almost complete with less than a month to go to the extravaganza.&ldquo;We are 80 percent done and the athletes hostels at Kenyatta University are complete,&rdquo; added Muthee. &ldquo;The remaining 20 percent is the laying of the tartan track at Kasarani which starts this week and will be completed in the next fortnight,&rdquo; he said.By mid June, Muthee said the track will be ready for use. &ldquo; We are laying the track with utmost speed to ensure we are ready by mid June,&rdquo; added Muthee. He was, however, non committal on whether they will host a dry run for the event before the championship. &ldquo;At the moment, we are unsure because we have not received communication from International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) on the matter but we will still proceed whether we have it or not,&rdquo; added Muthee.Muthee added that scholars who plant indigenous trees in their schools will win 50 tickets for the championship.A final inspection team led by IAAF chief executive officer Olivier Gers is expected in the country in the next fortnight alongside competitions director Paul Hardy.
