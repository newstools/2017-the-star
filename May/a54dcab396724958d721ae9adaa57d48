Boniface Mulwa, 30, said he started experiencing pain in his upper jaw in March, and a growth started developing. The growth is almost covering his right eye completely. "I have sought medical help from Kitui Level 4 Hospital and Machakos Level 5 Hospital and I was referred to Aga Khan University Hospital for a thorough medical examination. I have been unable to go for the check up because it is too expensive. So far, I have spent more than Sh100,000 trying to seek medical help, but my condition is worsening by the day," he said.Mulwa, an orphan, said his wife and three children abandoned him once they realised his condition was deteriorating.His brother Kyalo said the family has sold all it can to raise funds for Mulwa. "All we can do now is pray that God sends a well-wisher to help save his life," he said.Mulwa can be reached through mobile number 0723221103.
