Bungoma Jubilee Party Senate candidate Juma Mukhwana has been cleared by the IEBC to run.He said he is not scared of Senator Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula&rsquo;s bid to defend his seat.Mukhwana spoke on Monday after he was cleared by the electoral agency.He said he is prepared to &ldquo;show Wetang&rsquo;ula dust&rdquo; in August. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy to have been cleared to participate in this election. I&rsquo;m confident of beating my rivals in a landslide,&rsquo;&rsquo; Mukhwana said.He said Wetang&rsquo;ula has failed residents by concentrating on fighting the government, instead of bringing development into the county.&lsquo;&rsquo;We&rsquo;re tired of being in the opposition and that&rsquo;s why Bungoma will vote Jubilee back in,&rsquo;&rsquo; Mukhwana said.He said he is going to change the politics of Bungoma to one based on issues. &lsquo;&rsquo;We call upon the IEBC to ensure the election is free and credible,&rdquo; he said.Wetang&rsquo;ula is expected to relinquish his seat, in the event that NASA forms the next government, to take the position of deputy prime minister.Early this month, Mukhwana dismissed Wetang&rsquo;ula&rsquo;s reelection bid, saying it was a slap in the faces of residents who believed their leader had carved out a niche in national politics. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t Wetang&rsquo;ula launch a presidential bid that saw youths die ,only to vie for senator?&rdquo; he asked.Others in the race are ANC&rsquo;s David Makali and ODM&rsquo;s Bonny Nyongesa.
