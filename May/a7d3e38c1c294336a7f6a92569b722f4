Former chief registrar of the Judiciary Gladys Shollei and seven others were yesterday charged afresh with abuse of office in connection with more than Sh150 million allegedly for the construction of the prefabricated court buildings in Tawa, Mavoko and Garsen without approval of the tender committee.She was charged alongside former deputy registrar Kakai Kissinger, Martin Okwata, Benedict Omollo, Nicholas Okwemwa, Nicholas Mbeba, Thomas Atak and Wycliff Obunde.The accused were charged after trial magistrate Liz Gicheha allowed the Director of Public Prosecutions to amend some details and sections of the charge sheet. Shollei (pictured) won the Jubilee ticket in the Uasin Gishu county woman representative race last month.The court heard that on January 17, 2013, in the Nairobi county, the accused, being employees of the Judiciary, jointly failed to comply with the law relating to procurement, by unilaterally increasing the advance down payment for construction of court buildings from 10 per cent to 50 per cent.
