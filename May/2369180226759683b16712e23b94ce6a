Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero has kicked off plans to safeguard more than 100,000 Kamba votes.The Kamba community overwhelmingly voted for Kidero and Deputy Governor Jonathan Mueke (pictured) in 2013. But analysts say the entry of Senator Mike Sonko, Jubilee&rsquo;s candidate who comes from the community, could split the vote and deny Kidero victory in August. Kidero and Mueke on Tuesday met more than 100 elders from the community in a hotel. NASA co-principal Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula attended the event. Kamba Council of Elders chairman Sam Mumbi said they endorsed the duo for a second term, promising to fight off any threat by Sonko.&ldquo;We, as the elders from the Kamba community, are fully behind you and pledge to convince our community to vote for you again,&rdquo; he said. There is a battle for the populous Kamba vote, which observers say could swing the outcome.In 2013, Sonko garnered more than 800,000 votes. He got more votes than President Uhuru Kenyatta, on whose party Sonko ran on. Kidero and NASA have retained Mueke as the running mate to cement the Kamba vote.
