A 45-year-old Lugari man stabbed and seriously injured three of his family members after he failed to receive his portion of ugali.The incident occurred at Kiwanja Ndege village on Friday evening.Jotham Ahada stabbed his wife Beatrice Kanaya in the chest five times, before attacking her aunt when she tried to separate them. He also stabbed his son before fleeing.Trouble began when Ahada returned home and did not find ugali - his favourite meal - and quarelled with his wife before he picked a kitchen knife and stabbed her when he was overpowered.Speaking to the press from her hospital bed at Lumakanda Subcounty Hospital where she was rushed by neighbours, Kanaya said the family had spent the day working on the farm, and they only took a cup of porridge each at about 4pm, which served as both lunch and supper because they had no food left in the house.When Ahada returned in the evening, he demanded he be given ugali and when he was told there was none he became &lsquo;wild&rsquo;.&ldquo;This man never provides for the family. Whenever he gets a little money, he goes drinking. I have to work on other residents&rsquo; farms for us to get something to put on the table. Now that I was working on our farm, I couldn&rsquo;t manage to get cash to buy food,&rdquo; the mother of five said.
