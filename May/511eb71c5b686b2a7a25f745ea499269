Former Judiciary Registrar Gladys Shollei on Friday said she is qualified to vie for any political office, despite the abuse of office charges she faces in court.Shollei said she has not been convicted and that the law is clear on the matter. She said she cannot be barred by the IEBC from contesting for the Uasin Gishu woman representative position.&ldquo;I am a lawyer. I taught at the university for over 10 years, and I am one of the best lawyers. I could not have made the decision if I knew the law stops me from contesting,&rdquo; she said in Eldoret town.On Thursday, Shollei walked out of an interview with NTV&rsquo;s Jane Ngoiri, when she was asked about integrity issues.Shollei says even those convicted of criminal offences and are appealing cannot be barred by the polls agency.&ldquo;Even Ezra Chiloba is the IEBC chief executive yet a parliamentary committee recommended he is unfit to hold public office,&rdquo; she said.
