IF he had been born into a different family, and had the opportunity to develop his gifts in a different direction, I believe that Raila Odinga may well have &ldquo;brought home&rdquo; a Nobel Prize for Literature. This would have been in his capacity as one of Africa&rsquo;s greatest dramatists, who would have had a string of highly influential plays to his credit.For, say what you will about him, this man knows how to craft an effective narrative. And it is persuasive narratives rather than a limitless supply of cash that determine how Kenyans will vote.Many who are preparing to work in his cause day and night &ndash; now that &ldquo;the whistle has been blown&rdquo;, so to speak &ndash; will be doing so out of a conviction that the affairs of this country have been criminally mismanaged by the Jubilee government.Suppose Raila had won in 2013. Are we to believe that there would have been no scandal over the standard gauge railway? That there would have been plentiful and cheap maize flour?Raila himself may well be more interested in building a great political legacy than in amassing ever-greater wealth. But nobody ascends to the presidency alone, and among the cast of crucial supporters for any successful president there will always be those who see their victory as bringing forth, &ldquo;our turn to eat&rdquo;.There is not that much difference between the two men, except in that Uhuru tends to have a better- funded and more efficient campaign machine; while Raila is the greater storyteller &ndash; the man uniquely equipped to persuade millions of potential voters that he can lead them to the Promised Land.If there is one thing that worked against Raila in the 2013 presidential election, it was the story &ndash; totally false, but very persuasively told &ndash; that he had somehow had a hand in delivering Uhuru Kenyatta and William Ruto to the ICC.Well, now the shoe is on the other foot. And it is Raila&rsquo;s story &ndash; painting the Jubilee government (quite unfairly) as a mediocre, non-inclusive and wasteful kleptocracy &ndash; which may well prove to be effective.For as the British political theorist Richard Hooker, pointed out centuries ago, &ldquo;He that goeth about to persuade a multitude that they are not so well governed as they ought to be shall never want attentive and favourable hearers.&rdquo;
