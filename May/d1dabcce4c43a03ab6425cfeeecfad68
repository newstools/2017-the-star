Poor households, still reeling from the soaring price of unga, suffered another blow on Sunday after the price of kerosene went up by Sh0.90. Motorists will pay an extra Sh1.59 over the next month in new fuel prices announced yesterday. Strivers in Nairobi, mostly in the slum and informal settlements, will have to fork out Sh65.28 for kerosene. However, the price of diesel, largely used in commercial transport, farming and manufacturing, has dropped by Sh0.57 in the monthly review by the Energy Regulatory Commission. A litre of petrol in Nairobi will now cost Sh99.59 up from Sh98.00. Diesel will trade at Sh88.05, down from Sh88.62, while kerosene will trade at Sh65.28, an increase from Sh64.38. In Mombasa, a litre of petrol will cost Sh96.32 up from Sh94.73, diesel will retail at Sh84.79, a decrease from Sh85.63, while kerosene will retail at Sh62.52 up from Sh61.58 per litre. Mandera residents will continue paying the highest price for the commodities due to their distance from the Port of Mombasa, where the commodity lands. Super petrol in the Northern Kenya town will retail at Sh113.40 up from Sh111.96 per litre. Diesel will go for Sh101.86 from Sh102.56, and Kerosene will retail at Sh79.09 up from Sh78.29 per litre.
