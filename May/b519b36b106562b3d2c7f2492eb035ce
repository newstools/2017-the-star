KenGen has barred the Pokot community from building a secondary school within its premises, but residents want this rescinded. Leaders, led by Kapenguria MP Samuel Moroto (pictured), on Saturday said the community has not benefitted from KenGen and urged the government to solve the row between the community and the company. Moroto said KenGen stopped construction of the school, which could have accommodated students and eradicated cattle rustling.He said the work should be part of KenGen&rsquo;s corporate social responsibility and if that cannot happen, the the firm should vacate. &ldquo;KenGen has been a nuisance. It&rsquo;s not implementing any CSR activity. It stopped funding our children&rsquo;s education. It should just vacate if it&rsquo;s not going to help,&rdquo; Moroto said during a peace meeting with Turkanas in Turkwel, adding that the firm is managed poorly. He told Energy CS Charles Keter to visit them before residents protest. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve agreed as Pokot leaders that we&rsquo;ll not even allow electricity from Turkwel to Tullow oil company. We&rsquo;ll block all roads and demonstrate for our rights,&rdquo; the legislator said, giving KenGen a one-week ultimatum to allow the construction to resume, failing which, they will go on with construction .Sigor MP Philip Rotino accused KenGen of becoming bossy and stopping help to the community. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve not constructed even a health centre. We regret donating our land,&rdquo; he added. School principal Elijah Obach said the project has stalled for three months after KenGen told them to vacate. He said the school was located within the company&rsquo;s site because of insecurity. &ldquo;We were given Sh500,000 from the CDF to construct the school, after grading the ground, KenGen and GSU officers stopped the construction&rdquo; Obach said.
