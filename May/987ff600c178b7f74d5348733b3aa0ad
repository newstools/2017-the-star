Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto has asked Kalenjins to ditch Jubilee Party, which has "made false promises" and support NASA in the election.The Chama Cha Mashinani leader said it was sad that President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto have returned after abandoning the community and failing to fulfill 2013 pledges.Rutto noted the region's voters backed the two to the last man in the last general election."We have shifted base to Raila Odinga's camp because of unfulfilled promises and high-handedness of the ruling elite," said the NASA co-principal."They have only resurfaced now because they want to be re-elected. They are in a panic mode due to the mass exodus of voters."He spoke at Narok West MP aspirant Gabriel Tongoyo's campaign launch at Lekanga, Narok on Wednesday. MPs Patrick Ntutu (Narok West) and Johana Ng'eno (Emurua Dikirr), Narok woman representative aspirant Lydia Ntimama and deputy governor aspirant Weldon Rop also attended the function.The Governor said the Jubilee leaders are only go to the region for political supremacy battles, not to launch mega projects.He apologised to the community for leading campaigns for Uhuru and Ruto in 2013."The Jubilee administration should be sent home with immediate effect because they have failed Kenyans. Let us back the NASA team which will save Kenyans from the bondage of poverty," he said.Read: Rutto's sudden jump to NASA complicates his reelection bidRutto warned the Jubilee administration against interfering with IEBC in the management of the August 8 general election."There are clear indications that Jubilee is out to meddle with the management of the electoral process with the intention of rigging," he said. "The electorate should be left to elect leaders of their choice without manipulation."The NASA Pentagon member further said they will guard against rigging from the polling station all the way to the tallying centre."Jubilee should not attempt monkey business as it will have serious repercussions," he said.Ng'eno alleged a plot to rig the elections using the provincial administrators."We have heard that sub-county administrators have been told by the government to get prepared for the polls. They are the ones who will be used to rig the election," he said.Ntutu, who is vying for Narok governor on a CCM ticket, said the maize shortage is one of the signs of Jubilee's poor development record."The failure of the government to provide farmers with subsidies and other incentives, to spur food production, has negatively affected food reserves."Tongoyo pledged to unite all communities living and ensure resources are fairly distributed.
