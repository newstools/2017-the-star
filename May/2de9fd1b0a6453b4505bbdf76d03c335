Residents of Mavoko subcounty have told off Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua, urging him to stop wasting time looking for votes in the area.They said the cosmopolitan constituency is a NASA stronghold and he is destined to fail with his Maendeleo Chap Chap party.&ldquo;There is no way we can be duped to vote for Mutua again. He sidelined Mavoko immediately we voted him as governor in 2013. Why is he reaching out to us for votes now?&rdquo; a resident said.Mutua ended his political rally at Mavoko Stadium in Athi River town prematurely after the public turned wild on Saturday.They booed at him, shouting Wiper and NASA, whenever he said Maendeleo Chap Chap.The residents said there is nothing much Mutua&rsquo;s leadership has done to improve their lives, despite the fact that they remit taxes to the county government. On his way to Athi River town, Mutua received a hostile reception at KAPA, the Gateway Mall area and in Mlolongo town. The sand dealers at Gateway Mall attempted to pelt the governor&rsquo;s motorcade with stones when he tried to address them.He sped off without addressing them. Mutua blamed his ordeal on Wiper politicians, whom he accused of inciting the public against him. He said his political rival Wavinya Ndeti and Mavoko MP Patrick Makau were behind his misfortunes. Mutua urged the residents to consider reelecting him. He said his development track record outshines other governors&rsquo; across the country.The incident occurred barely three hours after Athi River deputy county commissioner Geoffrey Omoding warned politicians against inciting locals against their opponents.Speaking during a peace walk, Omoding said all political aspirants have constitutional rights to traverse the subcounty lobbying for votes from the electorate.
