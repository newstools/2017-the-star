Unep will set up an African regional geothermal hub in Kenya as a centre of excellence for the rest of the world. African Rift Geothermal Development Facility programme manager Meseret Zemedkun said Kenya has successfully adopted renewable energy sources. “Kenya will be the main hub of the African region in terms of capacity building of geothermal technology. This is also the main achievement because they have built a very good experience and capacity. They can share their best practices with the rest of the world,” she said. Zemedkun spoke during a tour of GDC projects in the Menengai Crater on Saturday. “Kenya has developed a coherent geothermal policy anchored on the Geothermal Act, which strengthens public and private partnership in developing the renewable energy power project. The African Centre of Excellence will be set up in Nakuru county,” she said. The hub will be fully operational by next year. It will be used for capacity-building of geothermal technology. Unep will provide technical support.
