RAILA Odinga's popularity has been on the rise for months now and this was expected to escalate after he was named the NASA presidential candidate.From where I stand, his popularity should even be more than 40 per cent as we in NASA are now a united team.Previously, our members in all the affiliate parties were somehow disgruntled because we had no flagbearer to identify with, unlike our competitors in the Jubilee Party, which already had President Uhuru Kenyatta as their candidate and Deputy President William Ruto as the running mate.It is now worth noting that all factors are working together for NASA.And apart from NASA putting its house in order, another thing that has catalyzed Raila's, and, by extension, NASA's, popularity, is how he and the rest of the team have been able to remain steadfast in the fight to address the needs of the ordinary mwanachi. Raila and other NASA leaders have been very categorical on spiralling corruption, the high cost of living and unemployment that our counterparts on the other side are completely unable to address. Therefore, in the remaining 82 days, Raila&rsquo;s ratings will rise even further.No Kenyan will support a regime that has made life completely unbearable for the common wananchi.These latest ratings should send a message to Uhuru and Ruto: The writing is on the wall and their time is up.Kenyans are sick and tired with their poor leadership. It is on this regime&rsquo;s watch that Kenyans have accumulated a huge national debt. Uhuru has over-borrowed, burdening us, our grandchildren and our great grandchildren, with debt. So Kenyans are giving up on this regime, hence the support they are now giving to Raila and NASA.Raila has never given up fighting for the rights of all Kenyans. He has never taken an easy route to the top. His many years in detention did not slow him down or stop him from working for Kenyans. Raila has the country&rsquo;s interests at heart and that is why many Kenyans are identifying with him now more than ever.Raila has also been received well in some of the perceived Jubilee strongholds, including Meru, Kiambu, Nakuru, Murang&rsquo;a and Nyandarua. The NASA brigade has doubled their energies in campaigning in these regions and you can see the fruit.He is the right person to lead the country.Kajwang is the Senator from Homa Bay
