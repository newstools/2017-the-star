MPs are under pressure to enact a key legislation seeking to align the administrative structure of Parliament with the 2010 Constitution.Parliament is supposed to pass the pending Parliamentary Service Bill 2017, which repeals and re-enacts the Parliamentary Service Act, 2000. The proposed law is a constitutionally bound bill as it seeks to operationalise the Act in tandem with the principles of the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution.The schedule provided for a period of five years for any legislation required to implement the Constitution, but the Parliamentary Service Commission is yet to achieve this. Although this period was subsequently extended by the House, the Parliamentary Service Act 2000 needs this review to comply with requirements of the Fifth Schedule.
