Independent candidates in Trans Nzoia have formed an alliance to campaign together and decide which presidential candidate they will back.More than 100 independents will meet on Monday next week as the Okoa Trans Nzoia Team.They plan to stop Governor Patrick Khaemba (Ford Kenya), his Jubilee Party opponent Kakau Bisau and other party aspirants from winning in the region.&ldquo;We will meet to develop a common manifesto, agenda and platform for our campaigns in Trans Nzoia,&rdquo; senator hopeful Ken Wafula said.He is the convener of the group.There are about 100 independents, far more than Ford K and Jubilee candidates combined, who are 72 in total.Three of the independents are vying for governor, two for senator, 15 for MP and many for MCA posts.The third force in trans nzoia&ldquo;We want to forge a strong third force that will seek to incorporate other candidates from small like-minded parties,&rdquo; Wafula said.During their meeting next week they will discuss whether to back NASA&rsquo;s Raila Odinga or incumbent Uhuru Kenyatta (JP) for President.&ldquo;Our campaign will be issue-based. We will seek to deal with issues like ADC land, which is under threat of grabbing by certain powerful forces, and Sikhendu Forest land allocations during the Moi regime,&rdquo; Wafula said.Many are running as independents following what they term disorganisation and/or unfairness in primaries.
