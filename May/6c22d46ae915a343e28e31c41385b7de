Baringo Senator Gideon Moi has dismissed allegations that he supports Pokot bandits wreaking havoc in the county.He said he "has never and will never become a cattle rustler" adding that he cannot be a supporter of insecurity acts.In his Tugen dialect, he said: "Monomey ng'wonet ole momi korotik, (poison does not stream in a surface without blood)".He urged the warring Pokot, Ilchamus, Tugen, Marakwet and Turkana pastoral communities to stop armed raids and coexist in peace.The senator also condoled with the family of the Eldoret MCA aspirant whose three children were murdered and dumped in River Nzoia.Bodies of three sons of James Ratemo (Kapsoya ward aspirant) were retrieved from the river on Thursday."We urge the police to conduct speedy investigations into the deaths and arrest the perpetrators," Moi said on Saturday.Clifford (seven), Glen (three) and Taya (five) were reported missing last Saturday.
