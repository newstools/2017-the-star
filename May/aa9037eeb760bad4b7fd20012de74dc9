EACC officers are tracing more than Sh100 million suspected to have been stolen or diverted from Nandi county and hidden in the houses of top officials. Sources said county officials had been hurrying to pay bills and in the process cash from the county coffers has been diverted within the last three months. Sources said the probe in Nandi involves more than Sh2 billion allegedly misused by officers in the last two years. MPs Alfred Keter (Nandi Hills) and Oscar Sudi (Kapseret) have asked the EACC to ensure prosecution of those who have misused funds. “There has been serious looting of public resources in Nandi,” Keter said. Detectives are looking for eight seniors officers for questioning. Most of them are suspected to be hiding the stolen cash in their houses. EACC detectives on Friday night arrested Roads chief officer Alex Buigut and recovered Sh5.7 million in cash from his house in Langas estate, Eldoret. EACC deputy director Enock Otiko said the officials will be prosecuted for the loss of funds. Governor Cleophas Lagat lost in the Jubilee primaries to Senator Stephen Sang, who had been on the forefront of questioning how more than Sh12.5 billion allocated to the county had been used.
