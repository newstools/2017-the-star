The race for the Nakuru governor seat will be bruising following Kinuthia Mbugua&rsquo;s declaration he will run as an independent.He lost in the Jubilee Party primaries to former NTSA chairman Lee Kinyanjui. Other aspirants include nominated Senator Paul Njoroge (Kanu), Peter Koros (CCM), John Mututho and Senator James Mungai (both independent candidates).Mbugua termed the JP primaries &ldquo;shambolic&rdquo;.&ldquo;It is clear the primaries were rigged. They were marred by irregularities and did not reflect the will of the people. That is why I will stand for the same seat as an independent candidate,&rdquo; he said after losing the polls.Mbugua will start shopping for a running mate before the official campaign period, which starts on May 28.Deputy Governor Joseph Ruto, who has had a close working relationship with his boss, said he will not join Mbugua.&ldquo;I have decided to remain in Jubilee despite my governor&rsquo;s loss. The governor has wished me well. I pray he succeeds in his endeavours. We will still engage in other issues,&rdquo; he said.Mungai, popularly known as Jaymo, denied holding talks with other independents to front one candidate for the seat.&ldquo;I have not and will not hold any talks with other independent candidates. Their ideologies are different. I will proceed with my governor bid. If the others have to form an association, let them go ahead,&rdquo; he said.Kinyanjui picked Dr Erick Korir, a Kuresoi South chemist, as his running mate. Korir is a PhD holder in chemistry from University of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa. He has worked as a lecturer.Njoroge has chosen Enock Karama as his running mate.On Monday, Mututho, who was a distant third during the Jubilee primaries, said he has been spearheading talks to front one candidate against Kinyanjui since Friday.&ldquo;We are looking to support the strongest candidates to face it off with those who won the Jubilee nominations. We will form an association,&rdquo; he said.
