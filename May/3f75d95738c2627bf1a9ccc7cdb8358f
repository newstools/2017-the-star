President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday urged China to ensure a win-win situation as Kenya formally joined Beijing’s Sh15 trillion Silk Road infrastructure initiative. He said Kenya and Africa will benefit more if China can, when implementing projects, transfer skills and set up manufacturing companies in the continent — instead of providing cash and using mostly Chinese workers to undertake the massive projects. Kenya, like all the other 67 countries involved in the project, will have to pitch for funds for various infrastructure projects from the initiative. “It will be a win-win situation when our people have the skills, assets and financing necessary to participate in the development of the infrastructure that will support trade and reduce the cost of doing business,” Uhuru said. “This will secure the good jobs we all want, and protect us all from the burden of imprudent debt,” he said. Uhuru addressed 27 presidents who are attending the Belt and Road Initiative launched by China in 2013. Some Western diplomats have expressed unease about the summit and the plan as a whole, seeing it as an attempt to project a more assertive Chinese influence globally. They are concerned about transparency and access for foreign firms to the scheme. India, for example, did not attend, as the project runs through the disputed region of Indian-administered Kashmir. Chinese President Xi Jinping has touted his Silk Road plan, as a new way to boost global development, expanding links between Asia, Africa, and Europe and beyond, underpinned by trillions in infrastructure investment. Yesterday, Uhuru said if the initiative was to create prosperity, sustainability and inclusivity for all peoples in the 68 countries, China should ensure better coordination, better connectivity of facilities, fair and unimpeded trade and financial integration. The President said Kenya agreed to join the initiative because the countries share a deep historical bond This started in the 15the century after the visit by Chinese Admiral Zheng He to the Kenyan Coast. “The Belt and Road initiative gives our continent the opportunity to make a paradigm shift. Post-colonial Africa has been stuck in a rut,” Uhuru said. The continent, he said, must move from being mere consumers of imports of finished products to exporters of basic commodities and materials. “This will lead to quality jobs and prosperity for millions of our youth. We will all win when our people have access to the technology they need to add value to our continent’s wealth of resources. Value addition is key.”
