China's first large domestically made passenger aircraft is due to take its maiden flight, mounting a major challenge to Boeing and Airbus.The plane is a key symbol of Beijing's soaring ambitions to enter the global aviation market.The jet by state-owned firm Comac has been planned since 2008 but the flight was repeatedly pushed back.The C919 is designed to be a direct competitor to Boeing's 737 and the Airbus A320.It's estimated that the global aviation market will be worth $2tn (&pound;1.55tn) over the next 20 years.The plane is scheduled to take off from Shanghai's Pudong International Airport later on Friday.It still relies on a wide array of imported technology though, it is for instance powered by engines from French-US supplier CFM International.Orders have already been placed for more than 500 of the planes, with commitments from 23 customers, say officials, mainly Chinese airlines. The main customer is China Eastern Airlines.Europe's aviation safety regulator has started the certification process for the C919 - a crucial step for the aircraft to be successful on the international market.China has had ambitions to build its own civil aircraft industry since the 1970s, when leader Mao Zedong's wife, Jiang Qing, personally backed a project.But the Y-10, built in the late 1970s, was impractical due to its heavy weight and only three of the aircraft were ever made.
