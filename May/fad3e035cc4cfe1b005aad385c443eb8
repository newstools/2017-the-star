U.S. lawmakers threatened United Airlines (UAL.N) and other carriers on Tuesday with legislation aimed at improving customer service after a passenger was hauled down the aisle of a flight last month.Top airline executives testified to the House of Representatives transportation committee and promised to address customer service failures at the hearing held to consider ways to address passenger frustrations with problems such as overbooking.The industry breathed a sigh of relief after the four-hour hearing, in which lawmakers did not outline any immediate plans for increased oversight on the largely deregulated sector.In April, video went viral on social media of 69-year-old passenger David Dao being dragged from a United flight at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport after he refused to give up his seat to make room for crew members.United Chief Executive Oscar Munoz repeatedly apologized at the hearing for the removal of Dao, with whom the airline reached a settlement last week for an undisclosed sum. "In that moment for our customers and our company we failed, and so as CEO, at the end of the day, that is on me," Munoz said. He called the removal the result of a series of system failures and "a mistake of epic proportions."Munoz was joined at the hearing by United President Scott Kirby and executives from American Airlines (AAL.O), Southwest Airlines (LUV.N) and Alaska Airlines (ALK.N). American Airlines experienced its own public relations fiasco last month when a passenger video went viral, showing a woman on a plane in tears holding a child in her arms and another at her side after an encounter with a flight attendant over a baby stroller. "Clearly what happened was wrong," said Kerry Philipovitch, the airline's senior vice president of customer experience, at the hearing.
