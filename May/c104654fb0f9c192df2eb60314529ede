Migori Governor Okoth Obado on Monday took his first campaigns to Kuria to woo residents to support his reelection.This came amid tension over who would be his running mate.The Kuria are the native minority tribe in the county, which is largely dominated by the Luo.Obado met elders and opinion leaders from the community&rsquo;s four clans &mdash; the Abairege, Abanyabasi, Abagumbe and Abakira &mdash; in Kehancha Stadium.There has been confusion among the clans, as elders met with the governor to help pick a running mate. No name has been floated.Current Deputy Governor Mwita Mahanga, who is from the minority Abairege, was conspicuously missing.Attempts to get a comment from him were unsuccessful as calls did not go through.Migori director of gender Rebecca Maroa, a close confidant of Obado&rsquo;s wife Hellen, was present, accompanied by her supporters.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have something small for each house. One clan will get the deputy governor post and the rest will get a county executive each. Positions of chief officers will also be shared equally,&rdquo; Obado said.He said the community stands to benefit a lot under his administration and urged it to back his bid to the last man.Obado said he will keep his promise once reelected.Only two executives &mdash; Sheila Ghati from the Abagumbe clan and Thomas Maneno from the Abairege &mdash; were appointed to the current Obado administration.Maneno resigned to run for Kuria East MP.The Abanyabasi and Abakira clans, which are the most populous, were left out. They largely support Obado&rsquo;s rival Ochillo Ayacko.Obado said woman representative Dennitah Ghati, who was defeated in the ODM primaries, will be nominated by the party. Ghati is a Kuria.Obado was reacting to elders who warned they will not support NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga after negotiated democracy failed and Kuria aspirants for woman MP and senator lost in the primaries.At the 2013 election, the Luo community reserved the Senate, woman representative and deputy governor seats for the Kuria community.In return, the Kuria were to vote for Raila as a bloc.Another beneficiary of the pre-election pact was Wilfred Machage, who won the Senate seat on the ODM ticket.He has rejoined his former party, DP, on whose ticket he plans to run for Kuria West MP.In 2013, incumbent Mathias Robi of URP won the seat. He is from the Abagumbe clan.Machage is from the Abakira clan.URP also won the Kuria East seat. Based on the outcome of the last general election, the Luos felt cheated after the Kuria community divided its votes almost equally between Raila and Jubilee&rsquo;s Uhuru Kenyatta.On Saturday, Ayacko will be in Kuria. He will be accompanied by Lucas Mosenda, a likely running mate.Mosenda is from the Abakira clan.
