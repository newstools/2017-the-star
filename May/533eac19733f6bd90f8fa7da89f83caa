Illegal sand harvesting has been called the underlying cause of flooding in Junda, Mombasa county, where hundreds of residents have suffered.Lands Executive Anthony Njaramba on Thursday blamed the illegal sand harvesters for the flooding.Many people in Junda built their houses in abandoned quarries and low-lying areas left after sand was harvested. Houses were submerged by rainwater after a deluge on Monday and Tuesday, leaving hundreds homeless. On Thursday, on his way to distribute food, mattresses and blankets in Junda, Njaramba encountered illegal sand harvesters. He ordered the arrest of six harvesters, who had three lorries. The lorries were towed to the Mombasa Inspectorate headquarters in Tudor.
