The disputes tribunal has dismissed Jack Ranguma's appeal against Anyang' Nyong'o who was declared winner of the Kisumu governor nominations.The appeal was dismissed on Saturday on technicality grounds - the Political Parties Disputes Tribunal said petitioners Hezron Opiyo and John Ongere did not use internal dispute resolution mechanisms. It was said they filed their petition before approaching the ODM National Appeals Tribunal.But the tribunal headed by Kyalo Mbobu recognised that it was Ranguma, who is Kisumu Governor, and aspirant Hezron McObewa who went to the tribunal.Ranguma was represented by senior counsel James Mwamu and Isaiah Munje and Nyong'o by Victor Obondi and Julie Soweto while advocate Anthony Oluoch represented the party led by Raila Odinga. The county chief made the appeal against the decision by the board to issue Senator Nyong'o a nominations certificate.The appeals tribunal had nullified certificates given to the two. The four-member team headed by Willis Otieno then asked the ODM National Executive Committee to decide on the candidate.ODM nominations in Kisumu were marred with confusion after both Ranguma and Nyong&rsquo;o were seperately declared winners and given provisional certificates.Through lawyers James Mwamu and Isaiah Munje, the Governor said he was the legitimate winner but Nyong'o also told the tribunal he was duly elected on April 25.He was declared winner by county returning officer Tom Okong&rsquo;o at Thurdibuoro Secondary School in Nyakach constituency, with 164,110 votes against Ranguma&rsquo;s 91,480.Ranguma was also announced the winner at Aga Khan Hall in Kisumu town by deputy returning officer Richard Kiyondi with 118,934 votes against Nyong&rsquo;o&rsquo;s 32,028.More on this: I did not concede, I was rigged out of Kisumu governor primaries - RangumaAlso read: Loser Ranguma accuses ODM of imposing Nyong&rsquo;o on locals
