The family of former Kitui mayor Martha Mwangangi has criticised the chaos that erupted during her burial last December, leading to the ejection of Governor Julius Malombe.Speaking nearly six months after the December 23 violence, Mwangangi&rsquo;s son, Mutia, blamed the chaos on politicians.He greatly disappointed by the events of that day,&rdquo; Mutia said. He spoke on Monday at their Kyanika village home.Mutia said long after his mother died, politicians still make reference of her death to gain political mileage. &ldquo;We are against politicians campaigning and invoking our late mother&rsquo;s name. Her name should not be used for political reasons,&rdquo; he said. Mwangangi died after she was crushed by a Kitui government fire engine.
