The ongoing heavy rains have turned out to be a blessing for the endangered Lake Naivasha, with water levels rising.Two of the six rivers that had dried up due to the prolonged harsh weather conditions have started to fill again, raising hopes water levels could return to normal.The Water Resources Users Association has said some farmers continue to block the flow of water into the rivers.It urged the Water Resource and Management Authority to intervene.WRUAs chairman Enock Kiminta said, &ldquo;Water levels in River Malewa, which is the main source of water for Lake Naivasha, has risen in the last two weeks and we hope water will flow to the other rivers too.&rdquo;He spoke in Naivasha on Saturday. Kiminta expressed concern about the massive obstruction, terming it a major threat to the lakes&rsquo; future.He accused flower farms and KenGen of using thousands of litres of water per day in geothermal drilling. Kiminta said projects including the industrial park and SGR have destroyed the lake.
