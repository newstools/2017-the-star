The ODM national chairman John Mbadi was yesterday dealt a blow after the Political Parties Disputes Tribunal nullified his nomination for the Suba South parliamentary seat.The tribunal said the decision by the party&rsquo;s Central Committee to give him a direct nomination certificate is null and void. The three-member tribunal, led by chairman Kyalo Mbobu, ordered the party to hold fresh nominations in seven polling centres within 72 hours following a successful petition by Caroli Omondi. They include Godoloo, Mikuyu, Miriya, Koga, Nyakiya, Oma and Kiembe stations.Caroli, a former chief of staff in the defunct office of Prime Minister, moved to the PPDT on Monday after ODM ignored a directive from the tribunal to nullify the results. &ldquo;The contested results of the seven stations ought to have been cancelled, &ldquo; the tribunal said on Friday.
