Wiper Party nominee for the position of Machakos Governor Wavinya Ndeti's campaign got a boost on Friday when 30 Members of the County Assembly endorsed her bid.The MCAs mainly from Wiper Party and Chama cha Uzalendo led by Deputy Speaker Nathaniel Nganga met Wavinya at Maanzoni Lodge in Machakos.They promised to marshal support for her in their respective wards.The MCAs said their wards had been discriminated in terms of development during governor Alfred Mutua's tenure and there was no reason to re-elect him."We have come here to pledge our support to Wavinya Ndeti and her deputy Peter Mathuki. We will go out of our way and do all that is needed to ensure the two are elected Governor and Deputy respectively in the August 8 elections," said Nganga.Read: Wavinya crushes Kiala with 299,312 votes for Machakos governor ticketHe said water scarcity continued to bedevil the county despite governor Mutua's propaganda that he had sorted the problem in the county."We saw him kicking buckets at the Bomas of Kenya early in the year to symbolise an end to the water problems in Machakos County, this is an absolute lie," he said.Ekala kala MCA Isaac Muinde said they will support NASA candidates and ensure all Jubilee 'moles' in the county are defeated in the elections.Ndeti and her running mate Mathuki welcomed the support and assured that their government will accord MCAs a free will to perform their duties."I want to assure that never again will the MCAs be manipulated by the County Government of Machakos. We will work as a team to deliver the much needed development for this County," Wavinya said.Peter Mathuki said that the current administration has been characterized by fights between the Governor and the MCAs and that&rsquo;s why the County has lagged behind in development.Read: ODM leaders to back Wavinya for Machakos top jobAlso read; Governor Mutua dismisses 'fake' Wiper primaries after Wavinya win
