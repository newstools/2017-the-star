Kwale residents have praised the Australian mining company Base Titanium for supporting learners.The company has sponsored training of 20 students, who graduated last week from the first intake of its three-year apprenticeship programme. Speaking during a graduation ceremony on Thursday at the Baobab Beach Resort, Kwale director of education Bridget Wambua said the company will help college leavers to join the job market and be recruited anywhere in the world. &ldquo;I urge other investors to support education,&rdquo; she said. This came in the wake of a 2015 social initiative study by McKinsey that found that 40 per cent of employers reported skills gaps in entry level vacancies. It said technology worsened the problem as it replaced manual jobs, leaving millions of young people unprepared to participate in the 21st-century knowledge economy. The three-year programme targetted recent form-four leavers who have been accepted into the Technical University of Mombasa and the National Industrial Training Authority. They were equipped with real life experience and on-job skills transfer.
