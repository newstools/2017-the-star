A judge has nullified the law requiring that presidential candidates be nominated by individuals who belong to the hopeful&rsquo;s political party.This means that presidential candidates can be nominated by anyone.Section 29 of the Election Act, which was nullified, also imposes requirement that people who nominate independent presidential candidates must not belong to any political party.Also nullified by judge George Odunga is a section of law that requires all presidential aspirants submit their nomination signatures from 24 counties in an electronic format.&ldquo;By providing that all presidential candidates submit their list of 2,000 supporters from at least 24 counties to the commission by excel, the independent electoral and boundaries commission went overboard and purported to unlawfully and unjustifiably restrict or limit rights of such candidates to exercise their political rights under the Constitution,&rdquo; the judge said.Odunga said those requirements are unconstitutional and imposes unjustifiable restrictions on aspirants.His decision arose out of a case filed by Peter Solomon Gichira.Gichira, in his suit had said the requirement that presidential candidates must submit supporters details in a Microsoft Excel format and must not be members of a registered political party was discriminatory.The requirements according to the court documents was announced to prospective candidates on May 17, through social media.&ldquo;The list of nominees was to be handed over between May 18 and 22, but that notice was too short, unreasonable and impractical at this stage,&rdquo; Gichira says.According to him, the new requirement was non-existent when he was issued with the necessary forms and cleared by the Registrar of Political Parties on March 30.His contention is the requirement has consequences of barring him from vying in the General Election.&ldquo;It is only fair that the regulation be declared unlawful,&rdquo; Gichira said.
