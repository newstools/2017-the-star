Former champions Kenya Police tightened their grip on league leadership, thanks to 5-1 win over Kenyatta University in a mid-week clash of the men&rsquo;s Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) Premier League match at the City Park Stadium.Amos Barkibir (16th), captain Brian Saina(47th), Samuel Wokila (50th),Titus Kimutai (59th) and Arvin Kuru(60th) scored for the law enforcers as Lawrence Makhasa pulled one back for the students in the 22nd minute.The 2013 champions have 21 points from seven matches and remain unbeaten. Greensharks are second with 17 points from eight matches while Wazalendo complete the top three positions with 10 points from four matches. The defeat leaves the students in sixth position on the log with seven points from four matches.Police assistant captain Oliver Echenje said it is encouraging that they have maintained unbeaten run and hope to keep it that way going forward in the seasonEchenje said: &ldquo;So far, so good. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we become compalacent. However, the winning streak gives us confidence going forward in the league,&rdquo;He added: &ldquo;We are putting everything into our training sessions and so far the results are reflecting our hardwork and sacrifices. Our objective at the end of it all is to win the title this year.&rdquo;Last year&rsquo;s men&rsquo;s KHU Premier League champions Strathmore University are yet to impress as the league gathers momentum. They are currently in the ninth position with five points, having won one game, drawn two and lost two. The 2015 champions Butali Sugar Warriors, who are placed sixth with six points from two matches, draw their consolation from the fact that they still have many games to play as compared to all the other 14 teams in the top tier. Butali will be out to bag three points when they play Wazalendo at City Park on Sunday.
