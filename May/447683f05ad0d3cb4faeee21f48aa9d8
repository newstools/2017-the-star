Celebrated female gospel singer Mercy Masika made a major comeback with her song Mwema last year after a long musical hiatus. The song propelled her back to success and since then, she has been the most sought-after and loved gospel artiste in Kenya, not just because of her musical prowess but also for her humble personality. Mercy Masika, now a wife and doting mother of two, has done it again with her inspiring music by notching two top nominations in the 2017 Groove Awards. The jolly and excited mellow singer, who has a new song Shule Yako, was named in the Groove Female Artiste 2017 category and her song Huyu Yesu in the Groove Song Of The Year category. She was also nominated for Groove Collabo Of The Year for Huyu Yesu, which she sang with Angel Benard. Other female singers nominated for the Groove Female Artiste include Size 8, Kambua, Alice Kimanzi, Evelyn Wanjiru and Princess Faridah. Other songs nominated for the Groove Song Of The Year include: Bamba Mbaya by Kelele Takatifu, Bazokizo by Collo & Bruz Newton, Kutembea Nawe by Rebecah Dawn, Pale Pale by Size 8 and Thitima Anthem by Kymo & Stigah. The other shocker at the nominations, which were held at Chandaria Centre, was the revelation that Willy Paul and his on-and-off frenemy Bahati were not nominated for any category, which is the second time it has happened.
