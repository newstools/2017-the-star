Nairobi Senate aspirant Bukachi Chapia yesterday suffered a setback after the High Court dismissed a petition he lodged protesting against a move by ODM to take away his certificate.Justice John Mativo (pictured), without hearing arguments from parties, struck out the suit, saying it had been filed in the wrong forum.The judge was of the view Chapia, who claims ODM is planning to snatch away his victory because he has no resources to mount serious campaigns in the city, should have first lodged a complaint before the party and its tribunal before approaching the court.The politician wanted the court to stop the IEBC from gazetting Edwin Sifuna as the Senate candidate.Through lawyer Kibe Mungai, Chapia had stated in court documents the party has been pressuring him to step down for Sifuna.Sifuna was interested in the Kanduyi parliamentary seat, but lost in the nomination in Bungoma county on a Ford Kenya Ticket.Chapia said party leader Raila Odinga and Governor Evans Kidero told him bluntly he doesn&rsquo;t have the money to campaign in a big city.&ldquo;The move is discriminatory because he is being denied the chance to serve Nairobians because he is a man of humble means,&rdquo; he said.He further argued he was given a certificate by ODM because no one opposed his candidature. Chapia said the party also told him Raila and NASA co-principal Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula had agreed the seat be given to Ford Kenya.
