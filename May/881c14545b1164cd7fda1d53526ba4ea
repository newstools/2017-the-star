Suspected Pokot bandits raped two women and stole livestock during fresh attacks in Laikipia on Tuesday and Wednesday. The women aged 17 and 22 were rushed to hospital. One of the women was raped on Wednesday night, after the attackers stormed a security meeting and shot at people. Witnesses said they paralysed the meeting by shooting in the air, dispersing residents and security officers. "It was a dark day as the meeting was invaded by Pokot bandits who sprayed bullets at people including the OCS and the DCIO," a resident told The Star.  "Security officers exchanged fire with the attackers but they were overpowered." Reports indicated several residents were injured as they scampered for safety. The father of the woman attacked on Wednesday said a gang of eight men armed with AK 47 rifles raided his home in Laikipia West at about 2am and drove away cows and goats. “There was a loud bang on the door before the men got in, all of them armed. They ordered us to lie on the floor and raped my daughter in turns as my wife and I watched. They pointed their guns at us," he said. Area chief John Wamai said said all the animals in the village were stolen. “Nobody slept the whole night as the bandits moved from home to home rounding up livestock. They disappeared into a valley in the neighboring Laikipia Nature Conservancy after police officers and NPR’s engaged them." Following the incident, hundreds of residents blocked Nyahururu-Ol Ng’arua road for hours in protests against insecurity, They accused security agencies deployed to the area of doing little to deal with herders who invaded property including private ranches. “It is so unfortunate that bandits have launched raids on us during security operations that include KDF. We have not seen any fruits more than a month after the operation was launched,” said resident Martin Wanjohi. Laikipia West MP Wachira Karani and area MCA Peter Thomi, who went to calm the protesters, urged the government to deal with the bandits mercilessly. “These incidents are becoming too many. We want the government to start treating these bandits like armed bank robbers or any other criminals who steal and kill," said Karani. County commissioner Onesmus Musyoki said security officers have managed to drive out most of the bandits. But several politicians want the government to take full responsibility for security in Laikipia and Baringo as it mandated with protecting citizens and their property. Their call on Tuesday came just a day after Rift Valley regional coordinator Wanyama Musiambo announced there will be no political campaigns in Laikipia and Samburu. Musiambo declared that Rumuruti, Olmoran, Kirimon, Marmanet, Mukogodo East, Segera, Mithiga and Matuiku in Laikipia West and North sub-counties were disturbed and dangerous zones.
