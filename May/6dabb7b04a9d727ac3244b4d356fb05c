Reading self-appointed political analysts both in mainstream and social media, one gets disturbed by the selective amnesia being packaged for the masses to consume. Jubilee regime has perfected the art of spewing lies in the form of well-construed propaganda. I have had to explain to friends and colleagues across the globe that what you hear from Jubilee politicians, including the President, cannot be believed for what it is.This is a regime that has perfected the art of repetitive form of propaganda to advance lies that do not even make sense to a 10-year-old. To be fair to Kenyans and the presidency as an institution, fidelity to the Constitution, sanctity of common sense and decorum hold that every leader, including the Executive arm of government, strives to portray the highest levels of integrity, attributes that only exist in an environment of honesty.Ideally, unlike the opposition, the incumbent regime would be boasting of achievements beyond the normal functions any government worth its salt ought to accomplish. In an environment rife with corruption, deceit, and blackmail, and without a meaningful development agenda, the incumbent regime is indeed struggling to convince Kenyans that it has has made a difference.It is not uncommon to hear Kenyans aspire to be taken to this &lsquo;Kenya&rsquo; Jubilee has developed with its vibrant education sector, perfect healthcare systems, great wealth and efficient transport infrastructure, overflowing with employment opportunities for the youth and digitised to the village level.Whenever I look at our President and his deputy championing their reelection, I am reminded of Genghis Kahn, whose reign in China in 1206-1227 was characterised by en masse slaughter of civilians in the name of governance.The rising government debt is not any different from slaughtering the Kenyan citizens whose future burden of repaying the loans does not bother the regime. This makes a miniature the ruthless Timur aka Tamarlane (1370&ndash;1405) whose wisdom saw him order construction of a magnificent tower made of living men each stacked on another and like bricks cemented together in the name of development.The basic expectations of citizenry of any government include provision of security, reliable and effective healthcare, water and sanitation, education, promotion of welfare and reliable transport system, none of which Jubilee has addressed. The brutality with which the regime has polarised Kenya is unprecedented. The prosperous nation that was promised during the previous electoral campaigns is only in existence in the realm of few beneficiaries of corruption, skewed public appointments, insecurity, ill healthcare system, and mass youth unemployment. Much to the chagrin of the populace, the United Nations Development Programme Report 2016 rightly points to Kenya&rsquo;s poor performance in employment creation at the bottom of other East African countries, including struggling Burundi. With the evident commitment to milk the country dry, Jubilee has re-energised efforts to secure a second term amidst superfluous drama around the presidency being demystified.The promised agenda revolved around putting food on every Kenyan&rsquo;s table, ensuring access to quality education, wealth creation for all and not a few selected Kenyans, quality and affordable healthcare, women empowerment, and security of and for Kenyans. The mere fact that Jubilee's much-talked about development has to be retrieved from specific websites is in itself suspect.It is only fair that the government&rsquo;s performance is measured against its own manifesto and promises rather than projects that were initiated by previous regimes and would somehow be completed irrespective of the regime in power.Feigning ignorance of the laws of the land, the President recently was at pains to convince the Kisii community that he deserves a second term to the extent that the appointment of the current Chief Justice, who happens to be from the community, became an &lsquo;implemented manifesto&rsquo;. This demonstrates the extent of their desperation.In social circles, it is not uncommon to hear Kenyans talk about this regime's dishonesty, to the extent that even a few honest efforts by the government to improve people&rsquo;s livelihoods are perceived as sinister and untruthful. This is a regime whose survival can only be attributed to the ethnicised citizenry of this country and nothing else. When none other than a head of state deconstructs the truth to save face amidst impending defeat, our collective conscience ought to be awakened.Kenyans have seen such a fa&ccedil;ade of choreographed propaganda advanced by the people in high offices that many wonder if they really live in the same country as the Jubilee leadership. One never falls short of illustrations of the extent to which dishonesty as a philosophy drives the Jubilee agenda.Kenyans are well aware of the outcomes of the last two general elections so much so that when NASA leaders are branded losers, for instance, then one wonders to what extent respect of a court outcome is considered concession of defeat. Over the past four years, Jubilee has consistently advanced the theory that Raila Odinga is a perennial loser incapable of capturing power, which is so fallacious an argument from all angles for those who care to jog their memories of Kenyan politics and electoral processes. This is a discussion for another day.It is simplistic to argue that the NASA leadership, and anyone else keen to run for President and public office, ought to account for their previous contributions to the development of this country at the level of a head of state and government.In fact, if we subjected the incumbent regime to the very burden, then I&rsquo;m not sure they would even be considered fit to serve and lead this country. None other than Jomo Kenyatta Daniel Moi, Mwai Kibaki and now Uhuru Kenyatta have been Presidents of Kenya; it is then expected that the rest of Kenyans can be potential leaders should they demonstrate a passion and ability to serve and convince Kenyans to vote for them.It is only the previous presidents that have squarely been responsible for the social, economic and political failures and the current state of the nation as they had all the power to make a difference had they so wished.When a government behaves like the opposition and consolidates its entire communications machinery to advance propaganda rather than present sound policy reform and development agenda for reelection, one wonders if such a government ascended to power for the right reasons in the first place.It is time Kenyans engaged the regime beyond the bravado we are subjected to weekly, with continual draining of taxpayer money; the overriding theme being that NASA will be defeated. NASA has never been a problem to Kenyans as it has never been in power.It is difficult to understand why Kenyans would be interested to vote for UhuRuto. It is indeed bad manners to treat Kenyans to such mediocrity and inadequacy of ideas.The basic question every Kenyan needs to ask themselves before even thinking of voting for Jubilee is, &lsquo;what will this self-seeking group do for Kenyans after August 2017 that will be different from the NYS saga that remains unresolved and the Eurobond scam, among many others that we have yet to discover?&rsquo;.Kenya needs principle-centred leadership with unrelenting commitment to the Kenyan dream, rather than personal greed. A leader who like Benito Musolini would dare ask Kenyans to kill him or her if he retreated on achieving this very dream.This election is indeed for NASA to lose and not otherwise, as we are persuaded to believe. NASA is not the best option, but is obviously much better than the mediocrity and incompetence we have witnessed over the past four years!To objectively appeal to Kenyans, NASA has to be the opposite of Jubilee, invest in proper communications to all Kenyans, irrespective of ethnic and political affiliations and engage Kenyans&rsquo; hearts on issues that really matter. It can be argued that Kenya is worse than President Kibaki left it, as regards the management of the economy, health sector, sports sector, the land question, and just everything else.It takes a struggle to put a finger on a single Jubilee-initiated and completed project. Any manifesto presented to the electorate is as good as a performance contract to be reviewed at the end of five years. Inadequate performance cannot be attributed to time limitations.NASA has to consistently feed Kenyans with the truth whilst advancing a well thought-out development and reform agenda rather than being hoodwinked to respond to half-backed lame propaganda.Should NASA get these basic things right, Jubilee propaganda will be rendered repugnant hence, a very interesting election come August. Kenyans will only be persuaded by a group of corrupt-free and focussed leaders devoid of the grandiosity we have been treated to for four years. It disheartens to see NASA naively fall into Jubilee&rsquo;s trap courtesy of propaganda. NASA has to actualise the aspirations of Kenyans in its manifesto while building a foundation for a society devoid of favouritism, nepotism, exclusion and intimidation of the citizenry.As things stand, what NASA refers to as &lsquo;a seven pillar manifesto' may not be very appealing to all Kenyans unless it has a very elaborate framework oscillating around graft elimination that is bold enough to deal with all graft, including those linked to some of the NASA principals. Perhaps Botswana and Rwanda&rsquo;s approaches to recovery of stolen assets could be explored as a starting point to deal with past graft.A campaign premised on the need to get Jubilee out of power is ideologically lame and holds no water. NASA ought to start articulating alternative solutions to the problems created by Jubilee, including a firm undertaking to decisively deal with corruption.When an incumbent regime gets overly agitated about electoral reforms and gets very personal with opposing forces, then the end is nigh. The country is yearning for leadership, and seems radar-less and navigating in erratic autopilot.Independent development consultant
