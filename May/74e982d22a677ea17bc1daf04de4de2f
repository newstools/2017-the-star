Party primaries were for the most part not free and fair, the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights, which deployed monitors, has said.Its report concludes the primaries were characterised by bribery, violence, missing names of candidates, harassment and duress, intimidation and violence against the marginalised and vulnerable and manipulation of the voter register.Titled &lsquo;The Fallacious Vote&rsquo;, the report said most parties did not prepare adequately for the primaries.Cases of missing names from the party register were the highest concern, with incidents in 115 centres out of the 224 documented.&ldquo;This is attributed to the fact that none of the political parties in the stations monitored had its own authentic party register. KNCHR established most of the political parties resorted to the use of the 2013 IEBC register,&rdquo; the report states.Bungoma county led in voter bribery claims with 25 per cent, followed closely by Nairobi, with 17 per cent, Kirinyaga and Garissa with 9 per cent, respectively.&ldquo;At least 12 cases of open bribery by aspirants was registered and evidence captured by the KNCHR monitoring team,&rdquo; the report reads.Late opening and early or late closing of polling stations was reported in 79 of the 224 centres monitored.The National Police Service provided security of at least two officers in the polling stations.However, in 79 centres, the report notes officers were overwhelmed by the large number of voters.Seventeen incidents of violence were reported in the 33 counties monitored, which resulted in at least two deaths.Ten people were seriously injured and admitted. Twelve cases of intimidation and harassment were reported, including one case of a woman aspirant being banished from her home for participating in the primaries.The report was conducted by KNHRC monitors in 224 centres in 33 counties It mapped potential hotspots based on security trends.
