The mother of the late Olympic marathoner Samuel Wanjiru claims senior police officers in Nyahururu, his lawyer and wife Triza Njeri were involved in her son&rsquo;s death.Giving her moving testimony before presiding magistrate Francis Andayi, Hannah Wanjiru said her son&rsquo;s killers were after his multimillion-shilling estate, which has dwindled to just a few properties. &ldquo;They are subdividing and selling the property. They have sold Wanjiru&rsquo;s house, a tractor, a Range Rover worth Sh12 million and a Subaru,&rdquo; she said. Hannah wants the inquest into her son&rsquo;s death to scrutinise CCTV footage that captured six men and a woman being ushered into his Nyahururu home a few minutes before he was found dead.On Friday, she told the inquest former Nyahururu police boss Jasper Ombati, his juniors, lawyer Wahome Ndegwa and Njeri know what happened to her son. &ldquo;Let me just tell this court openly, I beg, Kamau&rsquo;s guard James Maigwa told me the six people he let in were police officers,&rdquo; Hannah said. Wanjiru died on May 15, 2011, at the age of 24.
