Jubilee leaders in Mombasa met on Thursday to strategise on securing majority votes in the August 8 polls. Top on the agenda was how to
counter NASA "propaganda" in the county led by Hassan Joho with "facts". They also discussed how votes will be
guarded during the election, after claims that President Uhuru
Kenyatta was rigged in 2013. At the meeting held at Methodist
Church, Coast Development Authority director Ibrahim Khamisi said each polling
station will be manned by five Jubilee lieutenants, beside agents. He is a member of Uhuru's campaign team. "Each will be a registered
voter and a Jubilee supporter. They must be voters at that particular polling
station. This will be the time the rubber will meet the road,” he said. NASA intends to apply the same
strategy by placing 450,000 agents across the country. Beside agents, university student volunteers will be deployed to polling stations
countrywide. They will be equipped with
satellite phones to relay live the presidential results declared by presiding
officers. The volunteers will be embedded
with the presidential candidates’ agents and pockets of election observers in
all polling stations. "This is the only
opportunity for us to change the current leadership. If we don't do that, who will?"
Jubilee Mombasa chair Matano Chengo said. The party had been termed as "going
underground" and not campaigning when the presidency leaves town. Khamisi said campaigns should
have been underway by now because the course is tough. "Better late than never. We
are here now. Let's plan ahead before the official campaign date," he
stated. Jubilee is angling to have
Suleiman Shahbal and Anania Mwaboza oust Joho. Mombasa is strategic for Jubilee
economically. This explains the quest to have
their own rule no matter what. The situation has been compounded
by plans to set up a dry port in Naivasha, which is being opposed by Joho. Read: Joho team trashes Jubilee in Coast after UhuRuto's massive campaigns Also read: Jubilee reaps big as Coast leaders leave opposition Naivasha will have a dry port
where some of the activities being carried out at Kenya Ports Authority will be
transferred to. "We must have a clear route
to follow.  Our objective must be well defined and crafted. It won't be guess
work," Khamisi said. He said Jubilee officials in the
county should not wait for Shahbal or Mwaboza to join their campaigns. "We are the owners of the
party. They are just candidates. We have bigger stake so we must take our roles
seriously. They can't do it for us," Khamisi said. Matano said the Raila Odinga dynasty
will end in 2017. He said coast has been out in the
cold for long and cannot afford to be left out again.
