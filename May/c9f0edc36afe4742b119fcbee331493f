We have done the best we can to resolve land issues, including revoking ownership of lands that had been irregularly acquired. We have also issued title deeds to residents who previously could only dream of owning them,&rdquo; he said.Plans are underway to tarmac the Lamu-Witu road, the President added.Jubilee is an administration of actions and not propaganda, he said.Uhuru urged the opposition coalition NASA co-principals to state what they did for Kenyans when they were in government.&ldquo;All the opposition bigwigs have been in government before, but they can&rsquo;t seem to point out even a single thing they did to improve the lives of Kenyans,&rdquo; he said.He said his administration has been keen on working with leaders from all religious backgrounds because it believes in unity and equality.&ldquo;Ours is a problem-solving administration and that&rsquo;s why we subsidised the maize flour to Sh90 [for a 2kg packet] so that all Kenyans can afford and access it,&rdquo; Uhuru said.Unga prices had risen to between Sh150-Sh180 for a 2kg packet before the government subsidy.Uhuru said the government plans to set aside Sh5 billion in the next financial year to cater for free secondary school education.Out of the Sh5 billion, Sh20 million will be given to Lamu girls for the construction of new dormitories.&ldquo;We want to ensure free education right from standard one to form four as from next year. Let us unite to change lives in Lamu and Kenya as a whole by giving Jubilee another chance to lead this country,&rdquo; Uhuru said.Ruto asked Lamu to stop &ldquo;playing cards with your vote&rdquo; and reelect Jubilee leaders because the administration has been beneficial to them.&ldquo;The Witu-Lamu road, for instance, has not been here for more than 40 years but nothing happened. We have only been in office for four years and we are having it constructed,&rdquo; he said.Ruto added that the government has restored security in the county.
