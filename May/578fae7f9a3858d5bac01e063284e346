The Senate has insisted that the counties must be allocated Sh29 billion more than the amount proposed by the National Assembly, signalling a looming standoff between the two Houses.Senate majority leader Kithure Kindiki yesterday warned that they will not allow another version of the Division of Revenue Bill, 2017 that reduces counties&rsquo; funds.National Assembly Budget and Appropriations Committee chairman Mutava Musyimi last week said the panel will republish the bill.The Bill guides the sharing of revenue between the national government and the devolved units.The previous version collapsed after a mediation committee formed by the bicameral house to unlock a dispute over the sharing formula failed to strike a deal.The law provides that if there is no agreement within 30 days after the setting up of the mediation committee, then the bill collapses.Senate won&rsquo;t budgeThe Senate proposed that allocation to the counties be increased from Sh323 billion approved by the National Assembly to Sh352 billion, resulting in the Sh29 billion at the centre of the standoff.Although Kindiki supported the budget committee&rsquo;s decision to republish the bill, he said the Senate will not budge on its push to ensure the counties are allocated adequate resources.&ldquo;Last time, our position was very clear on what amount we thought was adequate and equitable for sharing between the two levels of government. We can&rsquo;t force the assembly to agree to a certain figure,&rdquo; the Tharaka Nithi senator said.&ldquo;But, of course, when the Bill comes to us, on the counties getting an allocation that can help them to perform their functions within the law, that is the function of the Senate.&rdquo;He said the principle is that the counties must be allocated adequate resources to perform their functions.&ldquo;That is what informed our position last time and that principle has not changed,&rdquo; Kindiki said.&ldquo;It is not likely to change and it will not change.&rdquo;The counties are staring at a possible financial crisis from July 1 should Parliament fail to pass the Bill before the bicameral House adjourns on June 15 for the August 8 general election.Both Houses must pass the Division of Revenue Bill, before the President can assent to it.The National Assembly has already passed the Appropriations Bill.The Bill focuses on expenditure at the national level.It came before the Division of Revenue Bill.The Appropriations Bill outlines how the national government shares revenue among ministries, departments and other state agencies.
