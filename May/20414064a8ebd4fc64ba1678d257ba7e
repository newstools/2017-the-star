Lawyers representing the late Mark Too's family have demanded Sh12.5 million from Simon Lilan over the case he filed to stop his burial in January.They want Lilan to pay the money to cover the costs of the case he filed against the family and several other prominent personalities, including Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi."We have already filed our bill of costs and the case was to come up for hearing but the file could not be traced," Steve Biko, one of the lawyers, told journalists on Tuesday."Lilan lost the case and he knows there is the party to party bill of costs and that is what we are taxing," Biko added.The matter was to come up before High Court deputy registrar Harrison Barasa on Tuesday, but it will now be mentioned on June 14 to establish if the file has been traced.Lilan is yet to file his response on the matter but he said he will do so soon.In January, he disputed Too's burial claiming he had been assassinated for his vast wealth or political reasons. He also said there were plans to kill his first wife, Mary.Lilan had also claimed his life was in danger and that he had received threats from unidentified people telling him to stop pushing for independent investigations.Read: Court lifts order blocking Mark Too burial, service underway in EldoretThe lawyer was reported missing on the day Too was buried, after the court order he had obtained against the ceremony was lifted.It later emerged Lilan was hiding in a foreign embassy after police allegedly refused to protect him.
