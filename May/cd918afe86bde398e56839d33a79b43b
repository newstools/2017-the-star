Parliament is to vote this week on nine members of the East African Legislative Assembly, which begins sittings from next week.The process has been marred by controversy over nomination of Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka&rsquo;s son Kennedy and Cord&rsquo;s short list of only four names.Raila&rsquo;s brother, nominated MP Oburu Oginga, was on the Cord list but dropped out due to nepotism controversy.More names are traditionally submitted and Cord has been urged to submit more, but has refused.The joint select committee processing the nominations has recommended to the House that Cord increase its number of nominees.The House is expected to vote before Friday on the combined 19 names, or so.Up to last evening, some nominees were lobbying MPs across the political divide to support them.According to an earlier schedule, MPs were to vote last week, but a deadlock between the Jubilee and Cord over nominees caused the delay. A week ago, JP through National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale, wrote to the joint committee opposing the four Cord nominees. JP says the list is short to limit choices. &ldquo;I lodge my party&rsquo;s two objections to nomination ... [to] EALA... In forwarding four names, the coalition mischievously seeks to deny the House the freedom of choice to reject any or all of the four candidates,&rdquo; Duale said.&ldquo;This is clearly a mischievous attempt to tie the freedom of choice at the voting stage, more so where the records indicate that at the close of applications, Cord had 41 applicants &mdash; 24 in the National Assembly and 17 in the Senate.&rdquo;The coalition, led by Raila Odinga, has nominated, for the second time, Zein Abubakar and Judith Pareno.
