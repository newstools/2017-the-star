Presidential aspirant Abduba Dida is displeased that "naked women" walk around IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati's office.Dida also took a swipe at Chebukati on Tuesday for not paying enough attention to the activities in his office."When I presented my signatures to IEBC last night, there were women who were naked. My daughter asked me 'daddy, how come there are so many naked women'?," he said at Nairobi Safari Club during IEBC's meeting with presidential aspirants.He asked the chairman to step up and "check what is happening around your office". Dida further told Chebukati not to undermine the number of independent candidates who are presidential aspirants. He noted Kenyans are tired of the leadership that has compelled politicians to vie without affiliation to any political parties."[The fact that there are 4,000 independent candidates] is a good indication we are not happy with the current leadership. If your father has failed you, it is your responsibility to say, "Dad, go and rest," he said."There are many aspirants who have gone independent but never undermine a potential leader. God is in charge. If everybody hates you...hate won't decrease anything...if the citizens are wajanja, wajanja (crafty), God will bring a leader who is mjanja raised to power 6."Read: List of 18 Kenyans in race to State HouseDescribing NASA's threat to boycott elections as monkey business, Dida asked Chebukati to take great care ahead of the general election on August 8.The National Super Alliance threatened to boycott the poll if the electoral commission amends laws stopping the declaration of presidential results at the polling station.The coordinating committee led by James Orengo told the electoral agency to withdraw the petition challenging the High court decision on tallying.The court ruled on April 7 that presidential results declared at the polling station and constituency during the August 8 polls will be final."I wish you well, Mr chairman, with the Kalonzo and Raila monkey business...Mungu akusaidie (May God help you)," he added.More on this: NASA threatens to skip polls over IEBC appeal on tallying lawIn February, Dida said he will unseat Uhuru in the August 8 polls.
