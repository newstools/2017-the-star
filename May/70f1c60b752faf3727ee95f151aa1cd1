Did you know Hell's Gate was the inspiration for the Lion King movie?Some scenes from the Tomb Raider 2 film were shot there.If you are looking for a day trip, this is an ideal location. You can drive through the park as you watch wildlife, ride a bicycle or walk. The entry fees is Sh300, renting a bicycle is Sh500, and a car is charged separately.If you like rock climbing, you can stop at Fischer's Tower, a few metres from the entrance. If you are a beginner, you are advised not to aim for the cliff. It takes about 15 minutes to climb for beginners and that will cost you Sh500. There is a guide who will help you throughout, so don&rsquo;t worry.After your climb, you can do the gorge walk, which can take anywhere between one and three hours, depending on whether you want to go the entire path. One of the spots to look out for is the hot springs, which people claim will give you flawless skin. You can end your journey by buying jewellery from Maasai women selling an assortment of pieces.Not far from the park is the Ol Karia Geothermal Spa. You can take a swim inside the naturally heated pool. Though I must warn, the path to the swimming pool itself does not have the most pleasant smell. Think rotten eggs. Brine is brought in by pipes and allowed to cool before being released into the pool. The water is rich in sulphur, giving it a cloudy look. It is apparently good for the skin. I don&rsquo;t know about that, though, as mine felt pretty dry after taking a dip.The spa is a product of geothermal power projects by KenGen. Entry fees is Sh400.Location: Naivasha, 95km from NairobiContacts: 0726610508/9; [email&#160;protected] Star Rating: 4/5
