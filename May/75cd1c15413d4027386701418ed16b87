A leading health organisation is urging China to increase its pledge to the Global Fund from $18 million (Sh1.8 billion) to $1 billion to combat the rising threat posed by the spread of HIV-Aids, TB and malaria worldwide.Aids Healthcare Foundation&ndash;Kenya said if the funding for these three health pandemics is not increased, it could result in the deaths of 21 million people and another 28 million new infections.AHF-Kenya programme development manager Faith Ndung&rsquo;u spoke in Ruiru on Saturday. She said the current pledge by China of $18 million is too low for a country whose economy is position two in the world. In a statement issued ahead of the G7 meeting in Sicily, Italy, Ndung&rsquo;u appealed to China to play a leading role in combating the diseases. &ldquo;China is an important leader in international relations, yet it has only contributed $18 million to the fund, compared to Japan&rsquo;s $800 million,&rsquo;&rsquo; Ndung&rsquo;u said.
