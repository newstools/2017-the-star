NGO Coordination Board chief executive officer Fazul Mahamed, alias Mahamed Yusuf, was hired despite having no qualification, the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission has said.In details contained in a March 31 Kenya Gazette notice, the EACC concluded an inquiry into corruption allegations that Fazul had used forged certificates to secure employment as the boss of the board.This not the first time Fazul&rsquo;s degree has been dismissed. In 2015, Egerton University said Mahamed Yusuf, as he was known in college, was discontinued on academic grounds in his third year by its senate on August 26, 2010.His CV shows he graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry in 2009. The university said Fazul was admitted in 2007 to pursue a Bachelor of Science in Agriculture, but changed the course before he was dismissed.In November last year, a report by the Commission on Administrative Justice recommended Fazul&rsquo;s immediate dismissal and ban from holding public office, as he was hired without relevant academic documents.The report further recommended that Fazul refunds Sh8.5 million he earned as cumulative salary because he had shamed the government.&ldquo;Investigations revealed that by the time the CEO was being appointed, he did not have a degree certificate, which was a basic requirement for the position,&rdquo; the EACC said in the gazette notice that is seen to end contestation over Fazul&rsquo;s academic credentials and paves the way for his removal.During the probe, the EACC said it sought to obtain the degree certificate Fazul presented, but could not trace it.&ldquo;It was suspected that the same may have been removed from his personal file and concealed. In the absence of the said forged certificate, a prosecution against him could not be sustained,&rdquo; the EACC explained.However, Fazul dismissed the claims as malice by his critics unhappy with his cleanup of NGOs.
