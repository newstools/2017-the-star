Many analysts expected runaway corruption to become a key issue at the 12th General Election on August 8. But another issue, and one intimately related to graft and incompetence, is fast coming to the fore &ndash; the matter of rising food prices, especially of the national staple unga.There are many more things that divide Kenyans than unite them, but there comes a time when we should not be divided by small things.The spiraling price of maize flour, swiftly labelled &ldquo;unganomics&rdquo; by the chattering classes, is a nightmare theme for the ruling Jubilee Party. It could not have happened at a worse time, less than 90 days to the election. For opposition NASA it would appear to be god-sent. But the point about rising food prices is not merely a matter of adversarial politicking. The &ldquo;mtu wetu&rdquo; factor in Kenyan politics complicates everything. Those who have messed up the strategic maize reserves should be prosecuted for everything from corruption to incompetence, regardless of which side of the political divide they come from.
