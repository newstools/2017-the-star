Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo&rsquo;s failure to capture the ODM ticket to defend his seat is of his own making, nominated MP Oburu Oginga has said.Midiwo lost to Elisha Odhiambo, his perennial nemesis, who got 13,400 votes, against his 8,900 votes.&ldquo;Really, it is his own mistake because he wants to be a kingmaker all over Nyanza, because he was hopping around in a chopper trying to insult candidates,&rdquo; Oburu said on Monday in Mombasa.He said Midiwo, his cousin, concentrated more on campaigning against him in Bondo constituency than campaigning for himself in his own Gem constituency.&ldquo;So, his own people saw that this man is not interested in us. He is just interested in other things other than his own constituency,&rdquo; Oburu said.&ldquo;He lost fairly to Elisha Odhiambo. Now he wants to cry, he wants to blame whoever he wants to blame. But he has himself to blame.&rdquo; The Gem MP had accused Oburu of collecting money from governors in Nyanza to interfere in the ODM primaries.Oburu has denied the claims.&ldquo;It is a very serious allegation, which I&rsquo;m not taking kindly,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;He is my brother and he does not restrain himself from making reckless statements about me.&rdquo;Oburu said he never set foot in Gem constituency until the primaries were over and never associated with any of Midiwo&rsquo;s opponents, so there is no way he could have interfered with the primaries.&ldquo;Because I knew if he was defeated he was going to blame me. I had sensed it before,&rdquo; he said.The nominated MP himself lost in the ODM primaries for Bondo MP to incumbent Gideon Ochanda.
