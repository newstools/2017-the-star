In Israel, when an area receives at least 300 millimetres of rainfall, it is no longer considered a dry area qualified for help. Some of the regions receive as little as 30 millimeters of rainfall and are food self-sufficient. To put this in Kenya’s context, Turkana receives 300 millimetres of rainfall a year. Arid Turkana would, in Israel, be considered able to produce its own food. Yesterday, analysts announced they see average inflation getting worse due to a spike in food prices. Food costs are going up because of the drought, which has suppressed production. Kenya remains dependent on rain-fed agriculture and thus cannot achieve food self-sufficiency. We are adopting agricultural technology at a snail’s pace that will not catapult us from being a net importer of food. Endless trips by MCAs to Israel and other technology driven agricultural producers have not resulted in sufficient knowledge transfer and implementation. What Kenya needs is for the private sector and young, smart farmers to lead an agricultural revolution.
