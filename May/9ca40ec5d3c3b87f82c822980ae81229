Murang&rsquo;a Governor Mwangi Wairia has taken a swipe at Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau for disputing the results of the Jubilee Party nominations.Wairia said it was hypocritical of Jamleck to head to court only weeks after conceding defeat and claiming he would not file a complaint with the party&rsquo;s disputes tribunal.He said Jamleck&rsquo;s allegations that he was rigged out are &ldquo;baseless&rdquo; and meant to cause discontent among residents.&ldquo;It was especially unfortunate for the MP to claim that Deputy President William Ruto interfered with the nominations in my favour,&rdquo; Wairia said at Kambirwa shopping centre in Murang&rsquo;a on Monday.He said Murang&rsquo;a residents came out in large numbers to vote for leaders of their choice and saying the exercise was flawed is tantamount to insulting them.Wairia accused Jamleck of attempting to drive a wedge between Ruto and other party members and causing unrest by implicating him in his woes.Jamleck last week filed a case with the Political Parties Tribunal contesting the governor nominations results.The tribunal ruled the nominations were not free and fair and ordered a repeat exercise.Kamau said the ruling had vindicated him and proven the governor rigged.Wairia, however, filed an appeal at the High Court in Nairobi seeking to have the tribunal&rsquo;s ruling overturned.He managed to have the repeat halted temporarily until the appeal is heard. Wairia said Jamleck was &ldquo;just embarrassed by the fact he was defeated by close to 100,000 votes&rdquo;.&ldquo;What was the intention of going court to have the exercise repeated then claim he would not participate in it because he would be rigged out again?&rdquo; Wairia wondered.
