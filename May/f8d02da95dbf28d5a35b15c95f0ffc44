Lamu woman rep Shakila Abdalla and civil society organisation members have urged Unesco to intervene to stop the establishment of a Sh200 billion coal-fired power plant in the county.In 2001, Unesco listed Lamu Old Town as a World Heritage Site in recognition of its unique cultural value.Speaking in Lamu yesterday, Abdalla and the activists said the Amu Power project will hurt the ecosystem, irreversibly change the community&rsquo;s way of life and ruin their irreplaceable heritage.&ldquo;The project will do a lot of damage, not just to our health and environment but also to the culture and heritage of this place. If this happens, Lamu will be banished from being a world heritage site,&rdquo; Abdalla said.
