Why has no action been taken and no one punished since goons and county assembly workers invaded assembly premises and injured workers on April 7?That&rsquo;s what Nairobi MCAs want to know.They have summoned IG Joseph Boinnet and Director of Public Prosecutions Keriako Tobiko over inaction following &ldquo;a violent invasion&rdquo; of the county assembly premises by the executive.Speaker Alex Magelo said the two officers, charged with the administration of justice, have never acted on the April 7 incident in which the county executive workers and &ldquo;unknown&rdquo; goons violently attacked and injured assembly staff.Stormed offices, evicted workersThe county inspectorate officers and the Kenya County Government Workers Union officials had stormed the fourth floor of the Northern Wing of City Hall.They said they reclaimed offices that had been taken over by the assembly.There was a physical altercation and police used teargas to stop the fighting. Two Serjeant-at-Arms and one MCA were injured.&ldquo;The speaker instructed the clerk to immediately write to the DPP, copy the IGP, requesting them to take appropriate action on offending parties.&ldquo;But since then, the DPP is yet to respond to the request or report on the status of the investigations. The request has now been pending before the DPP for more than 30 days, contrary to the law,&rdquo; Magelo said.The two arms of the county government have been at loggerheads since 2015 over the ownership of offices.Magelo said the assembly had in September 2015 gazetted the entire wing, from the basement to the fifth floor, as assembly precincts. He accused the executive of violating the law in reclaiming them.Working from corridorsIn March, county secretary Robert Ayisi said more than 47 workers from the Evaluation department were working from the corridors, while more than 200,000 property records were inaccessible following office closure.&ldquo;The chief valuer is now operating in a small corner at the City Hall Annex where the Survey department set him up, while his team is operating in the corridors,&rdquo; he said.Tobiko and Boinnet have been summoned to appear before the county assembly&rsquo;s Powers and Privileges Committee on Tuesday.The committee also summoned Head of Inspectorate Department Francis Munyambu, KCGWU Nairobi branch secretary Benson Oliang&rsquo;a and Inspectorate officers Albert Koech, Caleb Otieno and Eva Wairuko to appear before it on the same day.Section 18 of the County Assemblies Powers and Privileges Act gives the assembly or its committees the powers to invite or summon any person to appear before it to provide information.&ldquo;We hope they will honour the summons because we are doing it legally. But if they fail, then we will petition Parliament to take action,&rdquo; minority leader Abdi Guyo said.
