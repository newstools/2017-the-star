Investment promotion agency, the Kenya Investment Authority, says one-stop shop for investors will be opened by end of next month. The centre, which has been on the cards since 2014, is part of the plan to grow foreign direct investments from less than two per cent of the country&rsquo;s gross domestic product to the targeted 10 per cent under the long-term development blueprint, the Vision 2030.KenInvest managing director Moses Ikiara said about Sh140 million has been spent on setting up the new ultra-modern centre at the 33-storey UAP Old Mutual Tower &ndash; the country&rsquo;s tallest building. That included the cost of training officers from key state departments and agencies to help hasten the process of setting up business by foreign investors.The authority said it will also be moving out of the current office space at Kenya Railways Building to the new centre, which occupies two floors at the UAP Old Mutual Tower.&ldquo;The contractor was supposed to be done by 20th of this month, but it looks like there will be a delay of a couple of weeks. So for sure probably by somewhere in mid June,&rdquo; Ikiara said.The agency has brought on board officers from Kenya Power for electricity connection, department of immigration for work permits and registrar of companies for business registrationOthers include Kenya Revenue Authority, National Environmental Management Authority for environmental impact assessment, Kenya Bureau of Standards for quality certification and Export processing Zones for incentives on exports.&ldquo;All the agencies have nominated their officers and we have already started training,&rdquo; Ikiara said.He said the nominated officers are currently undergoing training at the International Development Ireland, an Irish consultancy firm specialising in practical implementation of projects which underpin institutional and corporate development.The firm, sponsored by the Irish embassy, will help KenInvest strengthen its strategy in investment and export promotion, economic zones, innovation, among other target areas.&ldquo;They are actually the ones paying for this to support us. We will continue to work with the Irish embassy to ensure everything is running smoothly,&rdquo; Ikiara said. &ldquo;We really want to give investors something seamless.&rdquo;Ikiara said that investment inquiries have cointinued to grow, with FDIs up by about 98 per cent year-on-year.
