Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho should be included in the NASA Pentagon, a Garissa JP nominee has said.This comes as the NASA lineup unveiled last week continues to draw debate.ODM leader Raila Odinga was named the presidential flagbearer and Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka his running-mate.ANC boss Musalia Mudavadi will be Premier Cabinet Secretary in charge of government coordination. Ford Kenya&rsquo;s Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula and CCM&rsquo;s Isaac Rutto will be Deputy Premier CSs.Joho&rsquo;s political clout has grown in recent years. This is mainly attributed to his bold approach in taking President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto head-on on issues touching on the Coast region. Former Garissa mayor Mohamed Gabow yesterday faulted the NASA lineup and questioned whether the alliance cares about Muslims.The JP nominee for Iftin ward said the outfit should have Joho, a Muslim, on board as part of its summit to show it is committed to forming a government that will protect all Kenyans. &ldquo;By leaving out Joho from the main NASA structure, it means the coalition treats Muslims as a minority group with no value to it,&rdquo; Gabow said.&ldquo;Apart from Kalonzo, all the others in the NASA top brass come from the Western region. The NASA structure lacks the face of Kenya and every right-thinking Kenyan should reject it.&rdquo;He said Joho has fought for and stood by Muslims and Coast residents and leaving him out of the Pentagon is &ldquo;unfair and unacceptable&rdquo;.Garissa Supkem secretary Abdullahi Salat said the fact that there is no Muslim in the NASA lineup clearly shows the coalition has no Muslims&rsquo; interests at heart.&ldquo;They have shot themselves in the foot. They will have themselves to blame if we don&rsquo;t vote for them,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Many of us expected that they would at least include Joho in the lineup to give it a national outlook.&rdquo;Meanwhile, Gabow said the will of residents prevailed during the Jubilee primaries, &ldquo;despite pressure from party stalwarts to have my rival win&rdquo;.He said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in the public domain that some party big guns wanted my opponent to win. But it&rsquo;s the will and the right of the people that led to my victory.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to dwell on the past. I want to unite the people of Garissa town and ensure Jubilee carries the day at the August 8 polls.&rdquo;
