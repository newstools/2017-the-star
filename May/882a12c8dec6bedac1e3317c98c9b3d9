A new study shows it costs more than Sh1 million to keep one rhino safe in Kenya.According to an annual report released by the Ol Pejeta Conservancy, the security and surveillance costs attached to rhino conservation remains high with $10,000 (Sh 1,032,862 ) being allocated to one rhino per year. Ol Pejeta hosts more than 140 rhinos. This means the conservancy spends Sh147,699,266 annually on 143 rhinos. Ol Pejeta hosts East Africa&rsquo;s largest population of highly endangered black rhinos &ndash; 16 per cent of Kenya&rsquo;s population.It also accommodates 26 southern white rhinos and the world&rsquo;s last three northern white rhinos. It costs US$15,000 a year (Sh1,549,761 ) to feed and maintain each of the three in a year, about Sh 4.6 million in total. As set out in its 2020 management plan, the conservancy&rsquo;s goal is to reach a population of 130 black rhinos in the next four years. Ol Pejeta&rsquo;s annual independent rhino population audit confirmed it had 114 black rhinos by the end of 2016, with and 14 black rhino have been born this year. The audit also confirmed a white rhino population of 26. Seven rhinos were lost to poaching, disease and old age in 2016. Despite the loss of three rhinos to poachers, Ol Pejeta continues to have an excellent track record for rhino protection, maintaining high standards from a monitoring and security perspective.CEO Richard Vigne says the rhino numbers continue to increase. He said the costs of their protection will be met by enhancing commercial and donor revenue streams.The report, the first ever released by Ol Pejeta, indicates the northern white rhino conservation is facing financial and biological challenges.
