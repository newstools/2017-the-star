The chairman of the Livestock Marketing Council, Dubat Amey, has said there is a likelihood of poll-related violence in Garissa if security agencies don&rsquo;t contain aspirants inciting communities.Speaking to the press in Garissa town yesterday, Amey said unlike the previous elections where residents voted on a clan basis, the scenario has changed.Parties are likely to influence the voting patterns. &ldquo;We have never witnessed post-election violence in Garissa and by extension Northeastern. But today there are people who want to burn this county,&rdquo; he said.Amey threatened to name those involved if the security agents don&rsquo;t act. He said some leaders are using lyricists to compose coded abusive Somali folk songs to incite and in most cases result in violence.&ldquo;We will not allow a few individuals to plunge the county into violence because of their selfish political ambitions,&rdquo; Amey said.He urged the electorate to vote for visionary leaders who have their interest at heart. &ldquo;Kenyans have become wiser and this time round bad leaders will not use their ill-gotten wealth to get into office,&rdquo; Amey said.The elder said the security agents should be proactive in dealing with all the signs that may advance violence. He singled out Garissa township because of its cosmopolitan nature. It hosts virtually all the Somali clans and other communities from outside the county.
