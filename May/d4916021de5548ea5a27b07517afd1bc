A former Water Trust Fund Board member who lost in the Embu JP senator nominations has decided to run for MP as an independent. Geoffrey Ruku (pictured) lost to former Cooperative Development Minister Njeru Ndwiga. He had 30,183 against Ndwiga&rsquo;s 56,305. Ruku contested the results, but his case was dismissed. He has now joined the Mbeere North MP race.
