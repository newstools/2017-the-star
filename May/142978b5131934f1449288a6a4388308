Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua on Tuesday said he only supports President Uhuru Kenyatta &mdash; not the Jubilee Party.Mutua said that like his own party, Jubilee has candidates competing for different positions in Machakos county, including for governor.&ldquo;Thus it is impossible to support a competing party. I only want to work with leaders with whom we share common ideals,&rdquo; Mutua said. &ldquo;We as a party [MCC] have agreed to support President Uhuru&rsquo;s bid for a second term, but we are neither in the Jubilee nor NASA coalitions. We are independent,&rdquo; the governor said.Mutua was speaking during a series of meetings in Mua, Ngelani, Mutituni and at a rally in Machakos town.He was accompanied by aspirants running on the MCC ticket.He said Uhuru has pledged to involve MCC in the next government through sharing of positions.&ldquo;We will benefit from appointments to senior positions in the national government,&rdquo; he said.Mutua accused his opponents of lacking agendas, citing his main rival Wavinya Ndeti.
