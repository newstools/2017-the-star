Lugari MP Ayub Savula has said ANC leader and NASA founder Musalia Mudavadi will &ldquo;automatically succeed NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga in 2022&rdquo;.He said the Luhya community will support Raila to the last man to ensure he wins the presidency so that Mudavadi can take over from him after five years.&ldquo;If Luhyas vote for Raila, Mudavadi will, by virtue of proximity, inherit Raila&rsquo;s Nyanza political base in 2022. It must be known that NASA is Mudavadi&rsquo;s brainchild,&rdquo; Savula said.&ldquo;Luhyas will play a key role in the NASA administration and this sets the stage for a Luhya presidency after Raila.&rdquo;He spoke after launching his reelection campaign at his Manyonyi residence on Friday.Savula said Luhyas have the numbers to propel the ANC leader to the presidency.He added that Mudavadi will win the NASA presidential nominations against Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka.Savula said NASA will triumph over Jubilee in August.He said Jubilee does not have any space for Luhyas, adding that JP leaders from the community are wasting their time and will be voted out.The legislator said the Jubilee administration has frustrated development projects in Lugari constituency after he declined to join the party.&ldquo;I was a friend of Ruto and even used to have dinner with him at his Sugoi home. But he cheated me that he would ensure roads are tarmacked in this area,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Nothing has happened. If you go to his home constituency there are tarmacked roads all over.&rdquo;Savula said NASA has made room for UDP leader Cyrus Jirongo.His succession sentiments come after Kitui Governor Julius Malombe last week said Kalonzo&rsquo;s standing in NASA will enable him to win the presidency in 2022.&ldquo;We will support him as Deputy President and presidential candidate in 2022 as Raila will not run then,&rdquo; he said.However, political analysts say the emerging premature positioning by the Mudavadi and Kalonzo camps could derail the NASA presidential campaigns.They advise the affiliate parties to first focus on the August 8 election.The alliance&rsquo;s principals have assured that there will be no room for slip-ups as they mount campaigns to kick out President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s administration.
