Kimutai denied claims the board plans to increase levies.He said the process of increasing levies &ldquo;is tedious&rdquo;.&ldquo;First, there has to be application to the regulator. The tariff will be studied, compiled and taken back to the regulator. It will then be brought to the public for scrutiny,&rdquo; he said.Kimutai added that new rates have to be justified before they can be gazetted.He said they don&rsquo;t intend to make profit, but rather recover operation costs and the service development loan.&ldquo;We need cash to develop infrastructure,&rdquo; he said.
