Leading dairy processor New Kenya Co-operative Creameries yesterday announced a reduction in retail prices for 500ml milk packet by 16.67 per cent. This will see the pack retail at Sh50 from Sh60 effective today in general trade and on Thursday in the supermarkets. “The reduction has been made possible by the slow but gradual increase in raw milk supply that is now up by 20 per cent as a result of the onset of rainfall being experienced in the major milk producing areas,” the milk processor said in a statement to newsrooms. The country experienced a biting drought since the fourth quarter of 2016 which pushed food prices to fresh highs. That followed a reduction in milk supplies to factories by half. The poor weather conditions affected the producer price, pushing it up from Sh30 to a new high of Sh43 per litre.
