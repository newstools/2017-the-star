The Court of Appeal yesterday directed persons co-accused in a graft case against former Kenya Pipeline Company MD Charles Tanui to state whether they want to be enjoined in the appeal proceedings.Judges Philip Waki, Roslyn Nambuye and Kathurima M&rsquo;inoti also ordered that the appeal be heard within 45 days.Tanui alone filed an appeal against his prosecution, stating the High Court that ordered he stands trial &ldquo;did not give me a hearing at all when it pronounced itself that the matter goes for full trial.&rdquo;The Court of Appeal has agreed to hear a consent the parties in the case have entered to have the matter returned to the High Court for adjudication.Tanui is charged alongside former Juja MP George Thuo&rsquo;s widow Judy Thuo, her company Redline Ltd and four KPC officials, over a fraudulent payment of Sh28 million in a phantom tender at KPC for the installation of transformers.Judy had been charged alongside her son Ian Gichuhi, who was later absolved of blame.They had been accused of receiving Sh28.5 million from Kenya Pipeline.Judy has denied receiving payment by fraudulently acquiring public property.The four KPC bigwigs denied abuse of office, false documentation and irregular payments violating procurement laws.Former KPC chief engineer Josphat Sirma and chief technical manager Elias Karumi are accused of making an irregular payment to Redline for the installation, testing and commissioning of auto-transformers on the basis of falsified documents.They are out on Sh350,000 bail each.State counsel Joseph Riungu has opposed the appeal on grounds that &ldquo;the trial court is the best forum to hear and evaluate the evidence tendered and the merit of any defence placed&rdquo;.He wants it dismissed.&ldquo;The trial court is best equipped to deal with the quality and sufficiency of the evidence gathered to support the charge sheet,&rdquo; Riungu said in submissions.
