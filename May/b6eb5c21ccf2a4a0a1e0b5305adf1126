Turkana Governor Josphat Nanok has said he differed with Senator John Munyes because of his continued criticism of his administration for no valid reason.&ldquo;We differed with my senator after he started interfering with the way I run the county government. He has been pursuing his selfish interests instead of questioning how county funds are spent,&rdquo; Nanok said.He said Munyes wanted to benefit from funds meant for county projects.&ldquo;Munyes has perfected [the art] as a Member of Parliament where CDF money meant for construction of projects would end up in his pockets. I stood firm in protection of these funds and it is from this point that we parted ways and he went on to join Jubilee,&rdquo; he said.Speaking at Morulem, Turkana East, on Sunday, the Governor said his rejection of the senator&rsquo;s plan to divert budgetary allocations meant for projects to benefit a few individuals led to their parting of ways.The governor accused Munyes, who has since declared his interest for Turkana governor, of remaining silent on key issues affecting Turkana residents.&ldquo;Turkana residents are attacked by bandits in Kapedo, Morulem, Kang&rsquo;irisai, Kochodin, Kainuk, Kotaruk, Lokichoggio, Todonya and our senator has never spoken about it because he doesn&rsquo;t care about it,&rdquo; Nanok said.He asked residents to elect ODM senator nominee Malik Ekal in August as he is ready to work with him.Munyes was unavailable for comment as his phone was switched off.
