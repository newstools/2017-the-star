The current maize shortage in Kenya and within East Africa could improve due to good harvests across the region.This is despite the high price of maize in Kenya, which has increased the cost of a two-kilo packet of maize flour to Sh180.The Eastern Africa Grain Council April-September cross-border trade outlook shows the availability of maize in the region is expected to improve because of the forthcoming July-September harvests in parts of Kenya, Somalia and South Sudan.This is in addition to the June-July harvests in Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and the May-August harvest in Tanzania. Gerald Masila, the EAGC chief executive, yesterday said the harvest will vary from below to near-average. He attributed this to mixed rainfall performance and crop infestation by the fall armyworm. &ldquo;Prices of maize are expected to decline seasonally in many parts of the region from June, but the decrease in prices will likely be moderated by high domestic and regional demand to replenish depleted stocks,&rdquo; he said.There is a high likelihood of trade in low-quality maize because of a rush to cash in on the early harvest while prices are high.This, Masila said, may lead to elevated levels of aflatoxin in most of the maize that will be traded at the beginning of the season.A 90kg bag of maize in Nairobi is retailing at Sh5,349, Sh6,241 in Kisumu, Sh6,687 in Mombasa and Sh4,458 in Eldoret. In Uganda, the same bag of maize is retailing at Sh4,579 in Kampala, Busia and Tororo.According to the outlook, the total amount of maize grain traded in the region by March 2017 for the July 2016 to June 2017 production and marketing period was 426,000 tonnes.This was 66 per cent below the recent four-year average which was attributed to exceptional tight supplies because of below-average harvest in most countries, the outlook says.
