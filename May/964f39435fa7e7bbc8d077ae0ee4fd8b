Bungoma senator aspirants have promised to give incumbent Moses Wetang'ula a run for his money on poll day should he defend his seat as announced.The announcement that Wetang'ula will seek re-election was made by Ford Kenya Bungoma secretary Peter Wakhuleka, who said it was a done deal.Wetang'ula will relinquish his seat, in the event that the National Super Alliance forms the next government, to take the position of deputy prime minister.The Ford Kenya chief was not immediately available for comment and some sections of the media have quoted deputy leader Boni Khalwale as denying the report.More on this: NASA principal Wetang'ula will vie for re-election as Bungoma Senator - Ford KenyaBonny Nyongesa, ODM aspirant for the seat, said Wetang'ula lacks clout in the political scene and will face him as an equal, not a NASA principal.&ldquo;Whereas we are alive to the fact that it his democratic right, we are going to treat him not as a principal but as a competitor. We are ready to punch him hard," he said in a phone interview with The Star on Sunday.Nyongesa, a former Royal Media journalist, said Wetang'ula's decision will complicate matters for the Ford Kenya team in the county as all aspirants for different seats are from his village.&ldquo;It will be interesting to see how Wetang&rsquo;ula who hails from Kabuchai, his Ford Kenya governor candidate Wycliffe Wangamati and woman representative Catherine Wambilianga all hail from the same place."Bungoma county is larger than a village,&rdquo; he said.Nyongesa said they will replay voices of the senator vowing to never return to vie for the "small seat" after launching his presidential bid.He said they will do so for the people know their senator plays politics of deceit.Jubilee aspirant Juma Mukhwana laughed off the declaration saying it was a slap on the faces of residents who believed their leader had carved out a niche in national politics.&ldquo;Did Wetang&rsquo;ula launch a presidential bid that saw youths die only to vie for senator?" he asked.More on this: Raila skips Wetang'ula presidential bid launch at Muliro GardensAlso read: Wetangula forgives Oparanya for disrupting his presidential bid launch at Muliro GardensMukhwana said it is clear the Ford Kenya boss is not confident the National Super Alliance will win the presidency and that the promise he will becomedeputy prime minister was a farce.He told Wetang'ula to prepare for a humiliating defeat as he failed Bungoma residents by focusing on his presidential ambitions that will not come to pass.
