There is confusion in Kwale after ODM&rsquo;s national appeal tribunal withdrew certificates awarded to governor and Msambweni parliamentary &lsquo;winners&rsquo; on Saturday.Governor aspirant Issah Chipera and Msambweni MP Suleiman Dori had been declared winners.The tribunal also directed the ODM National Elections Board to set a date for a repeat of the exercise in the seven polling stations in Kwale.The decision was made after ODM governor aspirant Sammy Ruwa and Msambweni MP aspirant Omar Boga successfully appealed the results of the primaries. Matano Keah, a voter at Mwaroni polling station, said if the nominations are not be repeated, ODM leader Raila Odinga should not blame the region for the political stand they will take.&ldquo;We know you are the NASA flagbearer but we are very sorry if this issue is not resolved. We don&rsquo;t want Mombasa to interfere with our affairs,&rdquo; he said. Jesino Masinza, a voter, said it will be difficult for Raila to win the election if justice is not served. &ldquo;You are the NASA flagbearer and your house is leaking down here, how will you become president?&rdquo; he said.Halima Juma, a resident, said if they are denied a chance to send home leaders they don&rsquo;t want at the nominations, they will punish them at the general election. &ldquo;We will meet our opponent at the ballot,&rdquo; she said.Jermaine Kashi asked why other wards have nominated their leaders except Bongwe. Pamela Achieng, a voter in Msambweni, questioned why they are being told to vote, yet the party leadership is not playing its part.Saumu Mwacharumbu, a resident, said they will not allow Mombasa politicians to influence their choices.&ldquo;We are ready for anything. He [Raila] should tell us if he has Kwale votes or he depends on Sultan votes,&rdquo; she said.
