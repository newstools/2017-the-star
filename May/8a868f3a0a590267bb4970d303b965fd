Conservationists have raised concerns over the proposed construction of dams on Mara River and its tributaries.East African Wild Life Society said it received an alert from Serengeti Watch, one of their conservation partners in Tanzania, that authorities in Kenya have proposed the building of dams.EAWLS executive director Julius Kamau raised the concerns in a statement. &ldquo;As this is a potentially important trans-boundary issue that could have immense negative impact on the Mara-Serengeti Ecosystem, EAWLS is with Serengeti Watch, Kenya Wildlife Conservancies Association and Maasai Mara Wildlife Conservancies Association, gathering more information to ascertain the true situation,&rdquo; he said. Kamau said Mara, a trans-boundary issue, causes a high likelihood that the East African Community agreement could be invoked to ensure a joint approval or disapproval by the Kenyan and Tanzanian authorities.He said according to the information from the Alliance of Leading Environmental Researchers and Thinkers, a group of highly respected academics and writers, Kenya has proposed major new dams on the Mara River or its key tributaries. The proposed dams include a 10-metre high Norera dam, mainly for irrigation and a 65 metre-high Amala Dam, deep in the Mau Forest, for hydropower. He said one or two dams that are 30 to 70 metres high each and on the Nyangores River, a key Mara tributary, mainly for irrigation are the other proposed dams.Kamau said Tanzania has also proposed the Borenga Dam, though it would be set up further downstream on the Mara, past the Serengeti. The Serengeti ecosystem &mdash; made up of the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, Masai Mara Reserve in Kenya, and the adjoining game-controlled areas &mdash; has only one year-round river, the Mara.
