State-owned National Bank of Kenya is banking on diversification of products to help grow revenue streams amid interest controls following the enforcement of the Banking (Amendment) Act in September 2016.Managing director Wilfred Musau said the lender will focus its investment strategy on bancassurance, custody and fund management, and IT system. &ldquo;We have been able to review our business model, and looked at diversifying various areas of our products and innovation,&rdquo; Musau said after the bank&rsquo;s annual general meeting at the KICC on Friday. During the AGM, shareholders approved the plan to issue one bonus share for every ten held. Issue of 30.79 million bonus shares, at Sh5 each, is expected to raise Sh153.99 million to shore up NBK&rsquo;s dwindling capital base. &ldquo;We are grateful to our shareholders for approving the bonus share as this shows the level of confidence they have in the future of National Bank,&rdquo; chairman Mohamed Hassan said. The lender has resorted to bonus share because the National Treasury and the National Social Security Fund &ndash; the largest shareholders with a combined 70.55 per cent stake &ndash; have failed to agree on proposed Sh13 billion rights issue. The cash call was approved at an AGM in June 2013, but has stalled due to the impasse. Musau has, in the meantime, lauded President Kenyatta for signing the Movable Property Security Rights Bill 2017 into law on May 11, resulting in admission of items such as machinery, furniture, vehicles included to the collateral register.
