Jubilee Party officials from the Mt Kenya region have accused the party&rsquo;s secretariat of sidelining them and failing to efficiently facilitate them.The 190 officials, who met in Murang&rsquo;a on Wednesday, said the party&rsquo;s secretariat headed by Raphael Tuju has been acting as if it owns the party and disregarding the officials who were elected by aspirants.The officials have now formed the Mt Kenya Jubilee Party Officials Caucus now. They say they want to meet party President Uhuru Kenyatta.Chairman Alhaji Mwendia said Tuju is undermining their constitutional roles yet he is just an employee of the party.&ldquo;The Jubilee Party headquarters has been very economical with information and we want Tuju and his team to know that they are just employees of the party unlike us who are not paid to do what we do,&rdquo; he said.Mwendia said they have received complaints from many people who claim to have been asked to give bribes to some members of the secretariat to be nominated in the national and county assemblies.Lists of nominees should only come from the counties and the secretariat should not interfere with the process, he said.&ldquo;We want the party to release modalities of how the nominations lists should be drawn and communicate them to county officials by next Tuesday evening,&rdquo; Mwendia added.The officials said that if the party does not adhere to the deadline, they will storm the headquarters demanding for answers.Mwendia said officials are shocked that the party has not paid presiding officers, clerks and transporters who worked during the primaries last month.He said he reads mischief in the delayed payments and insinuated that some party officials may be trying to steal the money.&ldquo;If these people are not paid by Tuesday, then we will have to visit Tuju and find out why,&rdquo; the chairman said.The officials complained that the party has been unwilling to open county offices.&ldquo;Even our competitors have ensured they have operational county offices and we are wondering why the Jubilee Party is unable to do the same,&rdquo; Mwendia said.The officials also complained that the party sidelined the lists of county coordinators that they submitted as required by the party&rsquo;s constitution and instead chose to hire other people.They demanded the firing of those coordinators to give room for county officials to submit new names for the positions.
