A Kisumu court has acquitted Kitutu Chache South MP Richard Onyonka of all charges of misuse of the CDF and evading tax in a Sh21 million purchase of sugar.Onyonka had denied being part of a tax evasion conspiracy that culminated in the non-payment of Sh21 million after purchase of sugar from Chemelil Sugar Company in 2008.In the case, it was suspected that the funds used to buy the sugar were drawn from the constituency development fund and distributed to IDPs in his constituency in 2009.The prosecution had earlier told the court that Onyonka and another suspect failed to remit the amount to the Kenya Revenue Authority for the purchase.The court was also told that Onyonka, using his position as the CDF patron, conferred the Sh21 million to James Siro &ldquo;by causing Chemelil Sugar Company Limited to sell sugar purportedly to Kitutu Chache CDF at a price less Value Added Tax&rdquo;.Onyonka was charged with conspiring to commit an economic crime, conspiring to defraud the public and abuse of office on or about April 23, 2008.Senior principal magistrate Thomas Obutu acquitted him on Friday.The court found that Kitutu Chache CDF never purchased sugar and neither did Onyonka himself, hence the tax evasion case could not stand.Onyonka said he was happy the eight-year case has been concluded.He thanked his constituency for supporting him.
