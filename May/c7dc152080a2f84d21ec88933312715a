ACK Archbishop Jackson ole Sapit has urged clerics eyeing the Murang&rsquo;a bishop seat to seek support with humility to avoid causing conflict in the church.He said the only way for aspirants to ensure they get support is by respecting themselves and others, and through prayer.Sapit said it is impossible for leaders to impose themselves on people, adding the will of the masses will always win.He spoke at Murang&rsquo;a ACK on Saturday, during the farewell ceremony of interim Bishop Allan Waithaka, who has served the diocese since November last year after elections failed.Waithaka was appointed by former Archbishop Eliud Wabukala after elections held following the retirement of Bishop Isaac Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a were postponed indefinitely.Eleven contenders vied for the seat, and three made the shortlist after being vetted by a panel made up of 11 members - six from the diocese and five from the archbishop&rsquo;s office - during the election that started last August. The three finalists were Wilson Burugu, the diocese education secretary, Archdeacon Timothy Gichere and Venerable John Karumwa.However, some contestants and clergymen said the process was not fair and asked the archbishop to nullify it and call fresh elections.One of the aspirants went to court to block the election, claiming it was unfair. Sapit said hopefuls should let people identify their leadership gifts.&ldquo;It is unfortunate that even in the church, power has become everything. It has become more intoxicating than alcohol and more addictive than drugs,&rdquo; he said.Sapit said when power is sought without God&rsquo;s guidence, problems are bound to be encountered.He said the kind of bishop the church is looking for is one who will seek the support of faithful and set a good example by being humble.&ldquo;We need a leader who will show he is willing to listen to God and wait upon God&rsquo;s power to guide and lead the people of the diocese,&rdquo; Sapit said.He urged aspirants seeking political seats to concede defeat if they lose.
