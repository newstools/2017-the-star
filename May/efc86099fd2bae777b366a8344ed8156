Although a number of nomination results were cancelled and election results reversed, party primaries were largely rigged.And that the nominations could look so badly organised, and so much at the mercy of riggers, who also happened to be in charge, was a very big shame to party leadership and our democracy.Jubilee nominations were repeated on April 25 after the first attempt on April 21 failed. It was, however, shameful that more sophisticated rigging happened in the second round because those in charge of the elections at various levels still dared to rig again, using all manner of excuses.Having observed that some candidates had been bribing voters to elect them for a long time without the government intervening, timely fears were expressed that worse rigging was bound to undermine free, fair, credible and transparent nominations by candidates who bribed voters left, right and centre.These fears were, however, dismissed by those planning to rig as rattling of alarmists, doomsayers and losers, who were trying to justify a loss of election that they knew was coming. Sad to say, it has taken an electoral tragedy to prove these fears right and justify them.Members of the Jubilee Party were also disappointed by assurances of secretary general Raphael Tuju that they would organise free and fair elections. Having assured people that even without the IEBC all would be well, everything should have been done to ensure that Tuju&rsquo;s assurances were not sabotaged or put to shame.But while rigging in these elections might be denied, there is enough evidence of deliberate and beneficial tampering of the electoral process to the benefit of some aspirants. Without rigging, the process would never have collapsed as it did on first attempt.For example, in many areas countrywide, many ballot boxes were stuffed with marked ballot papers, vehicles belonging to aspirants transported ballot boxes, erasable ink was used by voters who voted more than 10 times in different polling stations, persons related to aspirants were used as presiding officers, while fake figures replaced those that came from polling stations. This is how some aspirants were given same figures in different polling stations.Equally, many young voters who registered as voters after the 2013 General Election were not allowed to vote.In some party offices, marked ballot papers were found in sealed ballot boxes marked in favour of preferred aspirants. This is despite assurances from President Uhuru Kenyatta that neither he nor Deputy President William Ruto had preferred candidates. How had these ballot boxes been unsealed, stuffed with marked ballot papers and re-sealed?In one room I visited in at Kiamaina, Bahati, ballot boxes had no seals and ballot papers were scattered all over, many seeming to have been taken away. Some individuals were caught by angry voters carrying marked ballot papers for certain candidates but no action was taken against them.In many areas, ballot boxes were delivered late when tired voters had already gone home or to their work stations.Contrary to assurances by Tuju, ballot papers had no watermarks that would have made them foolproof against copying, which was used as standard in repeated nominations.Tragically, many people have blamed DP Ruto as the force behind all the alleged rigging as a means of establishing his governing network all over the country.Most worrying, however, is how rigging seems not to be taken as crime for government to arrest or investigate. In fact, those who rigged are nevertheless assured of party nomination tickets as if they never did anything wrong or criminal. Are there no laws that forbid rigging of nomination elections?To ensure free, fair and credible polls at the August 8 General Election, rigging in nominations should have been avoided, criminalised and people assured that electoral malpractices will be punished.It is reassuring that next elections will be conducted by the IEBC, whose officers should be assured as early as now that if they rig next elections, they will be punished according to the law.But the government should also be informed that the best thing to do will be to esure the polls will be free and fair or there will be dire consequences for everyone. In any case, we have been in the Armageddon before and we should never go back there again.In the meantime, people who helped collapse the nominations should be investigated and punished according to the law.
