These are then taken to the commission before deadline to be processed for any legal issues.Monday is the official deadlineIEBC communications director Andrew Limo said yesterday was not the official deadline for the submission of the forms and symbols.

He added that this will allow the commission time to go through the documents.The commission&rsquo;s rules state that an independent candidate should not join any party at least three months to the election.Before the extension was announced, aspirants who spoke to the Star at Lion Place, Westlands, Nairobi, raised concern regarding the deadline.Don&rsquo;t lock us out of polls&ldquo;I am worried that if the IEBC maintains today&rsquo;s deadline many of us will be locked out,&rdquo; Sheila Wanjiku, an aspirant for Nakuru woman representative, said.&ldquo;I have been here since Tuesday but I am yet to be cleared.&rdquo;Another aspirant who did not want to be named said an extension would be fair.Joshua Ngale, a commissioner at the registrar&rsquo;s office, said the number of candidates was overwhelming.&ldquo;We have cleared 3,000 candidates so far but the number is still overwhelming. We hope the IEBC can extend the deadline so that we serve everyone,&rdquo; he said.More than 1,200 people had signed up as independents by last Friday evening, she said, a four-fold increase compared to 2013.Hundreds more were registered on Tuesday.
