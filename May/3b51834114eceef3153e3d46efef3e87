Nakuru Governor Kinuthia Mbugua will vie for re-election as an independent candidate after losing the Jubilee Party primaries to Lee Kinyanjui. Mbugua has chosen a flamboyant MP aspirant, who lost the Jubilee nominations for Kuresoi South, as his running mate. Peter Rutto is a former finance manager and an ally of Deputy President William Ruto and Energy CS Charles Keter. Rutto made the announcement on Friday, just an hour after Mbugua addressed a press conference in the outskirts of Nakuru town. “This is a new page in my life. I promise to transform the entire county just as I have been dreaming,” he said, adding he had made up his mind. The aspirant told the Star by phone that they decided to go independent as they did not get tickets. “I know the problems the people of Nakuru are facing. We only seek the opportunity to serve them," he said. He added: "Our candidature does not mean we are against President Uhuru Kenyatta and Ruto. We are solidly behind their re-election." Rutto gained fame after he erected a billboard in Keringet town and murramed more than 200 kms of roads in the constituency. Resident Samson Korir said: "We will support Rutto...no other leader in this county means well for the people." Mbugua dropped Deputy Governor Joseph Rutto after he decided to remain in Jubilee party. Rutto is likely to sway supporters of Kinyanjui and his running mate Erick Korir. Kinyanjui won the nomination with 216,387 votes against Mbugua's 150,137.
