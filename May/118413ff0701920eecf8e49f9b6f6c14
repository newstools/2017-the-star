The state-owned Kisumu's Sunset hotel risks being auctioned over un-remitted Sh18 million tax to Kenya Revenue Authority.Kisumu county attorney Amos Omollo said auctioneers are expected to effect the KRA agency notice on the tax arrears.Tourism Finance Cooperation holds a majority of shares at the facility while the county government has around 5% share.Omollo said the auctioneers wanted to sell off the movable assets in the hotel."So far, we have talked to the auctioneers and agreed that the matter will be resolved amicably in the next 10 to 15 days."He added that they further agreed that no goods should be collected from the hotel until the matter is handled.Omollo said there was an allegation that VAT collected by the hotel had not been remitted to the taxman."We are sure that the undisputed amount is Sh11 million. The Sh18 million is as a result of penalties," he said on Thursday.The hotel's accounts will be reconciled to ascertain the payments that may have been made in the period of the KRA's claim.The hotel, which as a popular joint for tourists visiting Kisumu, has been grappling with low bed occupancy for the last 15 years. "The county and national governments should find a solution to the problem so that we restore the hotel's lost glory," Omollo said.Sunset Hotel has dilapidated structures hence not attractive to tourists especially with the competition brought about by the growing number of hotels in Kisumu.The hotel currently earns Sh2 million in a month but has a recurrent expenditure stretching beyond Sh5 million."The business is extremely down due to competition from various hotels within the county," Joseph Odiwour, the manager, said."There is a need for urgent renovation so that we compete with the others in getting clients."Sunset Hotel is currently competing with hotels like Acacia, Imperial, Sovereign, Kisumu Hotel, Milimani Resort, Le Savana, Pine Cone among others.Read: Kisumu Ber: City that offers scenic sites, tasty food and modern hotels
