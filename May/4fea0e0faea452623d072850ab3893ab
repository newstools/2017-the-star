Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho has said the ferry scare has vindicated him from being bashed over calls for a bridge at the Likoni channel.MV Nyayo, the biggest and oldest ferry, developed mechanical problems on Tuesday before it was pushed by heavy tides towards the deep sea.There were more than 1,000 commuters on board, a situation the Governor said had most of the residents worried.Speaking at the scene where a wall collapsed on a house at Mbaraki on Monday, Joho said most countries have invested in bridges to avert ferry troubles.[VIDEO] Ferry breaks down with passengers on board, pushed by tides towards deep seaHe took a swipe at the national government saying it has blocked the county&rsquo;s attempt to build a bridge at the channel.The Governor hit at President Uhuru Kenyatta who launched the resumption of ferry services across the Mtongwe channel on March 13."I mean, come on man, 54 years after independence and we are still stuck in the same conversation? We need to move forward.""This is the conversation I have always wanted to have. Globally, no one thinks of rebuilding ferry channels." He said so many investors have expressed interest in entering into a concession agreement with the state so as to put up the bridge."If we had focused on building a bridge across the channel to South Coast, we would not have this conversationtoday," Joho said.On April 26, a pontoon at the channel was swept away by Indian Ocean waves, disrupting the ferry services which are yet to resume.On Tuesday, Joho said: "The Mtongwe ferry that was famously launched by the President is no more. It can&rsquo;t function."He said it is time for ferry services management and concerned authorities need to think outside the box."Let us think about how we can build a bridge in Likoni so we don&rsquo;t keep coming back for discussions on how to save lives," he said.On Tuesday, Kenya Ferry Services managing director Bakari Gowa said they will only offer services to passengers.Motorists have been banned from crossing the channel, a situation likely to inconvenience hundreds of residents.Read: Ferrying of Motorists at Likoni, Mtongwe suspended after overflow of water
