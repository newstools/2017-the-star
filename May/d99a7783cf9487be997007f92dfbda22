The never-ending financial constraints at National Super League side Nairobi City Stars has forced head coach Robert Matano to decamp to fellow strugglers Bidco FC.Matano, a Kenyan Premier League title with Sofapaka in 2009 and who has also coached former champions AFC Leopards and Ulinzi Stars said the playing unit and technical bench at City Stars has endured a four month period without pay and he couldn&rsquo;t take it anymore.He said the lack of financial support had affected the morale of the team, leading to a string of poor performances that have left them 13th on the log with 14 points from a possible 33.&ldquo;Going without pay for four months is not easy for me and the players. We haven&rsquo;t received our salaries and allowances since January and this has greatly affected the morale of the players. I need money for my survival and failing to pay me means I should source for it elsewhere. I had no choice other than accepting Bidco&rsquo;s offer.&rdquo;In the eleven matches Matano was in charge of City Stars, the team registered just three wins, five draws and three losses.A move to Bidco, who are second from last in the standings with five points and four places down from City Stars clearly indicates Matano&rsquo;s desire for an escape route.His departure leaves team manager Neville Pudo and long-serving player, John Amboko, in charge, though on temporary basis. At Bidco Matano replaces Yusuf Chipo who was asked to step down following a string of dismal displays that has left the team staring at the relegation barrel.On the huge task of improving Bidco&rsquo;s prospects, Matano said: &ldquo;For now, I cannot promise great changes since I haven&rsquo;t worked with the team for long but in the second leg, I will strengthen the squad by bringing in new players and rectifying on what my predecessor got wrong.&rdquo;
