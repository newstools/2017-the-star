The ground has completely shifted and the community is solidly behind Raila&rsquo;s presidential bid,&rdquo; said Bosire, the ODM national treasurer.His sentiments were shared by Ongeri who was President Uhuru&rsquo;s point man in Kisii in 2013.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see them [Jubilee Party] getting even 10 per cent here. I&rsquo;m always on the side that forms government and we shall work extra hard to ensure that Raila becomes President,&rdquo; Ongeri said. The move by Ongeri to quit JP added fresh impetus to NASA. He will run for Kisii senator.Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi also returned to ODM after a short stint in JP.Earlier, the opposition suffered a blow after Senator Chris Obure and Bomachoge Chache MP Simon Ogari defected to JP.Ongwae, who is Raila&rsquo;s point man in Kisii, said the region is &ldquo;100 per cent in NASA&rdquo;.&ldquo;There is a wrong notion that JP is gaining ground here. We are firmly in NASA and this will be confirmed on August 8,&rdquo; he said.Fight for a NASA winNyagarama said, &ldquo;We are ready to fight until the end to ensure that Raila becomes the President of this county.&rdquo;After the leaders had spoken, Raila said, &ldquo;The Kisii people have made a strong statement that this is a NASA stronghold and people are tired with Jubilee. However, we are not yet there. On August 8, ensure you turn out in large numbers to send them home.&rdquo;Raila said JP should be completely locked out of the region.Earlier, at a meeting in Kisii Sports Club, Raila said NASA is targeting at least 2.5 million votes in his Nyanza stronghold and 1.5 million in Western.Raila and his running mate Kalonzo Musyoka downplayed the rivalry between NASA parties in the region.&ldquo;The rivalry in the governor, senator, MP and woman rep seats is like friendly fire, which should not distract us from our main target of removing Jubilee from power,&rdquo; Kalonzo said.
