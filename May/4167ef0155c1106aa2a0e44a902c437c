Civil society groups in Rift Valley have written to EACC chairman Eliud Wabukala, demanding transfer of commission staff in Eldoret for alleged laxity in fighting graft.Programmes Officer at the Center for Human Rights and Democracy Kipkorir Ngetich says the EACC office has failed.Ngetich said some of the EACC staff may have been compromised by governors and other county staff involved in irregular practices. He said the EACC staff must also be investigated.&ldquo;We have given Wabukala the names of officers we believe are involved in protecting graft barons in counties and we will be expecting action immediately,&rdquo; Ngetich said.He said they had also copied the same communication to Deputy Director of the EACC Enock Otiko, in charge of the Eldoret office. &ldquo;We have hundreds of cases reported but no action is ever taken. We think Wabukala should open a new chapter by having all the officers removed from the Eldoret office,&rdquo; Otiko said. Ngetich said residents from the North Rift region travel to Nairobi to report graft cases.
