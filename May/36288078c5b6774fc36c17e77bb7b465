A 25-year-old woman is appealing to well-wishers for funds to treat her one-year-old son&rsquo;s tumour on his forehead. He was born with the growth, which has been getting larger.Mary Wangari told the Star she gave birth at the Murang&rsquo;a General Hospital. But doctors referred her to Kenyatta National Hospital to treat the growth.Six months later, he had not improved.Wangari says she visited Kijabe Hospital and was informed her son has a hole in his head.&ldquo;They charged me Sh1.5 million to have the hole filled and the growth removed, which I could not afford,&rdquo; she said. Wangari said the growth, which now hangs over his nose, obstructs her son&rsquo;s breathing and has made him go blind.It has also stunted Maagu&rsquo;s development because he does not eat well.&ldquo;I am pleading with well-wishers to help me save my baby&rsquo;s life and give him a normal life,&rdquo; she said.Wangari said she and her husband are casual labourers.Wangari says the money raised from fundraisers only cater for her son&rsquo;s medical check-ups.
