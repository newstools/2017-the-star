While the rains have come as a blessing for some, others are counting losses.Last week, nearly 2,000 animals were swept away by heavy rains in Boru, Malgis, Larq and North Horr in Marsabit county. This has been attributed to the sudden temperature changes from a dry spell to heavy rains.The Kenya Red Cross reported that cars were washed away along the Banisa-Mandera road, but no injuries or deaths were reported. In Nyeri county, 14 families were displaced during a landslide. A 10-year-old boy was carried away and killed by floods as he looked after cattle in Kirinyaga county.Red Cross last week warned residents of Meru, Kirinyaga and Murang&rsquo;a counties on the danger of landslides and flooding. Transportation has been affected as several roads have been destroyed and bridges washed away. Transport along the Kongoni-Maella road in Naivasha has been disrupted for two days after heavy rains swept off a section of the road near Gondi trading centre. As a result, farm produce worth thousands of shillings is going to waste.Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organisation director general Eliud Kireger yesterday said even though the meteorological department had reported that the March-May-April long rains will be near normal, the rains experienced in the last two weeks have been good for maize crops in the North Rift.&ldquo;Most farmers are weeding their maize. Apart from the fall armyworm attack which can be controlled through continuous spraying, farmers are looking forward to a healthy harvest this season,&rdquo; he said.Kireger added, &ldquo;The fertiliser came on time this season and farmers are hoping the top dressing will also be available on time.&rdquo;He said the heavy rains have suppressed the armyworm attack, but this does not mean the threat is over.&ldquo;If the weather changes again, the armyworm can still cause a lot of havoc so farmers should continue monitoring their maize crops and spray to control the pest. However, this is an extra cost for the farmers, and it is very expensive. The ministry should look for ways to help farmers in containing this deadly pest.&rdquo;
