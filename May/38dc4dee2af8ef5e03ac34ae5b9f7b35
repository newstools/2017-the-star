Governor, MP, deputy governor or MCA candidates risk spending six years in jail or a fine of Sh2 million if found guilty of using state resources to seek reelection.Part of the IEBC&rsquo;s mandate is to ensure leaders do not use public resources in the cause of their campaign.In The Handbook on Election Security launched on Tuesday, the IEBC and other stakeholders outlined that it is a crime to use resources from companies or corporations where the government has a controlling interest.&ldquo;This information is to be supplied to the commission within 14 days from the day the notice of request is put across and before the campaigns kick off,&rdquo; the handbook reads.The IEBC, through a notice, had asked all state officers to provide information on the state resources they had access to by May 2.&ldquo;Penalty on those found guilty will include a fine not exceeding Sh2 million or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six years,&rdquo; the Handbook reads.However, it is not clear how many have complied.Speaking on Tuesday during the launch of the Handbook, IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati said the commission is keen to adhere to the election laws.&ldquo;We are working with the National Police Service and all other stakeholders to fulfill our mandate, which is to run a free, fair and credible election,&rdquo; he said.
