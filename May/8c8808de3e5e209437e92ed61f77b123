Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi (pictured) wants to make amends with some ODM aspirants after a falling out during the primaries. Some aspirants have been accusing Kingi of favouring hopefuls, such as MP Willy Mtengo, during nominations. On Thursday, Kingi urged the aspirants to bury the hatchet and work together to deliver victory for the party in the county.
