Othaya MP aspirant Gichuki Mugambi and his supporters on Sunday protested in Othaya town against what they said was manipulation of nomination results by incumbent Mary Wambui.Mugambi (pictured) said Wambui visited party headquarters, where she allegedly inflated her votes to indicate she had won by 24,000 votes against Mugambi&rsquo;s 20,000. Mugambi was announced the winner.The final tally showed he had 20,228 votes, Mary Wambui 12,524, while Ndirangu Gachunia came third with 1,166 votes.&ldquo;She has even filed an appeal saying all votes were not counted. Her move has angered Othaya people because this is a clear indication that she does not respect their will,&rdquo; Mugambi said.Mugambi urged Wambui to respect the people&rsquo;s verdict. He said he has filed a complaint with JP secretary general Raphael Tuju, who promised him he will go by the results announced by the area returning officer. Mugambi rushed from Nairobi to Othaya to calm residents who had planned mass demonstrations.
