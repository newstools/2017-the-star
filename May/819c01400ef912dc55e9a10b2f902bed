Contractors who provided transport services during Jubilee Party nominations in Elgeyo Marakwet disrupted the issuance of nomination certificates in the county.This was after they stormed the party's Iten officer on Friday demanding payment for transporting election materials during the April 24 primaries.Led by Godwin Kosgei, the transporters blocked the entrance to the office using their vehicles as the meeting between nominees and county JP officials went on.Kosgei claimed some party officials in the county pocketed the money meant for transporters.He accused Barnabas Lagat, the JP coordinator in the county, of failing to pay them despite receiving the money from the party&rsquo;s headquarters in Nairobi."Something fishy is going on here. We are aware the money has been sent to county officials. We will not allow them to leave this building until they clear with us."Governor Alex Tolgos and woman representative nominee Jane Kiptoo were at the office during the standoff.The 20 transporters were demanding Sh10,000 each for the services before Governor Tolgos intervened to end the stalemateThe county boss, after a lengthy negotiation, offered to provide Sh200,000 from his pocket for payment of the unrelenting transporters.The governor had asked the transporters to give the party time to settle the payments, but his pleas fell on deaf hears."You can go and receive your nomination certificate if you have no solution to our problems. We will not allow the party officials to leave here until we are paid," Kosgei said.The ceremony which was to start at 10am kicked off at 2.30pm after Tolgos' aides brought the cash which was handed over to the contractor's team leader.Lagat said the he had the money but had not paid the contractors since some of their details had not been captured."We have captured the names of those who had not been paid. We were organising to wire the money into their accounts."Also read: You made voters reject us, Elgeyo Marakwet MCAs tell Murkomen
