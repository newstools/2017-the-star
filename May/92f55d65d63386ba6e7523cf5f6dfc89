Budalang&rsquo;i ODM nominee Raphael Wanjala has dismissed claims by his rival Andrew Nakitare that Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong helped him win the ODM nomination.He told the Star on the phone yesterday that he won fair and square, adding there was no rigging.The former legislator said the allegations are far-fetched and only meant to malign him.Nakitare on Friday told his supporters that Ojaamong influenced the outcome of the nominations in Wanjala&rsquo;s favour. He spoke at the Lunyofu grounds, where he was installed as an elder.But Wanjala said the county chief did not setfoot in the constituency during the primaries.He garnered 3,756 votes against Nakitare&rsquo;s 3,200.&ldquo;Nobody assisted me to win the ODM nomination. I managed to fly the ODM Budalang&rsquo;i parliamentary flag because I&rsquo;m still popular in the constituency,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;My supporters, who encouraged me to vie for the seat, still have confidence in me. That&rsquo;s why I got more votes than my rivals.&rdquo;Wanjala told Nakitare to honour his pre-nomination pledge that he would back whoever won, saying all hopefuls agreed to do so.&ldquo;There is no need for change of heart,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;We unanimously agreed that all the five ODM Budalang&rsquo;i MP aspirants would rally their support behind the winner to ensure the party wins. I&rsquo;m surprised some of us decided to turn against me, instead of supporting me.&ldquo;Those who lost in the nomination and have opted to challenge me as independent candidates should fight their own wars and desist from attacking me as I have nothing against them.&rdquo;Wanjala urged politicians to preach peace during their campaigns to avert violence. &ldquo;We should promote unity and tolerance.&rdquo;
