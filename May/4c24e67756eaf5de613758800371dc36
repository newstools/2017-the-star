I can assure Homa Bay residents that it will not be business as usual,&rdquo; Awiti told the Star on the phone yesterday.Reacting to the court ruling, Awiti pledged to reform his administration to improve service delivery. The governor said he won with 159, 000 votes against Kasipul MP Oyugi Magwanga&rsquo;s 89,000 and Wakiaga&rsquo;s 22,000. &ldquo;The results by 814 presiding officers were tallied, signed, and presented to court. They showed that I won,&rdquo; Awiti said.
