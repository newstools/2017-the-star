The Senate Public Accounts and Investments Committee is this morning expected to meet key state agencies to discuss what action to take against Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya for ignoring summons.The watchdog committee, chaired by Kisumu Senator Anyang&rsquo; Nyong&rsquo;o, has invited the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission, the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, the Director of Public Prosecutions, Inspector General of Police, the Controller of Budget, the Attorney General and the National Treasury to appear before them at Parliament Buildings.&ldquo;CPAIC has convened a very important meeting with key stakeholders to discuss consequences of failure to appear before the committee by Oparanya,&rdquo; reads the invite circulated among the committee members.Of the 47 governors, only Oparanya has failed to appear before the committee to explain how the county had spent money allocated to it.Senators had at some point early this year threatened to have Oparanya barred from running for reelection on August 8 if he fails to appear before them to answer to audit queries.Governor Dismissed threats to bar him from reelectionBut Oparanya dismissed the threats, saying the Senate has no powers to bar anybody from contesting because the institution has no power to clear candidates to run for office.He accused the Senate of assuming powers vested in other institutions.&ldquo;They have usurped powers of the county assemblies and now want to take up the roles of the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, police, Helb and the Credit Reference Bureau. We know these are the only agencies with powers to clear candidates in an election,&rdquo; the governor said last year.Oparanya has never appeared before the committee for both the 2013-14 and 2014-15 accounts, despite the Auditor General raising numerous audit queries.In March, recommendations in the audit query against Kakamega for 2013-14 were adopted. This means the officials accused of embezzling the county&rsquo;s funds will be held responsible, according to the legislators.The committee was to write a report recommending the DPP, DCI, and EACC take action.In today&rsquo;s meeting with the officials from the agencies, the committee is expected to handover the report to them.Some of the issues raised by the Auditor General were misappropriation and irregular diversion of county funds.The audit also pointed out the lack of documentation to support expenditure.The probe also revealed contraventions of the Public Procurement and Disposal Act.According to the auditor&rsquo;s report, there were no proper records of debtors and no evidence of efforts to recover some lost Sh10.2 million.
