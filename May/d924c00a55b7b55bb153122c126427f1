African countries have been urged to harmonise their quality standards for electric and technical systems to accelerate access to safe and sustainable power.During the ongoing Low Current Voltage Direct Current Conference on Sustainable Electricity Access last week, Energy PS Joseph Njoroge told delegates effective implementation and enforcement of policies and regulations, and adoption of international standards will enhance Africa&rsquo;s efforts to increase access to safe and sustainable power. &ldquo;As a country, we recognise the importance of international standards especially to such an important sector that touches on all facets of life, from health to agriculture,&rdquo; Njoroge said. LVDC is a disruptive technology that fundamentally changes and accelerates energy access by taking power generation increasingly towards renewable sources and away from fossil fuels. This is aimed at reducing the cost of energy generation to enhance accessibility. &ldquo;Our participation in International Electro-technical Commission Standards development demonstrates our commitment to adopt standards to facilitate trade, protect the environment and consumers,&rdquo; Njoroge said. The LVDC Conference on Sustainable Electricity Access held in Nairobi brought together stakeholders including policy makers, power utilities, equipment manufacturers and NGOs among others with the aim of supplying electricity to those without access, through disruptive technology. Speaking at the forum, Kenya Bureau of Standards managing director Charles Ongwae said the conference was important not only to Kenya and Africa at large, providing a platform in which stakeholders could share information on affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all.&ldquo;Kenya being the host country, aims to ensure that we provide standards based solutions that promote innovation, trade and quality life,&rdquo; Ongwae said. &ldquo;We continually work with the IEC and the industry in ensuring this goal is achieved through provision of standards and conformity assessment services in this sector.&rdquo;He said that KEBS had so far adopted over 1,200 IEC standards, some of which had been adopted in collaboration with the International Standards Organisation. Kenya Power data shows the country&rsquo;s energy mix dispatched has improved from 53 per cent hydro, 25 per cent thermal and 20 per cent geothermal in June 2013 to 41 per cent hydro, 13 per cent thermal and 40 per cent geothermal as at the end of December 2016.
