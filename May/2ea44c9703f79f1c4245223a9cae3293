Lamu woman representative Shakilla Abdalla wants the IEBC to postpone the August 8 General Elections on grounds that &ldquo;there are numerous errors on the voter&rsquo;s register&rdquo;.Speaking in Lamu on Friday, she said the 30-day period set for voters to confirm whether their names are in the voter&rsquo;s registers is too short.Abdalla said the exercise, which started two weeks ago, is proving to be unsuccessful because many voters cannot seem to trace their names in their respective voting centres, while others have their names misspelt.Shakilla said if the irregularities are not resolved on time, there are chances the forthcoming elections will not be free and fair.
