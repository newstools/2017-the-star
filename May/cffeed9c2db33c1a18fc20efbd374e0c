Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli has asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to take charge, lead by example and crack the whip on all corrupt officials in government.He blamed cartels in government and corruption for the soaring food prices and high cost of living.Atwoli asked why the government did not buy the maize produced last year and store it in reserves.&ldquo;All the maize was bought and sold outside [the country] that is why we are suffering now,&rdquo; he said.Atwoli was speaking during a meeting with floriculture shop stewards at Tom Mboya Labour College in Kisumu on Saturday.The importation of 29,990 tonnes of duty free maize continues to raise eyebrows.Various leaders have demanded the government come clean on the matter.&ldquo;President Uhuru must now take charge and deal with the cartels and government officials to arrest the situation currently being witnessed in the country,&rdquo; Atwoli said.He said Kenya has great agricultural potential but most farmers end up selling their produce at throwaway prices to dishonest businessmen.Atwoli urged Kenyans to vet leaders before electing them.
