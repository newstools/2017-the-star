NASA will expose the cartels behind the importation of the controversial maize from Mexico tomorrow, flagbearer Raila Odinga has said.He said the opposition knows the individuals and companies behind the maize scam and it wants to inform the public.The NASA principal said he has always been committed to zero tolerance on corruption, that even during the Grand Coalition government, he sacked William Ruto, the then minister for Agriculture, for allegedly being involved in a maize scandal.&ldquo;I sacked Ruto for messing up with the maize issue,&rdquo; he said, adding that his orders were reversed after President Mwai Kibaki reinstated Ruto.Raila spoke on Saturday in Rarieda during the burial of Gladys Onono Amollo, the mother of nominated Senator Elizabeth Ongoro.He was with ANC party leader Musalia Mudavadi, Senator James Orengo (Siaya), Governor Cornel Rasanga (Siaya), MPs Opiyo Wandayi (Ugunja) and Aduma Owuor (Nyakach).Others present were Bondo MP Gideon Ochanda (Bondo), nominated MP Oburu Oginga and Siaya woman representative Christine Ombaka.Raila dismissed President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s remarks that the skyrocketing maize prices and shortage dated back to 2011 during the Grand Coalition government.&ldquo;The price of maize in 2011 cannot affect the same in 2017. That is an absolute lie,&rdquo; the ODM leader said.He added that during his tenure as Prime Minister, the government imported maize following due process, but the imported maize that arrived in Kenya on May 12 was acquired in a fishy deal that puzzles the public.Raila said Uhuru should accept the reality that he has failed in his leadership and pave way for the NASA leadership, which will offer alternative solutions to jumpstart the economy.&ldquo;Uhuru should be prepared to exit from the presidency and let us show him how to govern since he has failed miserably,&rdquo; he said.Raila added that within 90 days of his election as President, Kenya will experience a positive economic transformation.He urged voters to out turn in large numbers on August 8, wisely elect leaders and send Jubilee home.Mudavadi said NASA will attend the Madaraka Day celebrations on June 1 in Nyeri as a show of solidarity with residents despite the current economic meltdown that every Kenyan is facing.The county leaders who attended the funeral said Raila&rsquo;s presidency will end poverty.Wandayi said tomorrow in the National Assembly he will name those behind the illegal maize importation.He added that some of those individuals are responsible for the fake fertilisers that were issued to farmers, leading to crop failure.
