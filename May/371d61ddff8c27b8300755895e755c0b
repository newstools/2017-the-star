Nurses have been been urged to be in the frontline of advocating patient safety, research, education and participation in shaping health policies. This will enable the country to achieve sustainable development goal number three of quality healthcare and wellbeing for all. This year&rsquo;s theme was &ldquo;Nurses: A voice to lead - achieving sustainable development goals.&rdquo;Susan Otieno, the President of the East, Central and Southern Africa College of Nursing, said, &ldquo;We need to have a voice in key healthcare policy-making organisations that influence service delivery at the local, national and international levels. We should advocate for representation in these organisations to enable us to speak out with authority.&rdquo;She spoke yesterday to a delegation of nurses during the International Nurses Day Celebrations held at the Aga Khan University Hospital. &ldquo;Nurses form the largest healthcare workforce in the world,&rdquo; Otieno said.
