Stanbic and NIC Bank have kicked off what is likely to be a "new normal" for banking industry, underpinned by reduced profitability. The industry is grappling with a growing rate of loan defaults which started in 2015, amid interest controls to protect borrowers from high loan charges and tight regulations to enhance sound corporate governance. Stanbic Bank on Friday became the second medium-sized lender to report a drop in net profit for three months through March 31, largely on rising bad debt and reduced interest earnings. Stanbic's profit after taxation slowed by 9.24 per cent to Sh1.08 billion from Sh1.19 billion it posted 12 months earlier. Net interest earnings contracted by 12.23 per cent to Sh2.44 billion, the country's eighth largest lender by market share said in a financial statement. The bank, however, advanced Sh11.81 billion, or 11.40 per cent, more loans to hit Sh115.37 billion in the first quarter of the year compared to the year before. Non-performing loans over the period jumped by nearly a third, rising 29.73 per cent to Sh5.76 billion resulting in a 32.80 per cent rise in provisions to Sh1.66 billion to cover for the defaults. Deposits rose by a fifth to Sh130.56 billion from Sh108.80 billion in March 2016. Stanbic joined NIC Group which on Thursday reported a 3.91 per cent drop in net profit in the January-March period to Sh952.04 million compared with the same period in 2016. NIC's loan book expanded by 3.87 per cent to Sh116.32 billion, while net net interest income rose 8.14 per cent to Sh2.71 billion. Customer deposits, on the other hand, increased 6.81 per cent to Sh117.84 billion. NIC is among the a growing list of lenders which have resorted to retrench staff amid heavy investment in digital retail banking channels to contain costs, and protect profit margins for the shareholders. NIC has reportedly send home 52 staff in a right-sizing move. Some of the other banks which have completed or in final stage of laying off employees include largest lender by deposit accounts Equity Group [400], StanChart [300], Family Bank [250], Sidian [108] and First Community [106]. Bank of Africa [which closed 12 branches in January], National Bank and Ecobank are some of the lenders which have not disclosed the number of employees they have retrenched. Largest lender by market share, KCB Group, on April 20 opened the exit door for employees who wish to retire early as it gears up for the next phase of layoffs. KCB&rsquo;s voluntary early retirement scheme, part of the ongoing implementation of its transformation strategy, targets to cut its Sh17.72 billion wage bill by about Sh2 billion every year. &ldquo;The programme is expected to align the competing needs of adapting to a banking industry whose outlook has been dimmed by legislative and regulatory reforms, and fast evolving technology platforms that are now attracting non-traditional players into the financial services sector,&rdquo; KCB said following decision by the board.
