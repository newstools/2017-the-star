Pathologists have said the three murdered childen of Kapsoya MCA aspirant James Ratemo were strangled to death before their bodies were thrown into River Nzoia.A postmortem on the bodies, led by Dr Keittany Kibet, revealed the children lacked air in the lungs, an indication they had been strangled. The children&rsquo;s bodies were recovered from the river last Friday.&ldquo;Our finding is they had a lot of bleeding around the neck, pointing towards strangulation. The challenge we had is the bodies had decomposed having not been preserved for more than three days,&rdquo; Kibet said.He said it was not possible to indicate if the killing was done by one or more people or if the children may have been drugged first before being killed. &ldquo;These were young people and it&rsquo;s possible that either one person or more may have been involved, although, from where I sit it&rsquo;s not possible to tell,&rdquo; Kibet said.He teamed up with three other pathologists to carry out the exercise at the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret in the presence of relatives, family members and their lawyer Charles Nyamweya.Clifford Nyamweya ( 7 ), Dan Nyamweya ( 5 ) and Glen Ongaki ( 3 ) were reported missing on May 13.Nyamweya said the children will be buried next week, but the family was yet to get an approval on its request to have the children buried at Ratemo&rsquo;s home within Eldoret town.&ldquo;We have requested for that exemption from Uasin Gishu county as required by law, but it&rsquo;s proving complicated. Though we are still pursuing the same,&rdquo; he said.There has been speculation about the murders were as a result of politics, a family feud and disputed land. &ldquo;We had planned to bury the children today (Friday), but considering the way things are, we will not do so until next week,&rdquo; Nyamweya told reporters at their home in Eldoret.He said public health experts had already surveyed the home in Eldoret town to establish if it was possible to bury the children at the home, but the county government was yet to give approval. Ratemo&rsquo;s home is in Kapsoya estate, and environment agency Nema will have to give its approval for the burial. He is vying on the Kanu ticket. Enock Onsase, the children&rsquo;s uncle who was suspected to have been the last person seen with the children, was not charged with murder after the prosecution asked for 10 days to complete investigations.
