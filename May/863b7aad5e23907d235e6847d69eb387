Garissa Governor Nathif Jama has urged unemployed youths to take advantage of the skills acquisition programmes offered by polytechnics.Jama made the call in Garissa when he handed out seven brick-making machines to be used to train youths in the seven subcounties.&ldquo;There has been a history of our boys, particularly the local ones, not being too keen on technical jobs or joining vocational training,&rdquo; he said yesterday.No county jobsJama said the county cannot employ all the youth, adding that white-collar jobs are limited.&ldquo;We are interested in reducing youths dependence on being employed. We would rather encourage them to embrace starting businesses in agriculture, carpentry or brick-making&rdquo;.He said formalisation of the informal sector is one of the approaches the county uses to end unemployment.The governor said the county alone cannot create the jobs needed.Jama urged parents to encourage their children to join polytechnics for training.30 youths targetTedThe programme targets a minimum of 30 youths in every subcounty.This will result in 210 trained brick makers at the end of the training.Should each of these 210 brickmakers use their skills and turn them into income-generating businesses, and if each will employ three people, then the programme will have the potential to create more than 800 jobs in the county.
