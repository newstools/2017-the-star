Losers who have failed to get favourable outcomes after appealing to their political parties have now moved to the judiciary&rsquo;s Political Party Disputes Tribunal. By Wednesday evening, 47 cases had been lodged. &ldquo;I have authorised the tribunal to sit beyond the normal working hours in order to dispense the appeals quickly,&rdquo; Chief Justice David Maraga said. &ldquo;The tribunal members have been sitting sometimes up to 8.30 in the night hearing cases.&rdquo;The tribunal has seven members, who sit three at a time.The CJ was speaking on Wednesday evening during the Annual Journalist of the Year Awards at the Hotel Intercontinental, where he was the chief guest. Applicants who will still not be satisfied with the outcome of the tribunal can appeal to the High Court, which is the final stage.Most of the political parties, including ODM and Jubilee will today finish hearing appeals.The judiciary expects that the number of cases filed at the tribunal will subsequently be about 100.The Registrar of Political Parties that has recently been dealing with thousands of nomination losers seeking to resign from the parties to run as independents, is also expected to wind up the applications today.By yesterday evening, there was still a huge crowd of politicians at the registrar&rsquo;s office in Lion Place, Westlands, seeking to be granted a divorce from the parties they were previously members of. Many of the aspirants said it would be unfair for the registrar to stop processing the resignations, as this would deny them the chance to run.Meanwhile, the CJ announced that the judiciary will next month begin electronic filing of cases in the Commercial Court. &ldquo;This will end cases of missing files,&rdquo; he said.The electronic filing system will initially run alongside the existent manual system, with the gradual phasing out of the manual system.The judiciary will next month release the report of the first performance contracting for its staff.CJ Maraga said the courts were prepared to handle the avalanche of cases expected after the August election.&ldquo;We have trained judges and magistrates on the new election laws and case management. We have also gazetted special magistrates to handle cases. All election petitions will also be complete within six months,&rdquo; he said.
