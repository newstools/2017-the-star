Opposition presidential candidate Raila Odinga yesterday launched another onslaught on Jubilee and accused the ruling party of riding on grand coalition ( 2008-12 ) administration projects.The NASA captain said President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s regime has failed to prescribe practical solutions to a myriad of problems that face Kenyans.He said, instead, Uhuru&rsquo;s administration has perfected the art of political treachery and taking credit for life-changing projects initiated by the Grand Coalition government in which he served as Prime Minister.Raila cited the standard gauge railway project from Mombasa to Nairobi as the brainchild of retired President Mwai Kibaki&rsquo;s regime.He said after Jubilee took power, the project was readvertised and the party ended up awarding the tender to the same company at an inflated cost."Jubilee has done nothing. They are just taking credit for the projects done by the Grand Coalition government," Raila said. He spoke when he met a delegation of Pokot professionals at Orange House. Raila accused Jubilee of neglecting and marginalising some communities.He formally received Pokot woman representative Regina Nyeris and Sigor MP Phillip Rotino, who joined ODM."I have the solution to the problems facing this country. Jubilee has perfected nepotism, not just tribalism," the opposition chief said."It is unfortunate that decades after Independence, Pokotos are ravaged by hunger and banditry."Raila said the government has reneged on its core mandate of providing security to Kenyans and instead abandoned the people of Pokot.
