Health workers in Murang&rsquo;a County Hospital risk being sacked for sending patients away on claims the county has not provided drugs.County Health chief officer Joseph Mbai said patients have complained of being forced to buy gloves, scalpels, cotton wool, scissors and drugs from private pharmacies.On Monday, a man who had taken his son to the hospital for a minor procedure almost broke down in tears after he was turned away.He was told he hospital lacked some supplies.SPENT HEALTH CASH ON fertiliser?The parent said the health workers told him Governor Mwangi Wairia had chosen to buy maize seed and fertiliser for farmers instead of equipping hospitals.&ldquo;They told me to go to a certain pharmacy in Murang&rsquo;a town to buy gloves, scissors and everything they would require to treat my son,&rdquo; the distraught father said.He did not have the money to buy the supplies and had to borrow Sh1,700 from a relative.Another resident who had gone to the hospital to collect insulin for her sick mother said it was not available on Monday.She said her mother has had diabetes for five years and has never missed her medication at the hospital.&ldquo;They said we voted for Governor Mwangi Wairia, which is why the hospital was without medication as he had used all the hospital&rsquo;s money on maize seed,&rdquo; the woman said.Some patients have complained nurses told them to take as medication the maize seed they were given by the county. They said they were told the hospital does not have drugs.Politicising medical servicesMbai said it is unfortunate that medical staff have chosen to engage in politics while on duty.&ldquo;It is unethical for a doctor or a nurse to fail to treat a patient who is in pain because of their political affiliations,&rdquo; Mbai said.He said he will write a circular to all hospitals and health centres, warning staffers to stop playing politics with patients&rsquo; lives or risk the sack.Last year, health workers went on strike over failure by the county to remit their statutory deductions.It is believed that delayed salaries have also put most health workers at loggerheads with the county government.Some have campaigned against the governor and continue to do so.
