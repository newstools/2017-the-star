Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko stole the show during yesterday&rsquo;s Labour Day celebrations in Uhuru Park, Nairobi.Every time a leader took to the podium, the crowd would chant Sonko&rsquo;s name. Vuvuzelas were blown when the Sonko Rescue Team passed in front of the podium.The team offers free services such as drilling boreholes, exhauster, construction, wedding and funeral services.Sonko received the loudest applause from the crowd, which chanted, &ldquo;Our governor, our governor&rsquo;&rsquo; .The flamboyant senator is eyeing the governor&rsquo;s seat held by Evans Kidero of ODM. This year&rsquo;s celebrations were led by Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli.The event brought together leaders from Malawi and Zimbabwe, and Kenyans from all walks of life.Government dignitaries who attended the celebrations included President Uhuru Kenyatta, Deputy President William Ruto, CSs Phyllis Kandie (Labour), Joseph Nkaissery (Interior) and Amina Mohamed (Foreign Affairs), Labour PS Susan Mochache and Kidero among others.Security was heightened with patrol cars stationed at strategic points in the park. Everyone entering the park was screened.Sonko, who donned a blue suit and purple shirt, urged Uhuru to look into the issues of low-income earners.He urged Uhuru to ensure that low-income earners are not taxed and the price of unga is reduced, as Kenyans are suffering.Immediately after he was done with his speech, a group of dancers hurriedly appeared on stage to introduce Atwoli.As they sang the song Ni nani atakae komboa Kenya, the crowd chanted &ldquo;Sonko, Sonko&rdquo;. But Atwoli said only the President can save Kenya.The crowd answered &ldquo;Sonko is the only leader that is not corrupt or tribalistic&rdquo;.
