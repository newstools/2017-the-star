The Kalenjin community has been urged to support Deputy President William Ruto for the presidency in 2022.Labour Party of Kenya&rsquo;s Ababu Namwamba said for Ruto to get time to seek votes from other communities in the country, he requires 100 per cent support from his community and others in the Rift Valley.Namwamba said the Kalenjin community should not take the Deputy President&rsquo;s position for granted.He spoke at Meibeki, Uasin Gishu, where he joined LPK Uasin Gishu Senate candidate Phillip Kiyeng who launched his bid on Saturday.Namwamba said, &ldquo;Do not be discouraged by a few people whose only interest is to derail and distract the DP from his ambition.&rdquo; He added, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give the DP a hard time at home that he has to defend himself.&rdquo; He asked the Kalenjin to stand firmly behind the DP by ensuring Ruto wins in 2022.&ldquo;Once President Uhuru Kenyatta and Ruto win the 2017 election, we should start charting the 2022 political direction.&rdquo; The Deputy President faces stiff competition from Kanu chairman Gideon Moi and Chama Cha Mashinani leader Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto, who has joined NASA.Namwamba, however, dismissed NASA, terming it a club of five old men who have little to offer the country.&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be misled by the five men who have formed a group that has no woman or youth representation.&rdquo; Namwamba said the five NASA principals have been in government before but did not effect any change.
