A 55-year-old man was on Friday jailed for life by a Naivasha court after he was found guilty of defiling his 13-year-old daughter.The former hotelier turned farmer shed tears following the ruling by Zainab Abdul - deputy registrar Naivasha High court.Peter Matheri Macharia had been charged that on June 12, 2016 at Maella village, he sexually abused his daughter.The accused, who was unrepresented, faced an alternative charge of indecently assaulting the minor by touching her private parts.In her testimony, the minor told the court how her father turned against her when the mother was away in hospital attending to a sick relative.The standard eight student said the father grabbed her by the mouth to block her screams before committing the act.In her ruling, the magistrate termed the offence as serious adding that the father, who was supposed to be the protector of the minor, had turned out to be a predator.Zainab dismissed the accused's defense that he had been framed. "A medical report adduced in the court had proven that the minor was defiled," she said.
