Kenyans and their authorities are suitably horrified by tragedies like the Manchester suicide bombing that killed more then 20 Britons, many of them teens and children, at a pop concert. Some of the most heartfelt messages on social media to Mancunians came from Kenyans in Kenya.Meanwhile, in the course of a week, more than a dozen Kenyans have died in IED blasts in Garissa and Mandera. A few weeks ago a single bus crash killed almost two-dozen Kenyans.But these homegrown terror and road carnage fatalities barely register a blip on social media. There is no outcry at al Shabaab&rsquo;s relentlessly evil handiwork and no outrage at killer PSV drivers who drive under the influence or are fatigued by sleep deprivation. There is no discussion about bribe-taking Traffic police who look the other way as the road carnage takes its deadly toll on Kenyans.Our national discourse on social media needs to turn to specifically Kenyan issues, including imponderables.Much more thought, time and resources ought to be expended by Kenyans on what ails Kenyans and what can be done to prevent it.
