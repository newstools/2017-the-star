A man has been charged with attempting to defraud Spire Bank, Nakuru branch, of more than Sh1.9 million. Mathew Kimani allegedly committed the offence on May 17 and 19. He was also charged withÂ stealing Sh700,000 from the bank on those dates. Police said Kimani is part of a cartel that hacks into the databases of banks and siphons money from their accounts. Three other suspects were arrested and arraigned in Nairobi, while another was arrested in Kisumu and is in custody as police investigate. Kimani pleaded not guilty to the charges and asked the court to grant him favourable bond terms. Chief magistrate Josephat Burudi granted him a surety bond of Sh600,000 with an alternative cash bail of Sh300,000. The case will be heard on July 31.
