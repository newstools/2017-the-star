Aspirants who lost in the primaries yesterday thronged the office of Registrar of Political Parties, seeking clearance to run as independent candidates.Malindi MP Willy Mtengo, Nyali parliamentary aspirant Mohamed Ali, alias Jicho Pevu, and Nakuru senator hopeful Koigi Wamwere were among the notable faces who were at Lucy Ndung&rsquo;u&rsquo;s office in Westlands.The aspirants claimed they were shortchanged during the primaries, adding that the process was not free and fair.&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t get fairness in the primaries. They were shambolic. They were ill-prepared. They were skewed towards my competitor,&rdquo; Mtengo said.The MP lost to current Kilifi woman representative Aisha Jumwa in the ODM primaries. Jumwa garnered 8,436 votes against Mtengo&rsquo;s 3,758.&ldquo;I tend to believe that I still have the will of the people and I want to say that this is a competitive game and may the people decide on August 8,&rdquo; he said.Aspirants seeking to run as independents must resign from their current parties.The registration letter must be submitted to the registrar who, up on receipt and approval, will strike off their names from the party register.The registrar will then issue them with a certificate showing they do not belong to any party.The certificate will then be submitted to the IEBC, which will clear them to run as independent candidates.Tomorrow is the deadline for the submission of the certificate to the polls agency.&ldquo;I will retain my seat, I will beat my opponent hands down. Nomination was a party affair and elections will be a government affair,&rdquo; Mtengo said.Muruka MCA hopeful in Murang&rsquo;a county, Joseph Ndung&rsquo;u, said the process was marred with irregularities and skewed in favour of the incumbent.&ldquo;I was in Jubilee, but there were irregularities because we arrested a woman with marked ballot papers in favour of the aspirant who won,&rdquo; he claimed.&ldquo;Then, many of my supporters were not allowed to vote because their names were not in the party register.&rdquo;Githurai 44 MCA aspirant Mwangi Waithera said, &ldquo;The process was not fair. Jubilee did not conduct primaries as it promised.&rdquo; &ldquo;There were few clerks, security was not enough and the process started late and in some areas, people voted more than once.&rdquo;
