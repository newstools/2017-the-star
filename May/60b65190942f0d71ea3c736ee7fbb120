Deputy President William Ruto met with some of his allies and aides to resolve a growing row and potential fallout between them over the Jubilee Party primaries in the Rift Valley.Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago, Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi and some of those who won the JP primaries in the North Rift attended the private meeting in Nairobi on Friday.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true we met the DP briefly and all he told us is that he wants peace in Eldoret and that he does not want to hear about tribal politics in the region,&rdquo; an MP, who declined to be named, said.Mandago and Sudi declined to comment on the details of the meeting.The two, along with Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter, had accused Ruto&rsquo;s aides Farouk Kibet and Reuben Maiyo of plotting to interfere with the JP primaries in favour of some aspirants.The two have denied any such plans.Sources said Farouk and Maiyo were at the meeting. The meeting took place as State House political adviser Joshua Kuttuny said Ruto had handled the Jubilee primaries well and should not be blamed by losers.Smooth primariesIn a statement, he said the decision by President Uhuru Kenyatta to have Ruto take charge of the primaries was well-thought-out and the nominations have strengthened the party.There is no split among close allies and aides of the DP over alleged fall-outs resulting from the primaries, Kuttuny said.&ldquo;The DP did very well and it&rsquo;s clear that he did not favour anyone during the primaries. Those of us in Jubilee within Rift Valley and other regions are united behind the President and his deputy,&rdquo; he said.Kuttuny won the JP primaries for Cherangany MP.He said the polls were run smoothly in most parts of Kenya and he attributed the success to Ruto being in charge.Last week, reports emerged of a new political alliance in the North Rift led by Mandago that includes Keter, Sudi and Kuttuny.Sudi was quoted saying the new group includes leaders with the genuine interests of the Kalenjin community at heart. He said the group will still support the DP and even ensure he wins the presidential polls in 2022.No splinter group, we back DP RutoRuto&rsquo;s aides opposed the formation of the new group and accused it of interfering with JP primaries to favour some aspirants.But Kuttuny said, &ldquo;We have no splinter group as claimed. We are all united in working for the good of Kenyans. In particular we all want President Kenyatta and his deputy reelected.&rdquo;He added that Ruto&rsquo;s aides did not play any political role during the primaries.Kuttuny urged all leaders to focus on unity regardless of their tribe or political affiliation.&ldquo;The talk of splinter groups among DP Ruto allies is not only imaginary but meant to create differences among leaders from the North Rift region. But we will remain united,&rdquo; he said.Kuttuny thanked Cherangany residents for nominating him to fly the JP flag on August 8.He said he will unite all communities in the cosmopolitan constituency.
