Independent candidates stand no chance of securing seats in ODM strongholds, Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi has said. Wandayi accused politicians who lost in the party's primaries of thwarting leader Raila Odinga's presidential bid. "Those who call themselves independent candidates have no space in Nyanza or any ODM stronghold," he told the Star in a phone interview on Thursday. "They [should] reduce congestion by saving their campaign resources for 2022." The MP further said such candidates have betrayed ODM and asked voters to punish them by voting them out. Wandayi said ODM candidates are expected to launch a spirited campaign to sweep all the six positions that will be on the ballot in the August 8 polls. His remarks came after a section of politicians from Nyanza region opted to vie as independent candidates after losing in the chaotic ODM primaries. In Siaya, Nicholas Gumbo is set to run against incumbent Governor Cornel Rasanga. Gumbo said he is confident he will trounce Rasanga in the general election. He claimed he garnered 127,000 votes against Rasanga’s
70,000. Paul Otuoma made the same decision after losing to Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong. Kisumu Governor Jack Ranguma may also run independently against Senator Anyang' Nyong'o. Ranguma accused the ODM election board of imposing a candidate on residents and of denying him victory. He claimed Nyong’o conspired with ODM top leadership to rig him
out in the nominations. Ranguma is yet to concede defeat to Nyong’o. In Migori, Ochillo Ayacko hinted at going independent after losing the ODM ticket to incumbent Okoth Obado.
