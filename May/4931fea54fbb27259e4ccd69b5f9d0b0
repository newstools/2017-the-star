THE storm over nominees to the the East African Legislative Assembly is not about to die just yet. Sources whisper to Corridors that this is not the first time Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka is getting a relative into a high profile job. After the 2013 polls, Kalonzo is said to have nominated his sister-in-law, a Mrs Jane Muasya, to the Nairobi County Assembly, elbowing aside one Jane Kotut, who was the first Wiper nominee in the IEBC list. The sister-in-law, said to be the Wiper deputy director of elections, was part of the vetting panel that approved Kennedy Musyoka, her nephew, to be the party's EALA nominee this year. A senior Wiper MP was heard saying that on this latest move on EALA, Kalonzo had goofed big time. He gave the example of ODM that has nominated a Maasai, a Kalenjin and a coastal. Talk about the Face of Kenya Factor!*****
