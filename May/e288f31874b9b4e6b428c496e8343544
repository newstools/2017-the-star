The IEBC yesterday told senators it may clear aspirants charged with an offence to contest in the August polls if they provide proof of an appeal or review of their cases.The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission CEO, Ezra Chiloba, said they will also consider recommendations made by Parliament against some candidates. They include former Devolution CS Anne Waiguru and Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya.Chiloba said Parliament is a competent oversight institution and that recommendations in its committee reports cannot be ignored in holding individuals to account.He said Parliament and other constitutional institutions raising questions on aspirants&rsquo; integrity should present evidence the IEBC can consider before clearance starts on Sunday.&ldquo;As long as the commission is presented with evidence we shall make the decision to disqualify all such candidates,&rdquo; Chiloba said.The National Assembly on Tuesday adopted a report by the Public Accounts Committee chaired by Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo recommending former CS Anne Waiguru be barred from holding public office over the Sh1.8 billion National Youth Service scandal.Senate Public Accounts and Investments Committee chaired by Kisumu Senator Anyang Nyong&rsquo;o wants Oparanya barred from contesting. He is accused of defying summonses to respond to audit queries on the county&rsquo;s expenditure since he took office in 2013.The two could be barred from contesting unless they seek a review or appeal the decisions the Senate committee and National Assembly have made.Chiloba said the commission will not entertain any rumours or unsubstantiated evidence submitted by an institution to disqualify any candidate.
