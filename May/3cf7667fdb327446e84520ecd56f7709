Jubilee&rsquo;s pointman Suleiman Shahbal has told Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho his claims that a dry port in Naivasha will weaken Coast economy are self-serving. Suleiman said dry port is a Container Freight Station in which Joho&rsquo;s family own several. &ldquo;This is his business. How has it benefited residents of Mombasa?&rdquo; he said. Shahbal spoke on Saturday when he met opinion leaders at Coast Girls High School. Joho, through his aide Richard Chacha, said he will not respond to Shahbal&rsquo;s accusations. The governor said economy will be hurt, jobs lost and a wave of crime will take over. Joho says the move is a wider scheme by Jubilee to undermine his region perceived to be opposition&rsquo;s stronghold. There has been a bitter fight between Joho and the national government over the creation of a dry port in Naivasha.
