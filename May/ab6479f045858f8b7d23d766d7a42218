Dr Ofweneke&rsquo;s ex-fianc&eacute;e and baby mama Nicah has revealed if the top comedian still supports his daughter after their nasty breakup in 2016. &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; replied Nicah when I asked whether Ofweneke sent her any Mother&rsquo;s Day message on Sunday.The single mother of two also revealed how she&rsquo;s managing with finances. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not hard, God has been providing for us. Apart from music, I have my businesses that I&rsquo;m doing, you know you can&rsquo;t depend on music.&rdquo;When asked if Ofweneke supports his daughter, she giggled and said: &ldquo;Let me not answer that. Can&rsquo;t talk about it. But just know that I&rsquo;m the one paying the bills, I think that&rsquo;s enough.&rdquo;
