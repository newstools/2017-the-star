Everyone has danced to the RnB star's single Distance. Now, Nairobi will have the chance to see Omarion perform the song live on stage at the Afro Pop Festival at Ngong Racecourse on June 3.Omarion, known for tracks including Ice Box, Post to Be and BDY On Me, said he is excited to perform in Nairobi.&ldquo;Distance truly represents me arriving as an artiste and as a creator. I&rsquo;ve been more involved with everything, from the concept to the editing. Distance is the re-emergence of me as a director, fashion icon, performer, and entertainer who speaks multiple creative languages,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Lyrically, it&rsquo;s about recreating a connection that I feel like is missing from the game. Songs used to bring people together. Nowadays we&rsquo;re in the club and everyone is on their phones. Stay connected. Let&rsquo;s dance.&rdquo;As one of the youngest veterans in the industry, Omarion has enriched the music landscape as a chart-topping, multi-platinum Grammy Award-nominated singer, producer and actor for over two decades. &ldquo;After all of this time, everything makes sense. I&rsquo;ve matured as a man and evolved as an artist. This is the new level, the new wave, the new sound. This is the new Omarion,&rdquo; he said. The American singer, songwriter, rapper actor, and dancer was the lead singer of the American R&amp;B boy band B2K. The group achieved success with singles like Bump, Bump, Bump, which reached number-one on the Billboard Hot 100.
