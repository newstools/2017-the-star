Three Jubilee MPs from Western have said NASA is not a threat to JP in the region.Ikolomani MP Bernard Shinali (pictured) and his Malala counterpart Moses Malulu said NASA stopped being a threat the moment ODM leader Raila Odinga was named the flagbearer.&ldquo;We were all waiting for Mudavadi to be named the torchbearer to cross and back him, but the return of the 2013 opposition ticket at Uhuru Park deflated the excitement that was in the region,&rdquo; Malulu said.Shinali said Luhya leaders expected the power-sharing deal to be realistic, but it turned out the NASA co-principals were promised positions that do not exist.Mumias East MP Ben Washiali, the JP pointman in Kakamega, yesterday said there is uncertainty over the positions slotted for Luhyas in NASA.
