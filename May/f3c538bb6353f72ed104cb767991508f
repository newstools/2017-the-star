The middle class and professionals should engage in politics if they want change. They usually take a back seat and afterwards complain about everything that happens in the country, Mombasa governor nominee Hassan Omar (Wiper) has said.&ldquo;I do not know why in Kenya, professionals and the middle class do not engage in politics, but complain about everything and anything,&rdquo; the Mombasa senator said on Wednesday.&ldquo;In the comfort of your sitting rooms, you are angry about everyone and everything, but do nothing about it. Your politics extends and ends in your living rooms.&rdquo;He spoke to accountants at Whitesands Hotel during the annual conference of the Institute of Certified Public Accountants.Most MCAs are not professional and there is always a challenge in running the county government, Omar said.&ldquo;Professional are literally lethargic in issues of politics. But when I become governor, I will have to appoint 10 professionals to manage the county,&rdquo; he said.Professionals might not be the remedy to the myriad problems counties face, but they can bring change, the Wiper secretary general said.&ldquo;In Mombasa, I have been able to lure people to get into politics. We now have a litany of people seeking elective posts, who are professional. We need to break those barriers and misconceptions that professionals cannot engage in politics,&rdquo; he said.Other leaders in the race are incumbent Hassan Joho (ODM), Suleiman Shahbal (Jubilee) and Hezron Awiti (Vibrant Democratic Party).
