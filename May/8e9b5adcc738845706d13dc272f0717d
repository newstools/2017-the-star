Wiper leaders yesterday told off Jubilee over the closure of Kalonzo Musyoka Foundation, terming it a plan to intimidate the NASA principal.Deputy party leader and Lamu woman representative Shakilla Abdalla told Jubilee to stop frustrating Kalonzo for being in NASA and instead wait for a major defeat on August 8. Addressing a press conference in Malindi with Wiper aspirants from Kilifi county, she said some forces within the government are trying to fight Kalonzo.Abdalla said the suspension of the foundation&rsquo;s accounts is a clear indication NASA leaders are being targeted. She said Jubilee first froze the accounts of Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho before turning the heat on Kalonzo. &ldquo;Why are they doing it selectively? Kalonzo then Joho. We do not know who is next,&rsquo;&rsquo; she said.
