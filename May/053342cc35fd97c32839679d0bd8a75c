Lecturers and students at Great Lakes University, Kisumu, have thrown their weight behind vice chancellor Atieno Amadi (pictured). The university assistant registrar academics Samson Obonyo said leadership wrangles in the recent months have slowed down learning at the institution.Obonyo said they have faith in their VC and criticised individuals trying to impose another VC. Students&rsquo; union president John Maramba said they will not allow their VC to be intimidated by a few individuals who are keen on running down the institution.Union secretary general Alloyce Odero said there is a calculated move to instil fear in students, so that they leave the school. Amadi was briefly replaced by David Kodia in March before moving to court to stop her suspension. Speaking yesterday, Amadi said certain forces are fighting back after she rolled out strict rules at the institution.
