Free HIV testing kits to screen close to 400,000 Kenyans who do not know their HIV status will be rolled out in July. The move puts Kenya in the global map once again as it will be the first country to introduce the kits to the market. They will cost about Sh800 if bought over the counter. Studies done on self-testing kit have shown the results are 80 per cent effective. "Once you take the test at home ensure you go to a health facility to confirm your result," Martin Sirengo, Head of NASCOP, said. HIV self-testing (HIVST) refers to a process in which a person collects his or her own specimen (oral fluid or blood) and then performs an HIV test and interprets the result. "It should be done in a private setting, either alone or with someone he or she trusts." "The primary goal of the HIV self-testing is to complement other existing other HIV testing approaches," Rudolf Eggers, WHO representative to Kenya, said. Close to 1.5 million people are living with HIV in Kenya out of which nearly one million are on life-long treatment. The self-testing kits come in the wake of introduction of Prep (pre â€“ exposure prophylaxis) which involves taking the drug orally daily. The drug would cost about Sh600 per month and Sh6,000 annually in private health facilities. Prep is said to be 96 per cent effective in reducing new HIV infections. It is supposed to be taken by people who are at a higher risk of contracting HIV especially discordant couples. Others eligible for the treatment are individuals who do not use condoms and those who frequently contract STIs. People with multiple sexual partners, drug users and people who frequently use post-exposure prophylaxis qualify for the drug. Kenya is the second country in Africa, after South Africa, to rollout Prep. Prep users are advised to practice safe sex. Read: Anti-HIV pill saved my marriage: New drug cuts infection risk by 96%
