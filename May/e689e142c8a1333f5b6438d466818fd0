I do not regret clashing with President Uhuru Kenyatta publicly in March this year, Turkana Governor Josphat Nanok has said.Nanok said he is determined to fight for his people to ensure they get their rightful share of oil money. He spoke during a meet-the-people tour in the county on Wednesday. The county boss said he will push to have 30 per cent of oil revenues go to his residents, and not five per cent proposed by the national government.&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter who is more powerful, but I will continue to defend Turkana&rsquo;s right to have a fair share of oil proceeds. The county and the national governments must work together and ensure the local communities benefit. This will remain my main agenda,&rdquo; Nanok said.He said his development record speaks for itself, and he is confident he will trounce his Jubilee rival Senator John Munyes in the August 8 election. Nanok is running on the ODM ticket.Uhuru had visited Turkana, but he was agitated by Nanok when he said the national government should allow residents get their rightful share.&ldquo;If you do that, then we will be ready to listen to you,&rdquo; Nanok told the president who was with Deputy President William Ruto. Uhuru told off Nanok, warning him that he will not allow anyone to dictate to him on what to do.
