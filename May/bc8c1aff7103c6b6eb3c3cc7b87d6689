Residents of Katsakakairu village in Lamu West subcounty yesterday boycotted the handover of a Sh5 million dispensary built by the county government.Governor Issa Timamy found an empty ground after two chiefs and the contractor mobilised youths to boycott the event over nonpayment. The chiefs had allegedly also attempted to convince residents of Moa village to boycott another handover, but failed.They said the dispensary would benefit of them and would not allow anyone to mislead them. The Katsakakairu residents sat at a corner and watched Timamy. The contractor had earlier locked the doors of the facility and painted on the walls, &ldquo;Iko deni hakuna kufungua&rdquo; (We won&rsquo;t open the facility because you have a debt).GSU officers from the Nyongoro outpost, regular and administration police were on standby to ensure there were no chaos. Timamy proceeded to open the facility and blamed senior government officials for the boycott. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame they play cheap politics,&rdquo; he said.
