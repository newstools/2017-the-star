There is a multipurpose social hall that has been under construction in Nairobi&rsquo;s Jerusalem estate for almost seven years now. Several contractors have been brought to the site, but they abandon the work in unclear circumstances. With the onset of rains, part of the wall has started falling apart. The site is now a disaster in waiting, especially to children. Residents of the estate are asking Governor Evans Kidero (pictured)to either order for the building to be completed or be brought down.***** A two-term MP who recently won a corruption case is a proud man. The MP, known for his fiery criticism of the government, is at it again, firing one salvo after another aimed at sending a clear message to the ruling Jubilee Party that he cannot be intimidated anymore. The MP was overheard freely expressing his mind in Parliament that the gag which prevented him from criticising the government with such zeal had been removed. &ldquo;I am back and I want to send a message to Jubilee that they will not succeed in harassing me, after all I am a free man and I don&rsquo;t need to kneel before the powers that be&rdquo;, the lawmaker was heard saying.***** THAT politicians are often ridiculous is not in doubt and with the electioneering period here with us, more shocks from follyticians await Kenyans. Political parties nominations starting from the EALA offer Kenyans food for thought. For, instance, as nominees to the EALA sparked outrage after politicians picked their relatives and cronies, one thing stood out: Some ladies picked for the positions were described by a politician as &lsquo;so beautiful&rsquo; they would give the regional Parliament an opportunity to sample Kenya&rsquo;s &lsquo;finest&rsquo;. This no-brainer process has made millions of Kenyans groan.***** A Member of Parliament who wants to be governor in a county in Nyanza is not sitting pretty as Election Day draws ever nearer. The lawmaker is said to be recruiting goons to take on his opponent, the incumbent said to have also hired six-pack bouncers ahead of the polls. The legislator is spending a lot of resources in offering himself protection, fearing for his life after the incumbent reportedly threatened him during a public rally. Is this youth employment or exploitation?***** A female MP with loose morals may after all not offer any role model lessons to young women dreaming to take up a political career. The female lawmaker was earlier this year spotted with a Principal Secretary in a compromising position at a high-end hotel. She was last week literally pleading with the love of her heart within the corridors of Parliament after the man reportedly went on a go-slow after hearing the rumours.
