We do not wish to die before we get our dues, the more than 50,000 teachers who retired between 1997 and 2006 have told President Uhuru Kenyatta.In a petition, the retirees say Uhuru needs to step in and address their concerns. They say they lead a destitute life after serving the country diligently for years.&ldquo;To date, there is no transparent programme and list of who will be paid what and when. Lack of the list creates room for corruption and exploitation,&rdquo; part of the petition reads.The petition has been signed by Geoffrey Mwirikia (chairperson), Simon Ndung&rsquo;u (secretary), John Njung&rsquo;e (coordinator) Gathoga Ngure (coordinator), Martin Gichure (assistant secretary) and Esther Ngene (treasurer). &ldquo;Due to our age, health and poor financial status, we request quick payment of salary arrears based on when we retired to the final phase, pension and pension arrears as calculated according to the difference of what we received at retirement and what we were entitled to.&rdquo;The retirees told the President they &ldquo;have high hopes&rdquo; they will soon be granted their request.&ldquo;Ours has been there for 20 years to date. We plead with you to come to our rescue.&rdquo; On May 5 last year, Treasury CS Henry Rotich said 21,000 teachers who retired in 1997 will not get their share of a Sh16.7 billion pension arrears payout as their records cannot be verified. Rotich told MPs the government had set aside Sh3 billion to pay 31,000 teachers out of the 52,000 who were awarded Sh42 billion by the High Court. At least Sh1.5 billion was included in the supplementary budget, while another Sh1.5 million was to be paid in the 2016-17 national Budget after a protracted 18 years of court battles.Rotich, who appeared before the House Resolutions Implementation Committee, said the excess teachers could not be found in government records, raising concerns they could be ghost workers in a wider scheme to defraud the taxpayer.National Assembly Education Committee chairperson Sabina Chege told the Star yesterday that payments are ongoing. Teachers Service Commission boss Nancy Macharia could not be reached for comment.
