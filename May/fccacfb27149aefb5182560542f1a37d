Former NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga&rsquo;s aide, Eliud Owalo, yesterday criticised his former boss over his latest comments on independent candidates.Raila on Sunday, during a church service at ACK St Stephens Cathedral in Kisumu, disowned the independent candidates. He said they have never promised to campaign for them.Raila rallied supporters to reject independents at the ballot, saying ODM needed numbers in both Houses of Parliament. &ldquo;Independent candidates are largely an outcome of shambolic nominations on one hand and hand-picking of candidates for various positions by leaders of the existing political parties on the other,&rdquo; said Owalo. Some 4,500 candidates have been cleared by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to vie as independents.
