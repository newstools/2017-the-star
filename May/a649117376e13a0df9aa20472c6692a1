A Kilifi-based international NGO has urged the county government to involve residents in drafting the budget. &ldquo;The budget is for the people and public participation should not be a formality and a form of communication between citizens and the government. It is sad most of their views are ignored,&rdquo; said Alex Yator, an officer at International Committee For the Development of People. He was speaking in a Watamu hotel on Friday during a workshop on budget-making.Kilifi North subcounty administrator Mwenda Karisa said the public can be involved fully in the process by passing legislations. &ldquo;The law should create the office of the budget officer and funds allocated specifically for the exercise,&rdquo; he said. The finance department oversees the exercise every year. &ldquo;Everyone in the department must be involved,&rdquo; Magarini subcounty administrator Silas Ngundo said.
