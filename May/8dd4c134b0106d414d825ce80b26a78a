Deputy President William Ruto has told Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto to stop misleading the Kipsigis community on the Mau issue. He accused the county boss of visiting Mau areas and telling residents that the government has been insensitive to their plight. Ruto said the government has tried to ensure the caveat imposed on title deeds is lifted. He spoke on Sunday during an interdenominational prayer service in Nkaroni Primary School, Narok county. Ruto was accompanied by Narok Governor Samuel Tunai, National Assembly Deputy Speaker Joyce Laboso, Senators Kipchumba Murkomen (Elgeyo Marakwet), Aaron Cheruiyot (Kericho), Beatrice Elachi (nominated), MPs Korei ole Lemein (Narok South), Soipan Kudate (Narok), Environment PS Charles Sunkuli and Health PS Julius Korir. He criticised Rutto for maligning him, saying the governor has opposed every development project by the Jubilee administration.
