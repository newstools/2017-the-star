There seems to be confusion on the available maize stock in the country with the food status reports indicating 6.4 million bags, while Agriculture PS Richard Lesiyampe last week said Kenya had 980,000 bags.According to the April food and crop situation report, the current estimated maize stock stands at 6.4 million bags.&ldquo;Out of this stock, millers and traders are collectively holding about 1.2 million bags and the National Cereals and Produce Board holding 590,000 million bags,&rdquo; the report states.Last week, Lesiyampe told the parliamentary Agriculture Committee that the current maize stock is at 980,000 bags, which is expected to last until the end of the month.He added that between now and end of July the government will have imported five million bags of maize to supplement the harvest from the South Rift, lower Nyanza and Western.The report indicates that despite the early crop harvest from some parts of the country, especially in the South Rift, and lower parts of Nyanza and Western, there will be a deficit of 3.5 million bags in August.&ldquo;The maize balance sheet forecast to August 2017 shows if modest imports from neighbouring countries stand at about 500,000 bags in the forecast period, and despite some early harvest in lower parts of Nyanza and Western region, there will be a shortfall of 3,321,744 bags,&rdquo; the food report says.The shortfall of maize will be due to the poor crop performance in most parts of the country, which received near normal rains, and also the control and management of the armyworm that has since destroyed the crop in Kitale, Eldoret, Kakamega, Kericho, Kisii and Nandi. These areas are considered Kenya&rsquo;s food basket.The stocks of beans in April were at 637,331 bags mainly held by farmers and traders during the period under review. Wheat stocks available comprise mainly imported wheat held by millers and traders at 2.7 million bags. It is estimated that at the end of August, Kenya will have a surplus of beans and wheat of 84,049 and 7.6 million bags, respectively.The average prices of maize and beans in April 2017 increased by 16.7 and 13.1 per cent, respectively, while the price of Irish potatoes increased by one per cent compared to March 2017.Due to scarcity in the local market, the prices of maize flour had hit a high of between Sh150 and Sh180 for a 2kg packet.The government has subsidised some brands and they now cost Sh90 for a 2kg packet of unga.
