The government has warned politicians against engaging secondary school students in political activities ahead of the August 8 General Election.Lari deputy county commissioner Aaron Koros said some politicians are approaching day students with IDs and are registered voters.&ldquo;The only students with IDs and voter&rsquo;s cards are a few form fours and maybe several in form three,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;These are students whose teachers and parents are working so hard to ensure they pass examinations. You must not enter schools because your presence disorganises learning since other students would also like to see you.&rdquo; He spoke yesterday at Equity Bank, Kimende branch, where he flagged off Peace Committee match to his office. Koros was with assistant county commissioner Carol Chepkemoi, chiefs and peace committee.
