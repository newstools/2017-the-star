Kiambu county Jubilee Party nominees have told independent candidates to support President Uhuru Kenyatta.However, they warned them to keep clear of JP affairs because they are no longer party members when they left to run as independents.The nominees gathered at Githunguri Stadium on Saturday during a thanksgiving ceremony presided over by Rev David Gakuyo Ngari. The nominees said they will beat the independents hands down as was the case during the nominations.Governor nominee Ferdinand Waititu said the nominees have no problem with their competitors, &ldquo;only that they should respect our party and it&rsquo;s nominees as well as stop issuing ultimatums and conditions to Uhuru&rdquo;.Addressing scores of supporters, the Kabete MP said it is ill-advised for independent candidates to allude that there would be voter apathy in Jubilee strongholds if they are not endorsed by UhuRuto. Waititu said the independents should know there is a clear distinction between their supporters and those of Uhuru and Ruto. &ldquo;I hear they are saying that people will not turn out to vote for Uhuru if they are not on the ballot. I wonder whether they have put voters in their pockets to control them,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They should not intimidate the President because he is our team leader and we the people of Mt Kenya are solidly behind him.&rdquo;Waititu floored Kiambu Governor William Kabogo during the nomination, but Kabogo contested the results. He has since declared he will defend his seat as an independent candidate. The governor says the elections were rigged. Waititu dismissed the so-called Third Force as a group of spent forces who were finding it hard to accept they were defeated by those they perceived to be political novices. Kiambu Senator Kimani Wamatangi said he is ready to work with his fellow nominees and urged residents to ignore the independent candidates. during the elections
