Two Jubilee Budalang’i MP aspirants claim the party issued them certificates. Mediatrice Wangira, who was declared the winner during the party nominations and issued a certificate, celebrated her victory on Saturday under heavy security to avoid possible confrontation with her rival’s supporters. Her opponent, Alfred Maloba, who claimed to have been issued a certificate by the National Elections Board, also toured the constituency’s four wards, thanking residents for supporting him. At one point, Maloba’s supporters stopped at the gate of their opponent and began hurling insults, but were forced to flee when Wangira’s supporters threatened to beat them. Speaking to the Star at Ruambwa Junction during her meet-the people tour, Wangira said she won the nomination “in broad daylight” and was issued the nomination certificate. She said her opponent got a parallel nomination certificate through the back door. “My opponent has refused to accept defeat, yet I floored him in the nominations by a landslide. I am not worried at all, because the certificate I have is legal and fully recognised by the party,” Wangira said.
