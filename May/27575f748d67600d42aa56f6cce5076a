Garissa woman representative Shukran Gure has told her opponents to brace themselves for a tough battle in August, saying she is firmly in the race.Speaking yesterday to the press at the Garissa Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission offices after presenting her nomination papers, Gure said she is confident of being reelected. She dispelled rumours that she had dropped her bid.&ldquo;Presenting my papers and being cleared by the electoral body is a clear indication of my resolve to win back my seat. So the malicious people who have been spreading all manner of rumours should look for something else to talk about,&rdquo; Gure said.Early this month, a fake Facebook post saying she is &lsquo;quitting politics&rsquo; went viral. In the post, she apologised to her supporters for her decision to drop out of the race, and that she had secured a visa to go back to &lsquo;her country of origin&rsquo; &ndash; the USA. She denied authoring it. Gure said no amount of rumour mongering and negative publicity will deter her. She said she has matured politically since she was elected in 2013, and will beat her opponents. Some residents say she has done nothing for them. But Gure said she has empowered women and youths through the Affirmative Action Fund.&ldquo;My opponents can say whatever they want, but I would want to know the barometer they use to measure my success,&rdquo; Gure said. She is running against Fatuma Kinsi of ODM, Ebla Sahal (Ford-K), Amina Subow (JP], Mariam Sheikh (Third Way Alliance) and Amina Kenyan of Kanu.
