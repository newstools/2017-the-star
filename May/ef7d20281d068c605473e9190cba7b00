The Political Parties Disputes Tribunal on Tuesday dismissed a petition by Limuru MP John Kiragu challenging the nomination of former MP Peter Mwathi as the JP candidate.Justice Kyalo Mbobu said the primaries were not marred by irregularities, as alleged, and ordered Mwathi be handed the nomination certificate.Mwathi won with 19,977 votes against the incumbent&rsquo;s 14,790.George Maara came in third with 8,403 votes.Maara has since ditched Jubilee and will run as an independent on August 8.Kiragu had first appealed at the Jubilee Party&rsquo;s tribunal, saying the polls were unfair.His complaint was dismissed and he turned to the PPDT at the Milimani law courts.Speaking at Milimani afterward, Mwathi described the petition as part of the challenges he will face in the run-up to the polls.But he said he will weather the storm because his supporters are sending him messages of goodwill.He urged supporters of other JP aspirants to rally behind him.Mwathi asked residents not to vote for candidates in other parties, because they are likely to shoot down Jubilee motions in the National Assembly.He assured them JP lawmakers will give President Uhuru Kenyatta full support in Parliament. &ldquo;You can imagine a situation where you elected an MP on another party or an independent candidate who had promised he or she would support President Uhuru.&ldquo;Later, you hear them saying that they were not consulted on a particular motion by the government,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;We need someone who is answerable to the President&rsquo;s party, residents and to the President himself.&rdquo;Mwathi urged supporters, who had accompanied him to the court and those of the incumbent, to pray for peaceful campaigns election.&ldquo;Let us pray for each other, our President and our country at large.&ldquo;We wouldn&rsquo;t want to see violence like the mayhem we witnessed years ago. We all need this country today and in days to come,&rdquo; he said.Mwathi said he won because of his initiatives to improve primary and secondary education in his area.He launched a vocational college that offers free courses in hair dressing, secretarial work and driving.&ldquo;Over 300 students graduate each year. And the institute, Mwathi Foundation, will continue,&rdquo; he said.
