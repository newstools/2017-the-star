In September 2015, the High Court found some clauses of sections 295 to 297 of the Penal Code unconstitutional for failing to clearly define the offences of robbery, robbery with violence and attempted robbery with violence.These sections prescribe mandatory sentence for five capital offences: murder, treason, oathing for criminal activities by proscribed criminal outfits, robbery and attempted robbery with violence. A three-judge bench comprising of Justices Jessie Lesiit [presiding], Luka Kimaru and Stella Mutuku recommended that the Attorney General, the Kenya Law Reform and other relevant agencies prepare a detailed professional review to enable Parliament to appropriately amend the provisions.The judges said the sections do not meet the constitutional threshold of setting out in sufficient precision, distinctively clarifying and differentiating the degrees of aggravation of the offence of robbery and attempted robbery with particularities to enable the accused to adequately answer to the charges and prepare their defences. They recommended the amendments to remove the ambiguities and inconsistencies inherent in the definition of the offences of robbery and differentiate and graduate the degrees of aggravation and the attendant penalties, especially on the mandatory death sentence.The ambiguities in the Penal Code could have made convicts who did not necessarily need to hang face the hangman.MATCH CHARGES WITH FACTSThe judges want the Parliament to consider and adopt international best practices on sentencing &ldquo;so as to accord similar facts to similar charges of equal gravity&rdquo;.The AG and Parliament were given 18 months to comply with the order. Failure to comply may give more than 4,000 capital offenders a window to sue the state for unconstitutional incarceration.But AG Githu Muigai said he moved to the Supreme Court to seek advice on how to comply with the order.&ldquo;We have decided not to take action until the Supreme Court gives direction that would help us achieve this with minimum litigation later on. We have been before the court earlier this year, we had a very long hearing on the constitutionality of mandatory death sentences,&rdquo; Muigai said.&ldquo;We are expecting the judgment this month or very early next month. My own understanding is that this particular judgment would result in very wide-ranging reforms on the criminal law around mandatory sentences in general, but the death sentence in particular.&rdquo;High Court criminal division principal judge Justice Jessie Lesiit told the Star the review would allow Parliament to provide guidelines on how to arrive at death sentence.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t consider things like age of the person and whether it was a first offence or not. Because this death sentence is automatic, the court cannot consider how old this man was when he committed this offence or how many times had he committed it,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;Because these seem to be irrelevant, which is a mistake, then mitigation becomes useless, and that is another mistake.&rdquo;Lesiit said Kenya should have procedures for judicial officers to follow before arriving at the death sentence after convicting an offender.SENTENCING GUIDELINESThe judge gave an example of South Africa, where the death sentence is provided for, but laws provide for guidelines on how to arrive at death sentence, unlike in Kenya, where it is automatic.&ldquo;The law says this is the yardstick you will use to determine whether to give death sentence or not. The judges in SA have to follow the guidelines in the law to determine whether a case is appropriate for the death sentence. It is not automatic like ours,&rdquo; Lesiit said.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have that guideline of determining what sentence to give because our law is that if you have found a person has committed robbery under stroke two, the sentence is this one [death].&rdquo;In SA, the statute guides the court for what to look for.The statute makes it mandatory for the court to look and be satisfied, for instance, that the action was aggravated, there was use of certain weapons, or was clearly showing the intention was maybe to cause grievous harm. &ldquo;Article six of it provides that human beings have inherent right to life and this right should be protected by the law and no one should be arbitrarily deprived of his life,&rdquo; Lesiit said. &lsquo;What we said in our case is that we should align our laws to international best practices, and this is an international instrument, which is saying that the right to life should be protected and should not be taken arbitrarily.&rdquo;Lesiit said arbitral taking away of life is happening in Kenya because of failure to clarify, distinguish with clarity those various aggravations of offences so that you pass the death penalty for the most serious offence not just for ngeta [simple robbery using bare hands and minimal violence]. She said there should be variations in sentencing so that the more serious offence should get a more serious penalty, for purposes of proportion.&ldquo;Somebody of ngeta can&rsquo;t be treated the same way as one who comes with a grenade, homemade bombs or petrol bomb to blow up your premises if you don&rsquo;t open for them. How can they get the same sentence?&rdquo; Lesiit said.She said that means the law takes away life in an arbitral way.&ldquo;Our law needs to be aligned so that it stops looking like we are not serious with what we are doing,&rdquo; Lesiit said. &ldquo;Many countries have continued to look at their laws and amend them to create those distinctions to identify aggravations and the sentences that would be proportional to those aggravations, but ours has remained static, which is a mistake.&rsquo;
