One in five Australians reported being the victim of "revenge porn", according to a new study.The national survey of more than 4,200 people found that men and women were equally likely to be targeted.But men were more likely to be perpetrators, while women held more safety fears, said Australia's first comprehensive research on the subject.The findings showed that the abuse was more widespread than previously thought, researchers said.A fifth of respondents had a sexual or nude image taken without their consent, according to the RMIT University and Monash University study.It found that 11% had images shared without consent, while 9% had been threatened that an image would be distributed.The risk of victimisation was higher for minority groups including indigenous, disabled and LGBT [lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender] Australians.The researchers recommended making image-based abuse a federal crime and creating a helpline similar to one established in the UK in 2015."Image-based abuse has emerged so rapidly as an issue that inevitably our laws and policies are struggling to catch up," said lead researcher Dr Nicola Henry."This is not just about 'revenge porn' - images are being used to control, abuse and humiliate people in ways that go well beyond the 'relationship gone sour' scenario."Only two states - Victoria and South Australia - have specific laws against distributing images without consent.
