Deputy President William Ruto may find himself in a dilemma during Jubilee Party campaigns in his home county of Uasin Gishu where his allies Governor Jackson Mandago and businessman Bundotich Kiprop, popularly known as Buzeki, will battle over the governor&rsquo;s seat.In Ruto&rsquo;s home constituency of Turbo, the victory by Kevin Okwara in primaries for the MP seat also puts the DP in a tight spot, following protests by some residents and aspirants against Okwara, whom they argue is not a local.Okwara is a Luhya, but a resident and leading investor in Eldoret town and in the primaries he defeated 18 aspirants &mdash; all of them from the local community.Aspirants gang up against non-localThe aspirants who lost to Okwara have supported Janet Koech to run as an independent against him. Most of them want the DP to keep off the campaigns in the area, as he will be forced to campaign for JP candidate Okwara.Okwara said, &ldquo;I thank the DP for ensuring that democracy prevails and that I am given the Jubilee ticket because I won the primaries fairly.&ldquo;All I know is that I am a resident of Turbo and the win is not for any community. In fact, many of those who voted for me are Kalenjins and I will represent everyone if elected.&rdquo;Buzeki is a close ally of Ruto and his decision to run as an independent candidate will also test the DP&rsquo;s political muscle because Mandago will expect Jubilee to fully back his bid.Buzeki said, &ldquo;I will run as an independent and seek votes for President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP Ruto because if there is anyone with the capacity to give them votes in Uasin Gishu then it&rsquo;s Buzeki.&rdquo;The DP&rsquo;s aides, led by Farouk Kibet and Reuben Maiyo, are accused of having supported some candidates during the JP primaries and it will be interesting to watch how Ruto handles the unfolding political scenario in Uasin Gishu.However, Dr Swarrup Mishra&rsquo;s win in the primaries for Kesses MP will give the DP reason to back Okwara in Turbo, because Mishra too is not from the local community and he won the polls in an area that has a larger Kalenjin population than Turbo.
