Judges have told the government to ensure their safety when handling election petitions. Led by judge (Rtd) Mary Ang&rsquo;awa, they cited instances in which their lives have been threatened when handling such cases. Ang&rsquo;awa, who spoke during the International Association of Women Judges - African Region Conference, recalled being threatened by parties in the Kamukunji election petition that saw incumbent Simon Mbugua lose his seat in 2011. &ldquo;Many Judges who handled that case had to bow out due to the level of threats issued against them. They even went ahead and threatened their families if the ruling never went in their favour. I was stationed outside Nairobi, but I was transferred to come and handle this case,&rdquo; she said. Ang&rsquo;awa said that at some point, someone smashed her car with the aim of causing her harm. She added, &ldquo;Our police never do any assessment on our security level.&rdquo;
