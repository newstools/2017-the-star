Matayos MP hopeful Jones Ochieng has asked the Jubilee secretariat to respect voters’ wishes and issue him with a nomination certificate. He said the area is not an opposition stronghold. He said Matayos is a cosmopolitan constituency. “Jubilee is popular that’s why the people of Matayos recognise the government and have produced the largest number of aspirants in Busia county and the entire region,” Ochieng said. A fortnight ago a feud erupted after it was alleged one candidate was favoured by the party. Two candidates were declared winner. Polycarp Onyango, who got less that 1,000 votes, was declared winner. Ochieng garnered 2,256 votes The party annulled the process and declared it will not field any Jubilee candidate in Matayos.
