Individuals who will fail to file annual returns for 2016 by June 30 deadline face a fine of five per cent of the tax due or a maximum of Sh20,000, the Kenya Revenue Authority said yesterday.The taxman said the new regime came into effect in January this year, warning that it will not tolerate those who fail to file their individual income tax returns on or before June 30.&ldquo;We encourage people to file returns on time. The taxman will not carry any responsibilities,&rdquo; KRA acting assistant manager for domestic taxes Wanja Wang&rsquo;ondu said during a stakeholders&rsquo; forum in Nairobi. &ldquo;You have had six months since January but many people like the last minute rush. We encourage people to avoid this and file their returns early.&rdquo;The KRA requires taxpayers to file their returns online through the iTax platform.Last year, hundreds of disappointed taxpayers were turned away after KRA&rsquo;s staff at iTax support centres closed shop after 5pm.KRA has been encouraging taxpayers through sensitisation seminars to file their returns between January and June.The National Treasury expects the KRA to raise Sh1.7 trillion in ordinary revenues in the financial year 2017-18 from July. This is about Sh188.5 billion on top of the Sh1.5 trillion revised target for the current financial year ending on June 30.Tax collection in nine months through March 31 fell short of the Sh950.25billion revised target by 8.58 per cent on pro rata basis, National Treasury data shows.CS Henry Rotich said in a Statement of Actual Revenues and Net Exchequer Issues, published in the Kenya Gazette last month, total tax revenue stood at Sh868.75 billion against Sh1.267 trillion full-year target.This is, however, Sh92.87 billion, or 11.97 per cent, more than the Sh775.88 billion the Kenya Revenue Authority collected in the same period last financial year. The collection accounted for 64.83 per cent of government&rsquo;s total revenue of Sh1.34 trillion in the nine-month period. The total revenue is a growth of 8.06 per cent over the Sh1.24 trillion in first nine months of 2015-16 financial year.A relatively tough operating environment for the private sector and a freeze on new employment by the government since November 2013, has continued to pose a challenge to the taxman meeting revised tax target for this financial year. Rotich renewed the moratorium on December 21 last year.
