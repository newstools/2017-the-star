Sis people have recorded statements with CID in a probe on the murder of three children of Eldoret MCA aspirant James Ratemo. They include a key witness who claims to have seen the prime suspect Enock Onsase with the children on the day they went missing. Others are Ratemo's wife, Ebby, a cousin to the children and a caretaker at Ratemo's Kapsoya home. Onsase, the children's uncle, is still in police custody as investigations are finalised before he is arraigned on June 6. "All the family members required by police to record statements have already done so and we are informed that investigations are still going on," said Charles Nyamweya, a lawyer the Ratemo family. Police are also still examining mobile phone communication by the prime suspect to establish if other people were involved. Data from the phone has been taken to Nairobi for analysis before Onsase returns to court next week. The children, children Clifford Nyamweya, 7, Dan Nyamweya, 5, and Glen Ongaki, 3, will be buried at Nyacheke village in Kisii on June 9. A postmortem revealed that they were strangled to death before the bodies were dumped in River Nzoia.

The challenge we had is the bodies had decomposed, having not been preserved for more than three days,” Dr Keittany Kibet said. On Friday Uasin Gishu county rejected a proposal to bury the three murdered children in a residential estate in Eldoret town arguing that Ratemo’s plot was small and the law does not allow burials in urban areas meant for residential estates. When he appeared in court on Tuesday last week, Onsase said he is innocent and asked chief magistrate Charles Obulutsa to have his mobile phone handed back, but the court rejected the request.
