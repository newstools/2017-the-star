The body of a road crash victim who drowned in River Mbogolo, Kilifi county, was retrieved on Thursday, after an 18-hour search. Kahindi Charo’s body was found by divers at the bottom of the seasonal river. “It had been trapped by huge boulders on the riverbed,” Edward Kahindi told the Star at the scene. Charo’s mother Mwanaidi Hamisi was inconsolable as she mourned her 27-year-old son who went missing on Wednesday. Divers performed rituals to avert a misfortune. They “talked to Charo’s spirits not to disturb them at night”. Charo was with two colleagues when the driver lost control of a canter, which then crashed through guard rails and plunged into the river. A witness said the driver tried to avoid an oncoming taxi on a rain-slicked road. The two were quickly rescued and taken to the county hospital, where they are recovering. The river had swollen due to a downpour on Wednesday morning. Senator Emma Mbura offered to offset some of the funeral expenses. She called on the county government to repair the bridge and said area should be labelled a black spot.
