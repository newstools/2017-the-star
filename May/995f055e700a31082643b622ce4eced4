Africans have trolled Ali Kiba for performing in what appeared to be a skirt and womenâ€™s headgear. Last weekend, Ali Kiba, one of the most celebrated Bongo stars in Tanzania, was performing at a lip-sync battle with a Nigerian artiste, Simi. Ali Kiba won. It was not the winning that captured the attention of the people, the Chekecha Cheketua hitmaker stepped out rocking a cute skirt. Here are some of the reactions. frank mzirayi4128: Mbona kama wa kike au Mimi ndio sioni. frenkjoseph7691: We unataka kaskite au mkanda. mau_santiagohhio: Mini kama coo yako cjuii. olivejune7: Umevaa dress ama ni hauz?????
