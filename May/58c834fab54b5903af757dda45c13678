Gender-based violence remains a threat to women empowerment, despite efforts to deal with the challenge.This came out during a meeting meant to deliberate on how to sustain the campaign.Gender CS Sicily Kariuki yesterday told a group of women&rsquo;s rights organisations of her encounter with a woman who had just been violently attacked.Kariuki said she was on her way to the Pan-African Women&rsquo;s Conference at the Crowne Plaza, Nairobi, and had to stop and enquire from the woman, who was in distress, as she screamed and cried outside the Central police station.Upon enquiring what had happened, her security guards learnt that the woman had been attacked.&ldquo;I saw this woman cry and in distress. I had to stop the car and urge my security men to look into the issue. If at all the lady was sick, I had decided that I would ensure she gets treatment,&rdquo; Kariuki said.&ldquo;But we later realised she had been beaten. I immediately called the OCPD at the station and urged him to look into the matter.&rdquo;She had to leave the scene but promised to follow up the matter with the law enforcement officers.Kariuki said gender-based violence remains one of the most pervasive violations of human rights, a great threat to lasting peace and development and a stumbling block to women empowerment.The government has put in place institutional measures to deal with all forms of GBV. They include the Anti-FGM Board and the National Gender and Equality Commission.&ldquo;Despite the milestones in gender equality and women empowerment, a lot remains to be done,&rdquo; she said.Kariuki said besides legal and policy interventions, the government is focusing on civic education.&ldquo;A great percentage of women remain unaware of their rights and the available interventions, hence continue to suffer in silence,&rdquo; she said.The CS urged women&rsquo;s rights organisations and FEMNET, which hosted the event, to continue using their networks and capabilities to educate women, especially those living in impoverished conditions, on their legal, social and economic rights.She said women need to feel comfortable and come out to report cases of gender-based discrimination and violence.
