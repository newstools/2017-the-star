The East African Data Centre has been awarded tier-three certification for delivering nearly 100 per cent uptime in its electricity supply, cooling and IT systems at the data centre. EADC, a subsidiary of Liquid Telecom Kenya, offers secure space for dedicated hosting, interconnect services, collocation, disaster recovery, network-based services, applications and cloud services. The firm received the certification from the global Uptime Institute, the only firm in the world licensed to rate and certify designs, constructed facilities and ongoing operations against its Classification System and Operational Sustainability criteria. &ldquo;This is an important step in data centre guarantees in Kenya and East and Central Africa, as EADC joins the relatively few data centres across the world in gaining the Uptime Institute Tier 3 Design Certification,&rdquo; EADC general manager Dan Kwach said.
