Pokot and Samburu have been returning in large numbers to west and north Laikipia in the last 10 days.It has rained more in their home areas than it has in Laikipia so their return looks like a plan to displace registered voters before August 8, or a move to make a permanent land grab in Laikipia.The county commissioner says the government is struggling to clear Laikipia and that it has recovered 15 guns in the last two months.That is trivial. In the last six months around 10,000 pastoralists have killed people and wild animals, stolen cattle, and done millions of shillings of damage to small and large farms.The government appears reluctant to crack down fully on the pastoralists so close to the election. But it is raining more to the north of Laikipia. This is no longer about grazing. It is something more dangerous than that. The government should stop it, election or no election.Quote of the day: "&ldquo;Listen to them, the children of the night.
