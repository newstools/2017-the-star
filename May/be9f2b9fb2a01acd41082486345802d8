The technicality of holding a delegates&rsquo; convention to endorse the Presidential candidate is still with Kenyans, two general elections under the new Constitution of Kenya 2010 and for the 12th General Election since Independence.This was the case on March 4 2013, when Uhuru Kenyatta ran on the The National Alliance ticket and Raila Odinga on the Orange Democratic Movement, despite both contenders heading up coalitions &ndash; respectively the Jubilee Alliance and the Coalition for Reforms and Democracy.But there is a keen political irony in the former Prime Minister getting to paint the National Super Alliance a bright Orange.The sons respectively of Kenya&rsquo;s founding President Mzee Jomo Kenyatta and founding Vice President Jaramogi Oginga Odinga have travelled widely divergent paths to get to their epic &ndash; and surely final &ndash; duel scheduled for August 8.Towards the end of the week the party primaries ended, both statesmen confirmed they are standing on party, not coalition, tickets and ODM yesterday duly held its national delegates&rsquo; conventions. Jubilee holds its own today at Bomas of Kenya.In the run-up to the 2013 General Election, as Cord looked for a unified Presidential candidate, there was some macabre joshing between Raila and Wiper&rsquo;s Kalonzo Musyoka on political podiums about the one &ldquo;dying&rdquo; for the other. What they were asking was which one would run that year and be President for only one term (2013-17) and who would be running mate so as to become President in August this year. As it turned out, Kalonzo &ldquo;died&rdquo; for Raila, but both were thwacked at the ballot by Uhuru and William Ruto.Raila and Kalonzo were bad losers, dashing straight to the Willy Mutunga Supreme Court, and losing there too, and then boycotting the UhuRuto Inauguration at the Kasarani Stadium by the expedient of flying out to South Africa.Later, wearing typical politician smiles and glad-handing like mad, Raila and Kalonzo visited President Uhuru and Deputy President Ruto at State House, Nairobi, for one of the most told-you-so photo-op moments of Kenyan politics.Now, less than 100 days to August 8, the same pair of Presidential contenders is squaring out for a titanic rematch.Uhuru and Raila have taken very different paths to the coming contest. The President has had a truncated first term of four years and has a track record to point to and to be evaluated against by friend, foe and neutral. The former Prime Minister has consistently been the primus inter pares (first among equals) among the Opposition leaders and has led a number of big initiatives, such as the violent street demos against the Issack Hassan team at the IEBC that made headlines around the world and resulted in the Wafula Chebukati team.UhuRuto&rsquo;s Jubilee has evolved in its first term from the TNA and URP victors of 2013 to Jubilee Party, launched in September 2016 as a big tent affair absorbing 11 parties.There has been dramatic evolution inside Cord too, marked by an inexorable march in the direction of confirming Raila&rsquo;s preeminence and the Orange party brand. In the process, Cord principals Kalonzo Musyoka of Wiper and Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula of Ford-K have plunged ever deeper into ODM&rsquo;s shadow, and now so has Musalia Mudavadi of the Amani National Congress. As the three-month-long nomination of the NASA flagbearer dragged on and on, elements of the Kamba and the Luhya showed their stress, with demands such as &ldquo;No Kalonzo, no NASA&rdquo; and &ldquo;No Musalia, no NASA&rdquo;, fashioned after the 2007 PEV slogan of &ldquo;No Raila, no peace&rdquo; that drove the conflagration like wildfire in its first days.As the tension rose, it looked for a while as if NASA would be stillborn, until Thursday April 27, when Raila was finally unveiled as standard-bearer. Raila&rsquo;s enthronement and ODM&rsquo;s primaries, which were shambolic but nonetheless second only to JP&rsquo;s in national outreach, far outstripping anything Wiper, Ford Kenya and ANC could mount, worked together to make the Orange party unquestionably the preeminent political formation inside NASA.From where Jubilee stood, waiting to see what kind of opponent NASA would produce, Raila&rsquo;s nomination looked very much like the death of the NASA dream and the rebirth of the Orange factor. Kalonzo&rsquo;s acceptance of the running mate position yet again, after all his uncharacteristically tough talk about implementing the 2013 MoU with Raila, appeared to be mealy mouthed at best.When the NGO Board moved in on Kalonzo by freezing the Kalonzo Musyoka Foundation&rsquo;s accounts in an apparent investigation of money laundering, analysts read an element of borrowing a leaf from the FBI&rsquo;s investigation of Candidate Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s emails scandal at the worst possible time &ndash; bang in the middle of the US presidential campaign.A ferocious propaganda and counterpropaganda campaign will preface the August 8 race for State House and Jubilee is likely to focus on what it will undoubtedly characterize as the stillbirth of the NASA dream and the rebirth of the Orange dominance in the Opposition and a bleak near future for Wiper and both Ford-K and the ANC.Jubilee is likely to keep a laser-sharp counterpropaganda focus on the divide-and-scatter theme that all the NASA flagbearer campaign has achieved is Wiper, Ford-K and ANC having given much-needed mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to the Orange party.Key pro-Raila businesspeople such as Jimmy Wanjigi and strategists/communicators like David Ndii and Salim Lone had no peers in Wiper, Ford Kenya and the ANC and controlled the NASA merger narrative for years even before April 27, 2017.Writing &ldquo;a note of caution&rdquo; addressed to President Barack Obama in the Weekend Star&rsquo;s Siasa pullout on the day he landed in Kenya in July 2015, Lone warned ominously, &ldquo;Another flawed election will doom democracy and stability in Kenya, and spell trouble for the rest of the world&rdquo;.Wiper, Ford-K and ANC had no operative, in the process of choosing the NASA kingpin, who could publish such brinkmanship and bombast &ndash; and mean every word of it.
