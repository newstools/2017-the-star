Garissa governor aspirant Ali Korane on Wednesday called for immediate halt to the &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; survey and re-planning of congested Garissa town.&ldquo;People are very fearful they may lose their property, houses,&rdquo; the Jubilee Party nominee said.The public and key stakeholds are unaware of the plans and need to be informed, he told the press.&ldquo;We know land is an emotive issue and especially when it touches on the landless and squatters. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true that the town is congested and poorly planned, but any process meant to correct this should be treated with sensitivity.&rdquo;Such a sensitive matter should follow legal procedures that include, among other issues, public participation, he said. The whole process is illegal and must stop,&rdquo; he said.Korane said a team of surveyors has been going round marking houses and other structures, apparently for demolition or relocation, without a word to the public. He said it is only prudent that all the stakeholders are educated. &ldquo;Somebody cannot wake up one day and start planning the town. This is a recipe for disaster,&rdquo; Korane said.He said the replanning, allegedly sponsored by the World Bank, is creating fear and panic among residents.Deputy director in charge of urban planning Sahlan Keinan could not be reached on the phone for comment.Last year the town&rsquo;s sewer line broke down for t a month, forcing many residents to relocate. Repairs were to take 18 months.
