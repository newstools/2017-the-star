Deputy President William Ruto's has my name fresh in his mind more than his own wife, Baringo Senator Gideon Moi has said.Senator Moi said the DP's mission for Baringo and entire Rift Valley region is purely for his own selfish gain.He said: "I guess every time Ruto is free with his wife he is ever singing my name Gideon, Gideon, Gideon..."Moi said the DP's obsession is to see him voted out during the August 8 election."I think this forces him to sing my name even in his 'bedroom'."Moi is facing off with former Betting and Licensing boss Simon Chelugui for the legislative seat."The DP simply wants me to vanish in politics so that he succeeds President Uhuru Kenyatta in 2022," he said.He made the comments during his campaign launch at Kabimoi, Eldama-Ravine, Baringo county on Saturday.Moi said his political nemesis frequents Baringo more than any other place in the country.The two have been going gloves off in attacks against one another following their bid to control the Rift Valley vote.Read: Senator Moi cannot match me academically, says DP RutoAlso read: Gideon Moi is uncircumcised, says DP RutoHe added that the DP pledges and channels Jubilee administration projects worth millions of shillings to Baringo."This is not because he loves the people here but for a simple interest to make me voted out in August," he said.His sentiments came barely a week after Jubilee nominees in Baringo proclaimed that Kanu is dead and gone."Mark it right from me that once you vote me out and replace me with another Senator in August, you will never ever see Ruto stepping his foot here."Moi recalled his political rivalry with DP Ruto picked in during the Kericho Senator by-election in 2014.At the time, the DP rallied behind Aaron Cheruiyot who was facing off with Paul Sang of Kanu.The legislator urged residents to resist being deceived to 'castrate their own bull&rsquo; while other communities retain theirs.He urged voters to back President Uhuru Kenyatta for a second term.
