Mother's Day is just around the corner and we got a hold of Kiss FM radio presenter Jeff Mote who believes that mothers should be celebrated every day regardless of the day or time."Mother's day is special but for your mother I just believe it should be everyday because a mother is everything and always the most special lady in your life," he stated.Jeff went ahead to disclose the one thing he loves the most about his mother was that "she always supports me and will always be there for me no matter what happens. She is the ultimate day one ninja."Before rushing to the studio, we asked him for his most memorable moment with his mother and just like every kid, the punishments were the highlights when growing up."Well, do the punishments count because I look back on them now that I'm all grown and they're just too funny.He finished off by stating that he will definitely be getting her a gift, "I'll definitely get her a gift. I mean, I'm Mama Jeff's favourite child now aren't I....Haha, don't let her see that last part."
