Five Mandera MPs yesterday asked the government to deploy more Kenya Defence Forces soldiers to curb increasing terror attacks by al Shabaab.The legislators, led by Abdulaziz Farah (Mandera East), Bare Shill (Fafi) and Mohamed Elmi (Tarbaj) raised a concern that the attacks, if not contained immediately, may affect the August general elections.Shill said the soldiers should be equipped with better facilities to address the terror problem. The legislators added that their lives could be in danger as they traverse constituencies and wards when campaigns start on Sunday.&ldquo;It will be difficult to conduct elections if the current trend of insecurity increases,&rdquo; Farah said. He pointed out that a senior chief was killed recently followed by an attack on Mandera Governor Ali Roba.
