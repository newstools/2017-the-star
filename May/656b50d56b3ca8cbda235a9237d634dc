Luanda MP Chris Omulele has criticised the government for reducing the CDF allocation to his constituency by Sh35 million.He said this has hampered completion of some projects. &ldquo;The main reason why some crucial projects have not been completed is insufficient funds,&rdquo; Omulele said. The MP said the constituency can be transformed if the state allocates it enough funds. He said murram roads, schools, bridges and giving out bursaries are some projects the constituency has undertaken. &ldquo;These roads will enable our children to access schools safely and parents to transport their goods to markets effectively,&rdquo; Omulele said. He addressed Emabungo ward resident at Ebusakami Primary School on Sunday.
