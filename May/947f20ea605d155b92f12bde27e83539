Wiper Party suffered a major setback on Friday after the Political Parties Disputes Tribunal nullified Wavinya Ndeti&rsquo;s win in the nominations for Machakos governor.The party was also ordered to carry out fresh primaries within 48 hours.The tribunal said the party held the polls on April 30 despite a court order stopping the exercise. &ldquo;The defendant&rsquo;s [Ndeti] nomination was carried out in disobedience of the orders of this tribunal. Therefore it&rsquo;s of no effect in law,&rdquo; PPDT chairperson Kyalo Mbobu said yesterday. Mbobu said Wiper will pay all costs of the suit filed by Deputy Governor Bernard Kiala. Kiala was in the governor race.&ldquo;I respect the decision of the tribunal and we are ready to go back to the polls. I know I will win,&rdquo; Ndeti told her supporters yesterday. The former Kathiani MP had been given the nominations certificate to fly the Wiper flag in Machakos after she was declared the winner with 299,312 votes against Kiala&rsquo;s 4,663.Kiala had earlier filed a petition at the tribunal, accusing Wiper of colluding with Ndeti to deny him the ticket. The deputy governor had said he spent immense resources to campaign, hence a direct nomination would have been an affront to democracy. He also wanted the tribunal to rule whether Wavinya was a bonafide member of Wiper.
