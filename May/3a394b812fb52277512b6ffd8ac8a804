Wiper has dismissed a letter claiming leader Kalonzo Musyoka has quit NASA and will vie under for president under the party.The letter stated that Kalonzo had quit NASA, which chose him as ODM leader Raila Odinga's running mate in the election.More on this:In a statement on Saturday, Wiper secretary general Hassan Omar said Kalonzo has not opted out of the National Super Alliance."How does anyone in his right mind believe such nonsense and how does anyone expect me, or Kalonzo for that matter, to respond to stupidity from Jubilee's spin doctors?" he asked.The letter dated May 5 says Kalonzo left for reasons including unfounded frustrations, underhand dealings and lack of commitment by other leaders.The others in the coalition are Moses Wetang'ula (Ford Kenya), Isaac Rutto (Bomet Governor, Chama Cha Mashinani) and Musalia Mudavadi (Amani National Congress).The claim came after Raila was endorsed as presidential candidate by ODM's National Delegates Convention at Kasarani stadium in Nairobi on Friday.Read: NASA seeks billions as ODM unveils RailaThe jury is still out on whether Kalonzo secured a raw deal in the NASA pact signed last week.Despite voting for Raila overwhelmingly in 2013, some in Ukambani feel they will end up with little, notwithstanding Wiper is a founder member of NASA, the Alliance Raila now heads.Minority leader Francis Nyenze, a key Kalonzo ally, was the first to openly voice his concern over the NASA deal when it was unveiled after months of intense negotiations.&ldquo;It is going to be a difficult task to convince the Kamba nation to play second fiddle when they played that in 2013," he told a press conference he held jointly with Kitui Senator David Musila."In 2017, they expected their son to be flag bearer. These are things I say as a senior member of Wiper and as a Kamba leader and it is good to tell the truth and shame the devil."More on this: Did Kalonzo get raw deal in NASA lineup?Also read: Wiper downplays Nyenze's claim of 'Kalonzo going it alone' over NASA ticket row
