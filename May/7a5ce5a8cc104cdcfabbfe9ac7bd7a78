Murang&rsquo;a Senator Kembi Gitura has asked winners of the Jubilee Party nominations to stop affiliating independent candidates with the opposition.Gitura said it is wrong to label independents rebels simply because they are not running on the Jubilee ticket.The senator lost to Kiharu MP Irungu Kang&rsquo;ata in the senate primaries and will defend his seat as an independent.Gitura said most Jubilee aspirants ditched the party because they were rigged out.He said he filed a complaint with the Jubilee Party&rsquo;s disputes tribunal asking for a repeat of the exercise in Mathioya and Kiharu constituencies. But he resigned after he felt the party was taking too long to resolve the dispute.The senator spoke to the press in Murang&rsquo;a town on Saturday.Gitura cited massive rigging and stuffing of boxes in the two constituencies. He said it was impossible for him to lose in his own constituency.The senator described the nominations as shambolic, saying winners did not win fairly, and are now going around chest-thumping and intimidating independents.&ldquo;The fact that there are more than 4,500 aspirants who are vying as independent candidates shows that the nominations were botched,&rdquo; Gitura said.He said he has been campaigning for President Uhuru Kenyatta since he declared he would defend his seat, and will support him all the way to the election.&ldquo;It would be therefore very unfair for my competitors to spread lies that I am now supporting NASA,&rdquo; Gitura said.He said the President has embraced parties friendly to JP, which indicates he values all votes and would not mind support from independents.Gitura, who is also the Senate Deputy speaker, asked JP winners to give independents space.He said it is their constitutional right to seek elective seats independently.
