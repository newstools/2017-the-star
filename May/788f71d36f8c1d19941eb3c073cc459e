One out of 10 standard eight children in Baringo county cannot do standard two work, latest research has shown.It further says only 17 per cent of standard three children can do standard two work.The report was released in Kabarnet on Friday by Uwezo Kenya, a nongovernmental organisation.Coordinator Lawrence Kiplagat said 44 per cent of children in lower parts of Baringo enrol late for school.&ldquo;This could be because the majority of the children hail from pastoral communities, where they are being tasked with taking care of family livestock,&rdquo; Kiplagat said.He said the most vulnerable regions are the lower parts of Baringo North, South and Tiaty, which are mainly inhabited by the Tugen, Pokot and Ilchamus communities.In terms of literacy levels, the study found that 81 per cent of standard three pupils cannot do standard two work.&ldquo;Meaning only 19 per cent of them can read or write in either simple English or Kiswahili,&rdquo; Kiplagat said.The report further reveals that 68 per cent of pupils in standard three in lower parts of the county cannot solve a standard two math problem.&ldquo;Only those in the same class in the highlands and urban areas were better,&rdquo; Kiplagat said.He said the county government has given less attention to early childhood development and education.Kiplagat said ECDE has not fared as well as it used to under the national government before it was devolved.The report indicates high teacher shortage in Tiaty subcounty, compared to the other areas.It recommends that education stakeholders in the county should come together to promote child learning in schools.The Teachers Service Commission Baringo county director presided over the event.Also in attendance was Kenya National Union of Teachers executive secretary Baringo branch Joshua Cheptarus and Marigat subcounty quality assurance officer Gichuki Kimani.They said the county needs to do more and resolved to create an environment conducive to learning, adding that this will foster high-quality education and improve performance and living standards.
