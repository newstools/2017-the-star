Terror has once again struck Britain; this time round in Manchester City, killing 22 and maiming scores of others. Police in the United Kingdom now have a prime suspect. Salman Abedi, a 22 year old British citizen born to Libyan parents, a university drop out. He died in the attack which targeted young fans of Ariana Grande, an American pop star, as they left the concert.The University of Salford near Manchester, in statement, have confirmed that Abedi had been one of its students - although he reportedly dropped out in recent years.The involvement of university students in acts of terror is clearly on the increase. In Kenya, two medical interns at the Malindi Hospital, Mohamed Shukri and Abdulrazak Abdinuur, both studying Medicine at Saratove State Medical University in Russia were arrested by officers from Anti-Terror Police Unit (ATPU) on suspicion of having links to a terror group.In February, Anti Terror Police arrested Hassaen Ahmed, a University of Nairobi biochemistry student as he was leaving the country for Libya, reportedly to join Isis.Osama bin Laden was not an illiterate marginalised individual. Similarly, lone attackers in Ft. Lauderdale, San Bernardino, Paris, and London and were all well educated and employed individuals.It seems many known organizations like al-Qaeda have tendrils in university campuses across the world. The apparent link abroad and locally, between scholarly communities and terror should prompt us to revisit the place of institutions of higher learning as platforms for critical reflection around society and culture. Whenever terror strikes, various discourses around Islamism and terror emerge. However, the level of these discourses is often superficial.The rhetoric of &ldquo;terrorism&rdquo; is framed around binaries of terror and counter&ndash;terrorism and the analytical frames of Islamic fundamentalism and political Islam.My students have criticised me for not focusing more explicitly in my research and teaching on those Islamists and Muslim fundamentalists that are assumed to exist a priori.It seems to me like we are all locked up into a state of thinking about the world as divided into competing blocs, the modern Hobbesian imagery about the world in a state of anarchy.Paradoxically, terrorists similarly use the narrative of Othering to commit their atrocities.Thus we all reproduce somewhat uncritically, the discourse of certain twentieth-century self-styled Islamists who articulate their own views of Islamism and the future and inevitable triumph of Islam.By analyzing terror through the lens of fundamentalism and political Islam alone, we assume the existence of a monolithic Islam.Such assumptions thrive on teleological narratives of progressive Islamisation to which Orientalists and social scientists have long subscribed.In this frame, my undergraduate students frequently inquire about the &ldquo;Abuja declaration&rdquo;, a little-known document, which is purported to lay down a blue-print for the Islamisation of Africa!Some commentators naively assert that Muslim societies will not and simply cannot, undergo processes of secularisation and/or the privatisation of religion presumed for the modern West. It is assumed that all Muslim societies will necessarily undergo similar processes of Islamisation.Such processes are believed to manifest in the form of revival and reform, which in &lsquo;radical&rsquo; guises or &lsquo;resurgence&rsquo; might entail Jihad (struggle).In most cases, the politics of these conflicts are completely erased from the discussion. While this amnesia might not explain radicalization, it might assist us understand the context of recruitment.Political scientist and policy advisor Samuel Huntington has written about the coming &lsquo;clash of civilizations&rsquo; between the West and its others, including its Muslim Others. Such approaches neglect the discursive traditions of Islam itself.In short, rhetorics of &ldquo;us&rdquo; versus &ldquo;them&rdquo; abound around us and have great potential for profiling &ldquo;the Other&rdquo; in our midst, in manifold ways.At a time like this, when Kenyans are facing a competitive election, such othering can be lethal.Exploiting the binary contrasts of &ldquo;us&rdquo; and &ldquo;them&rdquo;, and &ldquo;believer&rdquo; and disbeliever&rdquo;, they increase the potential for conflict and paint a utopian ideal in which ordinary people could vicariously participate.It is at this point that such reflections put a great responsibility on the academy and especially humanities and social sciences.These disciplines are dedicated to critically reflecting on society, and why people behave the way they do. They generate a multiplicity of lens to balance the uni-focal views of the world that abound in our society.Lately, some of our politicians and technocrats in the education sector have not spoken kindly about humanities and social sciences. This does not bode well for our common future, at uncertain times like this.The writer is a senior lecturer, Department of Religious Studies, St Paul&rsquo;s University.
