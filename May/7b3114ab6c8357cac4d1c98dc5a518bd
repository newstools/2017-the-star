Twenty-eight-year-old IT expert Alex Mutuku, accused of electronic fraud which caused the loss of more than Sh3.9 billion from the KRA, has accused the prosecution of delaying his trial.When the case came up for mention before Milimani chief magistrate Francis Andayi yesterday, Mutuku said the prosecution has not supplied him with all copies of witness statements to enable him to prepare for the case.Mutuku made the complaint after the prosecution sought two months to finish a cyber crime report before the trial proceeds. The magistrate gave the prosecution until July 27 to ensure the report is ready.Earlier, the prosecution had asked the court to order the defence lawyers to collect witness statements themselves from the DCI office in Nairobi, adding the documents were bulky. Mutuku and eight others have denied charges of fraudulently causing the loss of Sh 3.9 billion belonging to the KRA by interfering with the institution&rsquo;s computer systems.Mutuku was told to pay Sh700,000 bail, but he has not yet raised the cash and is in remand. He is charged alongside Embakasi North MP aspirant Joseph Karai and eight others - Calvin Otieno, Albert Kipkechem, Lucy Wamwandu, David Wambugu, Kenneth Riaga, Omar Ibrahim, James Gakung&rsquo;u and Gilbert Kipkechem - who are KRA employees. They were each released on Sh300,000 bail.The prosecution said the accused committed the offence between March 1, 2015 and March 1, 2016 at an unknown place.Otieno also faces charges of being in possession of an AK-47 rifle and 24 rounds of ammunition without a firearm certificate.Komen was charged with procuring for himself a Toyota Corolla on December 13, 2015 by pretending it was valid from the KRA.Wamwandu, who is a supervisor at the domestic taxes department, was also charged separately with stealing Sh1 billion of company property.Riaga faced another charge of abuse of office by altering and falsifying KRA electronic records.The prosecution had told the court Mutuku has the potential to interfere with computer servers remotely, is a threat to national security and has been working with suspects outside Kenya. During plea taking, the prosecutors told the court the offences committed led to loss of Sh3.9 billion in several national and financial institutions.The court heard there are indications from data Mutuku and his accomplices were working with other suspects outside the country to remotely access critical information systems in national and financial institutions.The court also heard the ongoing digital evidence discovery is likely to provide more links.
