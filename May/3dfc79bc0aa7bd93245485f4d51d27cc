National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale wants Parliament to enact a law that will empower the IEBC to carry out party primaries three or six months before a general election.He was reacting to last week&rsquo;s party primaries that were marred by violence, manipulation, bribery and outright theft.Duale said it is obvious parties do not have the capacity to carry out the nominations. &ldquo;This is because of the enormous logistics and resources required for the primaries,&rdquo; he said.Duale addressed the press in Garissa town yesterday.He praised Jubilee Party for carrying out what he termed &ldquo;free, fair and credible nominations&rdquo;.Duale said, however, the party also encountered hiccups that mainly revolved around logistics.The party cancelled nominations across the country after confusion and delays marred the exercise on April 21. JP officials said the decision was made in consideration of the safety of voters and aspirants.The party primaries were held from last Monday to Wednesday.So far, more than 400 petitions are being handled by the Jubilee tribunal.In ODM too, a number of primaries complaints are being resolved. &ldquo;Despite the huge number of complaints, we are sure the cases will be disposed of within the shortest time possible,&rdquo; Duale said.&ldquo;The much-talked-about tyranny of numbers will be another tyranny of numbers. I anticipate JP will have more than 200 MPs out of the 290 in the 12th National Assembly and more than 30 senators in the Senate.&rdquo; Duale said starting next week, Jubilee will launch campaigns in which it will present its scorecard for the last four years. He also told off the NASA team, led by ODM leader Raila Odinga and Wiper&rsquo;s Kalonzo Musyoka.Duale dismissed NASA positions reserved for ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi, Ford Kenya&rsquo;s Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula and CCM&rsquo;s Isaac Rutto, saying they do not exist in the Constitution. He claimed money changed, hands and Kalonzo, Musalia, Wetangula and Rutto were bribed into accepting the positions. Under the NASA arrangement, Raila will be flagbearer, Kalonzo his running mate and Mudavadi the Premier Cabinet Secretary.Mudavadi will be deputised by Wetang&rsquo;ula and Rutto.
