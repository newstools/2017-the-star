Mombasa Jubilee governor hopeful Suleiman Shahbal, a banker and businessman, yesterday dismissed reports Kenya&rsquo;s Sh4 trillion debt will lead to an economic crisis. He told the Star on the phone that the debt is manageable. Many economists and the public have expressed concerns the Jubilee government is over-borrowing and say repayment will be a problem. It is not clear whether some of loans are concessional or commercial. The country&rsquo;s debt is a record Sh4 trillion. If it is commercial, many economists say the country is doomed, because it will pay more to service the interest. This, in turn, poses a great threat to an economy in which growth slumped by 0.4 per cent in 2016, to 5.5 per cent this year, they say. Already, 20 per cent of the national budget is used for offsetting loans. But Shahbal said for an economy to grow, there must be infrastructure and industrialisation fuelled by borrowing. &ldquo;If you want to buy a house, you take a mortgage. If you want to build infrastructure, you take a loan,&rdquo; he said. Shahbal said Kenya cannot develop without transformational projects like the SGR and energy production. &ldquo;The key thing is if the country can afford to repay the debt? Yes it can. Don&rsquo;t get upset with the Sh3 billion or Sh4 billion being borrowed &mdash; they are utilised in development, not paying salaries,&rdquo; he said. Shahbal said projects undertaken using the money from loans will improve the economy. &ldquo;When you build infrastructure, in this case the SGR, you open up rural areas,&rdquo; he said. Shahbal said Egypt borrowed heavily from Russia to build the Aswan Dam, which helped industrialise the nation. &ldquo;Egypt&rsquo;s cost of electricity came down drastically. The US borrowed to build the Interstate Highway System, Interstate Freeways and China borrowed to build the Three Gorges Dam. No country can create employment via industrialisation without borrowing,&rdquo; he said.
