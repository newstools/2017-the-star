ODM national treasurer Timothy Bosire has accused the DP of "poking his nose&rdquo; into the affairs of the Opposition and spreading the wrong narrative about NASA.The Kitutu Masaba MP said Deputy President William Ruto of has accused the top brass of the National Super Alliance top brass of only being after power sharing power at the public's expense.&ldquo;It is unfortunate that the DP is jittery about NASA&rsquo;s plan to democratically take over power. It is not his business whatsoever to poke his nose into what our strategy is,&rdquo; Bosire told the Star in a phone interview on Tuesday."Is the DP speaking from the moon or is it that he has lost touch with reality?" The coalition settled on ODM leader Raila Odinga as its flag bearer and Wiper's Kalonzo Musyoka as his running mate. The others principals are Isaac Rutto (Chama Cha Mashinani), Moses Wetang'ula (Ford Kenya) and Musalia Mudavadi (Amani National Congress).Raila said NASA will be a transitional and transformational government that will clean the Jubilee administration's mess.More on this: [VIDEO] 'Happy' Raila welcomes Nasa flag bearer position, ready to face Uhuru in pollsAlso see: NASA creating 'phantom jobs' to abuse existing wealth - EsipisuBut Ruto said on Monday that the Opposition is only interested in sharing power, not about addressing the myriad of problems beleaguering Kenyans.&ldquo;Even as we head to the elections we should be reminded that power is not for sharing by the elite. It is for the empowerment of every citizen of our great republic,&rdquo; he said at Uhuru Park in Nairobi during Labour Day celebrations.The DP also said NASA principals are preoccupied with how to take "illegal" positions of power instead of planning on how to create jobs for the millions unemployed youth.More on this: Uhuru dismisses NASA line-up as 'jobs for the boys'Also read: NASA leaders busy sharing 'non-existent positions' - DP RutoBut Bosire reminded Ruto that the Jubilee government is mandated with creating jobs for Kenyans and improving their livelihoods.The lawmaker, a vocal critic of Ruto, said he should instead apologise to the public for being part of a government that has failed to create the jobs youths were promised in 2013.He said Jubilee has thrived on the impoverishment of Kenyans and joblessness among youth "who have been made paupers seeking handouts in their own country".&ldquo;Ruto might have done Biology or Chemistry but he must know that under Jubilee, the economy has shrunk, the processing of goods has spiked and inflation has skyrocketed,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;These are simple things to see but Ruto has the tendency of rubbishing what others have projected [while failing] to implement anything."
