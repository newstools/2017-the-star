He said Pokot residents value education just like members of any other community in Kenya.Cheruiyot said there is need to differentiate between bandits and good people because not everyone in the sub-county is an armed cattle rustler.&ldquo;Statically the teachers who were killed were not shot in Tiaty but attacked in the neighbouring Baringo North and South," he said.Read: Two more killed as Pokot bandits terrorise BaringoAlso read: Baringo MCA, Jubilee Tiaty MP hopeful shot dead in Marigat
