Jubilee Party leaders in Wajir have promised to deliver a 70 per cent plus one vote for President Uhuru Kenyatta and the party&rsquo;s candidates at the August 8 General Election.They said they will ensure the electorate vote for JP just like they did for ODM in 2013.Speaking yesterday during a campaign rally in Tarbaj constituency, Governor aspirant Mohamed Abdi said he is optimistic JP will carry the day.He told residents they will enjoy the fruits of devolution if they reelect him, because he will ensure a fully devolved and functional Ward Development Fund. Abdi said this will enable services and development projects to benefit all the people.&ldquo;I urge the young people to stand up and be counted. We don&rsquo;t want to see anyone being left behind because we are one people that have charted our destiny,&rdquo; he said.Abdi also promised to initiate a county youth service programme that will allow youths to participate in nation building.Tarbaj MP Mohamed Elmi said the mood on the ground is pro-Jubilee, and aspirants contesting on parties not affiliated to JP will lose.Other leaders present included Abdi&rsquo;s running mate Ali Mukhtar, Wajir East MP Abass Sheikh, and his Wajir North counterpart Ibrahim Saney. Leaders who spoke at the rally complained that Governor Ahmed Abdullahi had sidelined them in development matters. They said he runs the county government like a private entity and does not consult. Wajir West MP Abdikadir Ore said the governor adopted a &ldquo;non-participatory approach&rdquo; in managing affairs of the county. Of the region&rsquo;s three counties of Mandera, Garissa and Wajir, the latter overwhelmingly voted for ODM and NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga in 2013. ODM won all the seats except for Wajir East, which was won by Abass Sheikh of URP.
