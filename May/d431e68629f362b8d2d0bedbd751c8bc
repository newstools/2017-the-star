A crisis is looming after the National Treasury failed to remit close to Sh4 billion to pay allowances for nurses and other health workers.Counties have been forced to reallocate monies from other functions but now threaten they will not pay any more until the Treasury remits the finances.&ldquo;No county has received money from the National Treasury to pay the negotiated allowances for nurses and other health workers,&rdquo; said an official from the Council of Governors.The four-month delay could result in a new crisis after members of the Kenya Health Professionals Society threatened to stop working until all allowances are paid.All nurses were awarded up to Sh20,000 nursing allowance every month from December last year.Thousands of other hospital workers in 15 cadres received health service allowances of between Sh7,500 to Sh20,000, while clinical officers received a special Sh10,000 call allowance. In a letter, Treasury PS Kamau Thugge confirmed the Treasury would allocate Sh3.09 billion to pay the allowances from January to June this year.&ldquo;The additional funding and approval to spend the funds have been provided under article 223 of the Constitution pending regularisation in the supplementary budget,&rdquo; he says in a letter to the immediate former Health Principal Secretary Dr Nicholas Muraguri.Thugge said the Treasury would send the money to the Health Ministry, who would then remit to counties. This would happen in two phases with the workers receiving 60 per cent of their allowances January to June and 40 per cent from July this year.
