Despite losing five players to their basketball team, Kaya Tiwi netball side remain positive of retaining the Kwale County Secondary Schools Sports Association title this morning.Maureen Olunayo, Ivy Akoko, Berline Khavere, Teresia Akoth and Irene Anyango who used to turn up for the two teams, decided to stick with the basketball side which has already qualified for the East Africa Games.According to Kenya Secondary School Sports Association regulations, a player who featured in a team already qualified for the East Africa School Games cannot compete for another.Confident coach Philip Onyango remained with Gladys Chepng&rsquo;etich and Yvonne Atieno in netball and had to recruit from primary schools.&ldquo;We went out and recruited from primary schools and we are doing well. The netball team has been training alongside their basketball counterparts since term one and we hope they will perform extremely well and offer strong opposition,&rdquo; said the confident Onyango.Last year during the Brookside East Africa School Games held in Eldoret, there was a confrontation after Kaya Tiwi&rsquo;s Elsa Anyango was brought in from the netball team to play in the basketball finals against Lycee du Lac Tanganyika of Burundi, forcing KSSSA secretary general David Ngugi to intervene.&ldquo;The rule has been there but we are only emphasizing that a student can only play in one sport at the East Africa going forward. There is no tournament in the world that allows a single player to be entered in two or more ball-games, not even the Olympics,&rdquo; intimated Ngugi.&ldquo;We appreciate that there are students who are multi-talented but what KSSSA games are all about giving many students the chance to explore their potential in sports&rdquo; said Ngugi.
