Some governor nominees are grappling with who should be their running mate, three months to the general election.During the nomination campaigns, some incumbents were not accompanied by their deputies as most of them had broken ranks with their bosses.In Kisumu county, Deputy Governor Ruth Odinga had declared interest in running for governor, forcing incumbent Jack Ranguma to campaign alone in the primaries. She later dropped her bid.In Busia and Siaya counties, the governors and their deputies stuck together during nomination campaigns.But due to numerous dynamics in politics, even those governors who stuck with their deputies and secured party tickets are bound to drop their deputies.What to look for in selectionFor instance, the decision to pick a running mate in some counties is pegged on regional balance while in other counties the party takes full responsibility. Generally, voters expect a pair that appeals to all to curb dissolutions and voter apathy that might be generated from an unpleasing lineup.In Siaya, there is a possibility that Governor Cornel Rasanga will be given a new running mate by the party.Rasanga was water tight with his deputy Wilson Ouma during nomination campaigns and managed to secure the ODM party ticket after trouncing his competitors with a wide gap.A recently released survey by Intellectus Strategic Research Company, based in Kisumu and Siaya counties, showed that Siaya Senator James Orengo and Carey Orege would have been the best pair of governor and deputy governor.Poor ranking in surveyThe pair would have delivered 68.9 per cent of Siaya votes at the general election, according to the report.The survey was conducted between April 30 and May 3 and polled 2,304 people randomly selected across the whole county.The survey indicates that 15 per cent of respondents prefer Rasanga as the governor and Carey Orege as the deputy governor.Orege was a governor aspirant and came fourth in ODM primaries after Rasanga, Nicholas Gumbo, and William Oduol.Gumbo, who is running for Siaya governor as an independent, had eight per cent favouring his ticket with Tubman Otieno as his running mate.Some 5.1 per cent supported Rasanga paired with current Deputy Governor Ouma Onyango.Oduol was favoured by one per cent of the respondents to be Orege&rsquo;s running mate, while two per cent of those who were polled were undecided on who would be best for the positions.
