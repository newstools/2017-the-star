Transport operations and business activities later resumed. No casualty was reported.Resident John Muga said they will not vote for ODM candidates if Ooko is not given the certificate.&ldquo;We cannot accept certificates to be issued based on whether ODM leader Raila Odinga knows your parents or if you are his relatives. This nonsense must stop,&rdquo; he said.Mike Ouma said, &ldquo;No Ken, No Raila&rdquo; in Nyando subcounty, adding that the party must respect the will of voters.He said they would rather vote for President Kenyatta if their concerns are not addressed. &ldquo;We cannot have a situation where leaders are being imposed on us every election period,&rdquo; Ouma said.In Kondele, Kisumu town, residents of Migosi ward protested against the issuance of a certificate to Pamela Oyoo instead of Victor Rodgers.
