President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday urged losers in the Jubilee primaries to concede defeat amid concerns that the rising number of independent candidates could pose a major threat to dominant parties.He said Kenya will be a success if poll contenders allow the will of the electorate to prevail because power belongs to the people.&ldquo;Why are people blaming me when the voters made their decision and chose the leaders they want at the nominations?&rdquo; Uhuru asked at State House, Nairobi.&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s accept the decision of the electorate. It&rsquo;s an indication of the level of the entrenchment of democracy in our country.&ldquo;Citizens are enlightened and know that power belongs to them, not to the leaders.&rdquo;The soaring number of candidates resigning from JP and ODM is likely to force Uhuru and NASA chief Raila Odinga back to the drawing board.By early afternoon yesterday, more than 2,000 aspirants, among them political bigwigs, had been cleared to contest as independent candidates and the numbers were still growing.The massive number of applications forced the Registrar of Political Parties Lucy Ndung&rsquo;u to shift base from her office to a restaurant behind her office.Uhuru said the rejection of big names was a signal voters have power in their hands to determine their own destiny, adding that Kenya&rsquo;s democracy is deepening and the will of the people must be respected.He, however, cautioned that the will of the people is not a licence to violence.Murang&rsquo;a Senator and Senate Deputy Speaker Kembi Gitura is among politicians who visited Ndung&rsquo;us office and is reported to have tendered his resignation from Jubilee.He lost in the Murang&rsquo;a Senate race to Kiharu MP Irungu Kang&rsquo;ata.Nairobi governor aspirant Peter Kenneth has also hinted at running as an independent.He termed the primaries a &ldquo;total farce&rdquo;, saying the decision of the party on an appeal he has lodged against Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko, who was announced the winner, will not be final.&ldquo;When we are through with this [party] process, we must take the next step. Our race has not ended. It has just started,&rdquo; Kenneth said.Other Jubilee bigwigs who will contest as independents are Nakuru Governor Kinuthia Mbugua and businessman Bundotich Kiprop, popularly known as Buzeki, who is running for the Uasin Gishu governor.Uhuru delivered his message when he met members of the Nomiya Faith Church from Nyanza. He urged the church to preach peace and unity.&ldquo;I ask religious leaders to help us in preaching peace and uniting the country. Let&rsquo;s be agents of peace, unity and acceptance,&rdquo; Uhuru said.He pointed out that elections should not be a cause for enmity, adding that people have a right to express their will without causing violence.Kenya&rsquo;s diversity is its strength. Uhuru urged Kenyans to appreciate their cultural diversity and live together harmoniously.&ldquo;Kenya needs all of us. We cannot build the country if even one single community is left behind,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what our Constitution stands for and we are implementing fully to ensure no community or individual is left behind in our march to development.&ldquo;God put us together for us to enjoy, learn and benefit from our diversity for our mutual progress and prosperity.&rdquo;
