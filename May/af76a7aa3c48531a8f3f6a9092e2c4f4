Kiambu Governor William Kabogo (pictured) yesterday said he will vie as an independent candidate in August.He lost to Kabete MP Ferdinand Waititu in the Jubilee primaries last month.Kabogo garnered 69,916 votes, against Waititu&rsquo;s 353,604.&ldquo;Having consulted my wife, I hereby announce my independent candidature... At the end of the day, we are one people with the same dream,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;.. this is not my fight. It is our fight. It is not about who is stronger at spreading propaganda, but about the vision that will take us where we need to be.&rdquo;Kabogo said power is given by the people and he is ready to make Kiambu a better county. &ldquo;For those who had little faith, I want to promise everyone that I will give you the best, whether you are a Kikuyu or a Luo or from any other tribe.&rdquo; Kabogo said the nominations were flawed and he is ready to face all hurdles ahead of the General Election. &ldquo;The election had many flaws ... we have evidence there was rigging,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My silence was a result of the peace pact that I signed. The younger Kabogo would have handled things differently.&rdquo; Kabogo claimed there are people who had hurt his family, but noted he will not give up. &ldquo;There are a lot of things said about me, but those who want to seek the truth will find it. Some of them have hurt me and my family, but we are strong,&rdquo; he said.
