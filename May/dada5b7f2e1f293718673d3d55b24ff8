The Political Parties Disputes Tribunal has ordered a repeat of primaries in one polling station at Ainabkoi constituency. This will be to determine the Jubilee aspirant between current MP Samuel Chepkonga and William Chepkut. The fresh poll will only be done at Munyaka polling station in Uasin Gishu county within the next 48 hours. Protests erupted in Eldoret on Tuesday after it emerged that Jubilee was planning to repeat the primaries at the said station.

We will go for the repeat," Chepkut, former Nicholas Biwott's aide, told the Star on Thursday. The development has sparked off tension between Chepkut and Chepkonga's supporters. Only about 120 votes cost the incumbent the ticket to defend the seat during the August polls. The incumbent filed a complaint at the Jubilee Appeals Tribunal which then ruled in his favour. Chepkonga, Constitutional and Legal Affairs committee, garnered 13,556 votes against Chepkut's 13,685. Several aspirants in the North Rift, who lost in the jubilee primaries, are contemplating vying as independent candidates.
