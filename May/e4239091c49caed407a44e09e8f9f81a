It is not a guarantee Kalonzo Musyoka will succeed Raila Odinga in 2022 if NASA wins the August 8 election, Lugari MP Ayub Savula has said.Speaking on a talk show on Citizen TV on Monday evening, Savula said the NASA coalition agreement does not indicate Kalonzo will automatically take over from Raila, after serving his one term.He said the Wiper leader and ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi, the brains behind the alliance, will go to the nominations if NASA remains intact. And if they go to the nominations, he said, Musalia will emerge the winner based on the Luhya numbers. According to the IEBC records, the Western region registered 1,375,220 voters in the last mass voter registration compared to Lower Eastern&rsquo;s &mdash; Kitui, Machakos and Makueni counties &mdash; 1,067,990.Wiper had in March threatened to bolt from NASA if its boss Kalonzo was declared the opposition presidential candidate. &ldquo;If it is not Kalonzo, that will be the end of NASA,&rdquo; National Assembly minority leader Francis Nyenze said.&ldquo;It [NASA] could change into something like Nyanza Super Alliance because we will pull out,&rdquo; he told reporters at Parliament Buildings. This also comes against a fierce battle for influence and position in anticipation of a NASA government within Wiper, which threatens to create hostilities within NASA.
