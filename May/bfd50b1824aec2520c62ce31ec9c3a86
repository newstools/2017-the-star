The Ministry of Health and USAid may this week reach an agreement to unlock the Sh2.1 billion funding suspended last week.Health CS Cleopa Mailu said they have been holding meetings daily to strengthen the accounting systems, and comply with the donor requirements.&ldquo;After today&rsquo;s meeting, I believe we will reach a point where our partner, the US government, will be able to make a pronouncement,&rdquo; he said yesterday. &ldquo;We need by the end of this week, if not earlier, to reach an understanding.&rdquo;Mailu said there is need to overhaul the ministry&rsquo;s procurement process because it is a key concern for the funding partner.He said the procedures have undermined government&rsquo;s operations, but it will take time to effect new changes. &ldquo;Systems do not get overhauled overnight, it takes time. Therefore what we are doing is not going to be done overnight. And it&rsquo;s on that understanding of what is being done which we have to get to, and if they are comfortable with that understanding to rescind their decision, but I leave that to them,&rdquo; he said.Mailu spoke at Afya House when he flagged off drugs valued at Sh265 million donated to mission hospitals by the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority.US Ambassador Robert Godec said USAid suspended the Sh2.1 billon due to concerns about corruption and weak accounting procedures.He said the move was intended to ensure &ldquo;health care spending reaches those in need, and to protect US taxpayer money&rdquo;.Godec said they are working with the ministry to improve accounting and promised to restore funding if changes are made.Mailu yesterday said they are working on the changes.&ldquo;That we have been doing but it&rsquo;s not complete. There have been concerns to ensure that process is complete to give them assurances; so we have been doing that,&rdquo; he said.The CS said the ministry has also complied with requirements of the US Centre for Diseases Control. The CDC has since unlocked their funding.&ldquo;We get support through CDC for certain programmes... By Friday, we documented one of the aspects and agreed with CDC. And from that point we are able to draw funds &ndash; the ones which we were saying had stopped &ndash; because we have complied,&rdquo; the CS said.
