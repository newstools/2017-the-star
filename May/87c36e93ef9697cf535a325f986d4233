A committee member of Laikipia Farmers Association has urged the national government to carry out full-scale disarmament of pastoralists to restore peace permanently in the county.John Elias sits in the committee that brings together 58 ranchers in Laikipia county.He said pushing armed pastoralists out of the county is not a lasting solution to the problem. Towards the end of last year, security agents backed by the Kenya Defence Forces drove out illegal herders from Baringo who invaded Laikipia and Isiolo counties. However, security chiefs are tight-lipped on the number of illegal guns recovered.Elias, who is also a director at Ol Lentile Trust, said the government needs to do more to restore confidence among the ranchers who contribute significantly to the growth of the economy.
