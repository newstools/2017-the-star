Elgeyo Marakwet Deputy Governor Gabriel Lamaon has confirmed he has been dropped as Governor Alex Tolgos’s running mate. Wesley Rotich, 28, will be Tolgos’s running mate following the decision approved by the governor’s close advisers. Tolgos (pictured) chaired a meeting with his executives in Iten town, where he said he is yet to make the announcement formally. Winning Keiyo votes were one reason for choosing Rotich. Dr Lamaon confirmed he had been dropped and said it is the governor’s right to pick anyone. “I will ensure the governor is reelected,” he said. The Deputy Governor said he is grateful for having been given a chance to serve the governor. “He gave me a chance to serve as the first deputy governor of our county, and I still believe he is the best governor.”
