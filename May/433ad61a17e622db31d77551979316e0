Wiper has defended the nomination of party leader Kalonzo Musyoka's eldest son to the EALA , saying he is qualified.Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana, who addressed journalists on behalf of the party on Thursday, said due process was followed in Kennedy Musyoka's nomination."He was the best candidate among the eight who applied. Five came for the interview," he said.Kibwana further said Kennedy is an intelligent leader with proven abilities to represent the country. "We cannot overlook someone's constitutional rights and yet he is qualified."The Governor said the interviews tested applicants' knowledge of the activities of the East African Community activities and the East African Legislative Assembly.A storm erupted in Wiper and ODM after both parties, which belong to the National Super Alliance, nominated Kennedy and Raila's brother Oburu Oginga (Nominated MP) for the EALA slot.On Monday, Oginga said he decided to forego the slot to campaign for Raila, who is the Opposition's presidential candidate. Kalonzo is his running mate."People are focusing on a non-issue...I declined the move after realising more than three people applied. That is being spun to look like a favour because I am related to Raila," he said."I am just as qualified as any other person but I cannot focus on EALA as well as the presidential campaigns. That is why I declined the nomination."More on this: Storm in NASA as Kalonzo son, Oburu nominated to EALAAlso read: I declined EALA slot to campaign for Raila, says Oburu
