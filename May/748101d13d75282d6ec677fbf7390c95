Nurses in Nyeri have refused to call off their strike despite receiving &ldquo;Show Cause letters&rdquo; . Kenya National Union of Nurses Nyeri chairperson Ann Nyawira said the boycott, which entered its fourth week yesterday is still on, adding they will not be cowed by the county administration. &ldquo;All of us have received &lsquo;Show Cause Letters&rsquo; from the government, but no amount of intimidation will move us. We shall stay put until our demands of promotion and hiring of more nurses are met,&rdquo; Nyawira said.On Friday, Nyeri Health executive Charles Githinji said they have met all the nurses&rsquo; demands, and gave them up to Friday morning to report to work or be sacked. Shortly after, it handed out letters to explain why disciplinary action should not be taken against them for absconding duty. Githinji coud not be reached for comment.
