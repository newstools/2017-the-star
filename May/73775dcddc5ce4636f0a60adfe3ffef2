Kenyan graduates do not meet job market requirements due to a disconnect between their training and what the jobs require, University of Embu acting VC has said. Corporates and other organisations should have internship programmes to train university students so they can meet job market requirements when they graduate, Prof Daniel Mugendi said on Wednesday. He spoke yesterday after the signing of a partnership agreement between the university and Cytonn Investment, an investments and real estate company with offices in Nairobi and the US. The company will offer internships to the best students from Embu University. Cytonn CEO Edwin Dande said the students will join its Young Leaders Programme.
