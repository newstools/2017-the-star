Deputy President William Ruto yesterday wound up his two-day tour of Western Kenya.He said the opposition leaders are only keen on removing Jubilee from power, yet they have not told Kenyans their development agenda.&ldquo;If you ask the opposition leaders to tell us their agenda for Kenyans, they say they are only interested in removing Jubilee from power and that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; Ruto said.&ldquo;This is why I ask the people of Western Kenya to make a wise decision and not gamble with their votes.&rdquo; The DP spoke at the Misiku and Kamukuywa trading centres in Bungoma county.Ruto told the opposition to stop misleading Kenyans on Jubilee&rsquo;s development projects.He said opposition leaders have been criticising Jubilee&rsquo;s development track record, but they have nothing to show for the time they served in previous regimes. &ldquo;Our friends in the Opposition are making unnecessary noise about Jubilee,&rdquo; Ruto said.The DP said Jubilee has spent a lot of money towards the revival of the Webuye Pan Paper Mills and the Mumias Sugar Company.Water CS Eugene Wamalwa, Bungoma Governor Kenneth Lusaka, MPs John Waluke (Sirisia), Dan Wanyama (Webuye West), Lazarus Wafula (Saboti) and Boniface Otsiula (Bumula) were present. Others were woman representatives Reginalda Wanyonyi (Bungoma), Rachel Shebesh (Nairobi) and Janet Nangabo (Trans Nzoia).Ruto also said the party is democratic and accommodates all Kenyans, irrespective of their social status. &ldquo;For example, the people have elected a watchman, a street boy and a cook and we congratulate them on their nominations,&rdquo; he said. Lusaka said voters in the region support Jubilee, because of its commitment to address challenges faced by residents.
