Independent candidates should focus on campaigning for seats instead of wasting time lying to Kenyans they were rigged out during party primaries, JP Kinangop MP nominee Kwenya Thuku has said.He said there were no irregularities during the Jubilee Party primaries. Thuku yesterday said some independents are trying to incite voters as they seek sympathy votes.&ldquo;I want to disagree with voices claiming there was rigging during nominations. That is not true,&rdquo; he said at Njabini, Kinangop.Thuku said leaders should learn to tell the truth. He urged the independent candidates in Nyandarua to engage in issue-based politics and not use propaganda.Thuku said it is the democratic right of voters to elect leaders of their choice.He defeated seven rivals to become the JP nominee. Other politicians who sought the ticket include Stephen Kinyanjui, Simon Kagiri and Chege Mugo.Mugo has since resigned as a JP member to contest as an independent candidate. Thuku said he is not afraid of independents. &ldquo;I know the people of Kinangop will confirm me as their MP,&rdquo; he said.
