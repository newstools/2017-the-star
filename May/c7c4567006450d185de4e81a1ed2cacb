Willis Okeyo was on target as he made his debut for his Club Bad Kreuznach in their 2-1 win over visiting TG Worms in the ongoing Germany League last Sunday at the Salinental stadium.Okeyo, who left the country last week after landing a 3-month training stint courtesy of an exchange program, scored the winning goal in 45th minute after both teams had tied 1-1 in the first half. Johannes Nagel had put the visitors in the lead in the 18th minute before Schmidt T&ouml;ppich scored in the 29th for the hosts.Okeyo, who turns up for the former Kenya Hockey Union men&rsquo;s premier league champions, Kenya Police, said he is happy to have made a debut with a goal.He noted: &ldquo;Every player wants to make a positive impression at a new club whether through an assist or scoring and I&rsquo;am glad that mine was through a goal and that gives me morale and confidence going forward. It is winter here but for me, its one day at a time. The food ranges from pasta, beef and rice and as much as I would love to have something else, there is no option and so I am careful on the quantity,&rdquo;He continued: &ldquo;The language is also an issue but we have an interpreter, who makes it easy for me to understand what our coach, Christian Winkler, is saying whether during training or in the game altogether.&rdquo;Okeyo observed things are completely different there as far as the sport is concerned. He said, &ldquo;The age group categories here are given the same seriousness as the top flight . And so when the player comes of age he or she is well oiled and knows what to do and how. That is why the standards high are compared to the Africa.&rdquo;
