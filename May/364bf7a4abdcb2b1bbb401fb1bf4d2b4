Mathira MP aspirant Rigathi Gachagua has criticised his closest challenger in the Jubilee primaries for refusing to accept defeat.He said the nominations were fair and transparent and accused Wambura wa Maranga of making fake ballot papers to find reason to lodge complaints. Gachagua said Maranga is trying to make a case to have a reason to ditch JP.&ldquo;She was all over with fake ballot papers in a futile attempt to suggest that there was foul play,&rdquo; he said on Sunday in the Miiri Catholic Church grounds, Mathira.Gachagua urged losers to &ldquo;accept and move on&rdquo; or run as independents, instead of taking winners in circles through unnecessary appeals. He said the same voters who participated in the primaries will still decide the losers&rsquo; fate.&ldquo;We find the whole thing a circus and waste of time. We would like to focus on mobilising presidential votes. We don&rsquo;t want to waste time arguing about what happened. The voice of the people was very clear and very loud,&rdquo; he said.He urged the JP national secretariat to issue winners with nomination certificates.
