A 37-year-old man accused of marrying a school girl has been sentenced to 15 years in jail.Stephen Okonda was convicted by Makadara senior resident magistrate William Oketch after the court found him guilty of the defiling a 16-year- old girl in 2014.According to court papers, Okonda committed the offence between January 6 and February 14, 2014, in Njiru area. In the alternative charge, Okonda was accused of committing indecent act with a child.While testifying, the girl told the court she was a form four student when she met the suspect and lived with him in the same area.She narrated how she was at home in Khwisero in January 2013 when her mother called her, asking her to return to Nairobi.Okonda lived in an adjacent flat and he is alleged to have tried to seduce the minor&rsquo;s sister and her cousin, but both rejected his advances.He then settled on the complainant.It is alleged due to financial hardships in the two families, Okonda and the girl decided to move in together and split rent.But Okonda is reported to have continued seducing the student, saying he loved her and that he would marry her.He used to give her Sh200 or Sh300 to buy stuff that pleased her. But Okonda started having sex with the minor when family members were away. &ldquo;The accused opened his door at around 12am and would come to the sitting room and signal her. PW1[prosecution witness one] would go to his room and stay until 3am having sex,&rdquo; reads the judgment in part.&ldquo;This went on for four days until the wife of the accused came back. At some point the minor quarrelled with her mother who was accusing her of having an affair with the accused.&rdquo;While being cross examined, the minor said she was not lying.She said she didn&rsquo;t tell anyone because Okonda warned her against it, and because he had promised to marry her and gave her money.In his mitigation, the suspect claimed he knew the minor. Okonda said he and the girl&rsquo;s parents were friends, and he was not capable of committing the offence.Okonda said the girl was like a daughter to him.&ldquo;With certainty, the court reaches a finding that the totality of the evidence supports the charges and that the prosecution has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt.Consequently, the court convicts the accused of defilement,&rdquo; the trial magistrate said.In July 2015, a Nakuru court heard a case in which a teacher at Njoro Girls&rsquo; High School was accused of defiling and sexually assaulting seven of his students.The Kiswahili teacher allegedly defiled one of his students and sexually abused six others.
