This time, in fact, we are going to support him fully,&rdquo; he said on Saturday at a meeting in Bomet.He was defending his move to support Raila and NASA.&ldquo;Kalenjins voted for Odinga in 2007 and there is no problem if we vote for him once again this round in fact we are going to support him fully no one should try and convince us further as to why we are supporting him,&rdquo; Rutto said.He expressed optimism that with Odinga being NASA&rsquo;s flag bearer they were assured of winning the seat and send the Jubilee administration home come August 8.Rutto said he is optimistic that NASA will win the election and send the Jubilee administration home on August 8.&ldquo;As principals in the coalition we all settled on Raila as our candidate because of his age and he will lead us for one term before other co-principals have it on a rotational basis,&rdquo; he said.Rutto urged the IEBC to ensure the general election is free and fair."IEBC must assure us that the election process is free&hellip;we do not want to hear these claims of rigging since Kenyans are eagerly waiting and they expect nothing but results that reflect their will,&rdquo; he added.
