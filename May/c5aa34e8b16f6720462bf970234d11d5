It is good to hear that IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati and his team have ticked all the boxes and are ready to manage the General Election. However, preparedness for Election Day goes far beyond the managers. It involves all participants, from the voters to incumbents and aspirants to the parties and all arms of government. The history of elections in Kenya has been one of too many losers who donâ€™t accept they have lost legitimately, beginning with the party nominations and all the way to the apex poll, the presidential race. The primaries are over and the main event is 97 days down the road and already there has been an element of violence. Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet and his commanders must nip violence in the bud throughout the process and the country. They need to ensure the police are deployed in enough and well-equipped numbers and there is no use of excessive force. Kenyans should make this their most exemplary election yet.
