Nyandarua JP nominee for senator position Githiomi Mwangi has criticised Nyandarua woman representative Wanjiku Muhia for insulting governor nominee Francis Kimemia.During a dispute pitting Muhia against woman representative nominee Faith Gitau, Kimemia led Githiomi and JP nominees for MP positions in declaring their support for Gitau. This did not go well with Muhia. On Monday last week, Muhia went to Kipipiri where she has a near-fanatical following. She led her supporters in condemning Kimemia for interfering with the woman representative contest. The media showed Muhia surrounded by supporters, some waving bras, where she said she will buy underwear and skirts for Kimemia if he wants to be a contestant in the women race. Githiomi has said the insult was uncalled for. Yesterday Muhia said, &ldquo;Tell Githiomi to mind his own business and focus on what he shall do for Nyandarua.&rdquo;
