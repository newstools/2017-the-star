Kajiado NASA leaders yesterday expressed concern that the proposed Wildlife Conservation and Management (Amendment) Bill, 2017 could be aimed at suppressing pastoral communities.They said the proposed fines to be meted out on herders trespassing into conservation areas under Clause 31 of Section 102 are demeaning to pastoralists.The Bill is sponsored by MP Amina Abdalla. It was handed to Parliament on April 11 and seeks to raise fines for trespass into national parks to a minimum of Sh10 million.The leaders included Governor David Nkedianye, ODM senator nominee Daniel Tenaai and Thomas Lekenya. They said in Loitokitok that they are opposed to the amendment, which will segregate their communities.Tenaai said communities in pastoral areas in the country have not been engaged as demanded by the Constitution, hence, &ldquo;any attempt to pass the Bill without further amendments is a recipe for chaos&rdquo;.Clause 31 amends Section 102 of the Act to insert all categories of protected areas into which unauthorised access is prohibited. It imposes a maximum penalty for violation of the restrictions.The clause makes the owner of livestock liable for the offence of an employee, agent or servant entering a protected wildlife area with livestock and without a permit from the the Kenya Wildlife Service. The leaders spoke after receiving defectors from Jubilee. They said they are not opposed to the entire amendment, but want the government to be sensitive to pastoralists.Tenaai said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve lived with wildlife and shared resources with wild animals for decades. We&rsquo;ve never protested against them sharing our grazing fields with our livestock. Why is the state introducing laws that will put us at loggerheads with wild animals?&rdquo;
