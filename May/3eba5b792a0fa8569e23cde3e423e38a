Some elders in Ainamoi constituency are lobbying for MP Benjamin Langat (pictured) to defend his post as an independent candidate.The MP lost in the Kericho governor Jubilee Party nominations.Newcomer Silvanus Maritim won the JP nominations for MP last week, but some residents have expressed fears that the former employee of Safaricom could be an absentee leader if elected.&ldquo;We want a leader who frequents home and not one who would settle in Nairobi for the rest of his lifetime the moment he or she is elected. We suspect Maritim may be an absentee leader,&rdquo; resident Paul Langat said on Monday. He said Maritim made a technical appearance in Ainamoi during the primaries to land the party ticket.&ldquo;Outgoing MP Benjamin Langat made political mistakes by going for the gubernatorial seat nomination race before consulting the elders in Ainamoi. Let him come and talk to us and let&rsquo;s see whether we will help him retain the seat as an independent candidate,&rdquo; Langat said.Supporters of losers in the JP nominations are said to have planned to back the former MP to retain the seat.Some of the losers include Kericho Knut secretary Stanley Mutai, former Kericho Teachers Training College principal Harry Langat and David Kikwai.During the nominations, Maritim won by 11,125 votes followed by Mutai (9,470 votes), Kikwai (3,097 votes), Ann Too (2,789 votes), Harry Langat (2,931 votes), Isaac Bosuben (1,733 votes) and Dominic Too (570 votes).In Belgut constituency, MP Eric Keter is likely to run as an independent candidate after being locked out of the nomination. His name was missing in the list of voters in Belgut.The nomination was won by Nelson Koech, who lost to Keter in the 2013 general election.
