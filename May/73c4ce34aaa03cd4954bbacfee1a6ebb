Migori youths painted shades at Posta grounds red for Jubilee Party in a demonstration against the awarding of the ODM certificate to Governor Okoth Obado.The demonstrators said the decision by the National Elections Board, as communicated by ODM communications director Philip Etale, amounted to support for Jubilee.They wanted the certificate issued to Obado's main rival Ochillo Ayacko, former Sony Sugar MD Paul Odola or Nyatike businesswoman Anne Anyanga.Ayacko has resigned from party and declared he will vie as an independent candidate.More on this: Ayacko quits ODM, to vie in Migori as independent candidateAlso read: Obado clinches Migori ODM primaries, floors AyackoProtester Timothy Odhiambo said: &ldquo;We will never allow some people to sit in Nairobi and dictate the will of Migori residents. The orange lost seats and votes in Migori after shambolic nominations."He added that they will advocate for voter apathy or push for a Jubilee candidate to hurt Raila's chances of becoming president.Regarding the location, boda boda rider Jack Otieno said: &ldquo;This is the same venue where our deputy party leader Hassan Joho's bodyguard was shot in the leg after chaos caused by the Governor. We need the decision changed."Obado denied the claims but the party's disciplinary committee imposed a Sh2 million on him and asked him to send leader Raila Odinga a written apology.More on this: ODM fines Obado, Ongoro Sh3 million, demands apologies after chaos at party eventsAlso see: Joho bodyguard shot during chaotic ODM rally in MigoriThe youths also wrote pro-Jubilee messages on the shades and called for residents to vote for President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto.They further chanted slogans against Raila&rsquo;s wife Ida, accusing her of behind "forcing Obado as the ODM ticket holder".The Governor's supporters earlier held demonstrations celebrating the decision which has divided the county into two ahead of the deadline for naming nominees.Last Tuesday, ODM returning officer Samuel Olala announced Obado as the winner of the primaries but Ayacko was also named winner about an hour later by county election board chairman Tom Otike.In a statement on May 1, Etale said the determination by NEB chairperson Judith Pareno was based on a report by a three-man team sent to the county to investigate the nominations."Pareno says the report recommended the upholding of the returning officer's initial results," he said.But aides of four governor aspirants, including Odola and Omodho, refused to comment on the statement saying it was not official.On Tuesday afternoon, sources at Orange House hinted at a consensus for selecting one of the four as the deputy governor candidate to prevent a fallout.The statement also declared Suna West MP aspirant Joseph Ndiege a winner. The gun drama that ensued over the winner for this post forced returning officer Ochiel Obino to seek refuge at Migori police station.In a report seen by the Star, Obino says there was a car chase and that three shots were fired at his car and in the air before he got to the station.He says he was rescued by a policewoman who told him to hide under her desk as the chaos extended to the premises. This was after Suna West MP Joseph Ndiege and former Migori mayor and aspirant Peter Masara clashed.Obino further says he declared third aspirant Philip Mwabe winner and offered him the nomination certificate.Etale also noted that ODM reversed an earlier decision to give a nomination certificate to trade union leader Tom Odege as the candidate for Nyatike MP. Fredrick Ogenga was declared the winner.Nyatike MP Edick Anyanga and his wife Anne wee locked out. Anyanga, Masara and Mwabe said they will later issue comprehensive statements on their next moves.Rongo MP Dalmas Otieno and Awendo MP Jared Kopiyo, who lost the primaries to Paul Abuor and Walter Owino respectively, said they will address the press on the directions they will take.
