Mandera East MP Abdulaziz Farah has withdrawn his reelection bid, citing frustration from a negotiated democracy pact by the Garre Council of Elders.He said endorsing candidates suppresses good leadership.Farah spoke on Tuesday in Mandera town, when he donated two school buses, four motorcycles and one Land Cruiser. He was to run on the Jubilee ticket.&ldquo;The negotiated democracy caused a lot of mix-up and confusion among the people,&rdquo; the MP said. &ldquo;Almost every candidate feels shortchanged by the elders.&rdquo;Farah said he is disappointed, but is keen to ensure clan politics does not divide Mandera. He hopes the elders might consider him in future for his obedience.Meanwhile, Mandera Governor Ali Roba has said the Economic Frontier Party leaders&rsquo; move to support Jubilee is hypocritical. He said the leaders want sympathy support from the people.Roba called for unity. &ldquo;Politics will come and go, but your role as a leader should be to unite the people, not divide them. We should be happy when a husband and wife do not support the same person, but live together peacefully,&rdquo; he said.
