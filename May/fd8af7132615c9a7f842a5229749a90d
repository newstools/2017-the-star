Youth in Meru have threatened to take over the Jubilee campaign for President Uhuru Kenyatta if the ongoing rivalry between Senator Kiraitu Murungi and Governor Peter Munya continues.Mount Kenya Caucus youth group chairman Linford Mutembei said the rivalry between the duo is not good for Uhuru&rsquo;s reelection bid.&ldquo;We want Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto to come in person to ask for votes because supporters of the two politicians support them,&rdquo; Mutembei said. Uhuru may lose votes if he takes sides in the rivalry, he added. Mutembei spoke to journalists in Nkubu town, South Imenti, where he met a delegation of youths. He said successful Jubilee campaigns in Meru must involve youth, religious groups and professionals.
