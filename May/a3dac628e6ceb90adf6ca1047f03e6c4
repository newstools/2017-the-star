An amazing second half comeback saw debutants Kariobangi Sharks beat former champions Mathare United 2-1 in a Sportpesa Premier League match yesterday. Mathare took the lead after 26 minutes through Crispinus Oduor, one which they held onto until halftime.Sharks though fought back through left back Bolton Omwenga and Masoud Juma to consign the Slum Boys to a second consecutive defeat since the heady victory over Gor Mahua nine days earlier.The win now sees Sharks leap an eye watering six places to third in the table with sixteen points, five shy of the top slot occupied byPosta Rangers while Mathare&rsquo;s championship hopes, even this early in the campaign, look a long shot as they are down in 14th with nine points three shy of bottom spot.Mathare had coach Francis Kimanzi back in the dugout after a seven-match ban by the Kenyan Premier League Independent Disputes and Appeals Committee cut short bringing comfort to his players with his assuring calm demeanor on the technical bench.Sharks, however, had them in the back foot for most of the opening exchanges match and nearly welcomed him with bad news but defender Pascal Ogweno&rsquo;s effort was ruled offside.That reprieve was a wake up call to Mathare and they duly took advantage with Oduor putting them ahead just halfway past the opening period. Sharks, however, fought back gamely in the final period with Omwenga drawing them level in the 67th minute before Juma completed the turnaround 10 minutes later.Kimanzi threw in Harrison Mwendwa, David owino and Ronald Okoth but the damage had already been done as new-comers Sharks claimed all three points.Today, fellow promoted outfit Nzoia United make a trip down south to face Bandari. The dockers will be in high spirits after picking up their first win in the narrow lone goal victory over Mathare last time out. The return of four points has seen Paul Nkata&rsquo;s men return among the championship dark horses. Three points against Nzoia will further enhance their credentials as potential champions. For the last couple of seasons, Thika United have flirted with relegation, escaping by the skin of their teeth each time. Now sitting uncomfortably in 17th place, those fears have been rekindled again.Today, they will be away at debutants Nakumatt seeking a much needed win that would render thoughts of a potential relegation dogfight misplaced.
