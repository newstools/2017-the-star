These included Early Childhood Development Centres, Huduma centres, creation of employment for youths and roads projects.He also mentioned the upgrading of two hospitals in each county to referral level, bringing specialised medical services nearer to the people, and the issuance of more than 2.5 million title deeds.Other initiatives Uhuru mentioned were electricity supply, the construction of the Standard Gauge Railway and the improvement of school infrastructure at a cost of Sh5 billion to ensure 100 per cent transition from primary to secondary. He said he will work day and night to transform the country so that "by the end of five years we will be talking about Vision 2020, not Vision 2030".'OPPOSITION DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO SOLVE PROBLEMS'The President dismissed the Opposition as unfocused and lacking vision, and likened it to &ldquo;a man who does not know how to solve problems but only knows how to talk about problems&rdquo;.Regarding the high prices of basic products milk, maize flour and sugar, he said he was well aware that the people were suffering.Uhuru said he has been quiet about the matter because his team is working on solutions and that Parliament will be recalled soon to come up with legislations on the issue of food prices."Msituletee (loosely translated to 'don't bother us')," he told Raila and others in the Opposition, saying once again that they were top leaders in the past regime yet did not steer development or solve the people's problems.He said they should have tackled the problem of unga prices then instead of waiting until now to tear into his administration."Our objective is bigger than those of our competitors whose only aim is to get jobs for four guys."More on this: Worry about prices of Unga and milk not defeating Raila, KOT tell UhuruAlso read: KOT roast DP Ruto over high cost of livingPresident Uhuru Kenyatta speaks during Jubilee Party's National Delegates Convention at Bomas of Kenya in Nairobi, May 6, 2017. /CHARLES KIMANIUhuru asked all leaders in the ruling coalition to campaign together to ensure they win.

They mainly spoke of development and accused Raila of engaging in politics of division.National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale asked Raila's ODM party to stop using divisive tactics as its campaign strategy."Jubilee has shown it is a national outfit with all stakeholders on board. We are forming a team that will win the rematch from what they gave us in 2013. They have given ss a team that we will beat in August," he stated."In 2013 we had the baggage of the ICC and were not in government. This time, all that is in the past and we are going to prove that this race is for the swift."Duale further accused the Opposition of having plans to set up a tallying centre in Tanzania to hack the IEBC and fake a win."We are aware of their evil plans but we will form teams to guard our votes because we will not let them lie to Kenyans when they know they have no numbers," he said.Jubilee secretary general Raphael Tuju said candidates who won the primaries will be issued with their certificates at the party's Kasarani headquarters in Nairobi from next Tuesday to Thursday.But the Political Parties Disputes Tribunal nullified the party's nominations for Mombasa and said certificates should not be issues until concerns byPatrick Kabundu, who is county secretary and a member of the County Executive Committee, are addressed.Read more: Tribunal cancels Jubilee's Mombasa primaries, wants new elections boardTuju also spoke of democracy in the party, saying those who won the primaries are from many parts of Kenya.
