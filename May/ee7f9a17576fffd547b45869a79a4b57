Borrowers are now allowed to use items such as machinery, furniture, vehicles among others as collateral in securing loans after President Uhuru Kenyatta signed into law the Movable Property Security Rights Bill 2017 yesterday.The new law is aimed at widening the scope of business and entrepreneurship in the country by enhancing access to credit by micro, small and medium business owners who have been unable to provide fixed assets as security against credit facilities.It also provides for the establishment of the office of the Registrar of Security Rights, which will facilitate the registration of security rights in movable property. This will provide a system that can be used by lenders, businesses and other practitioners in increasing secured transactions, access to credit and other forms of finance.Deloitte&rsquo;s Kenya Economic Outlook 2017 report released in February 2017 shows that there has been a 23 per cent decrease in average lending rates following the Banking (Amendment) Act, 2016 which came into force on 14 September 2016.The report shows that the hardest hit by the interest rate capping has been the private sector which is dominated by the micro and small enterprises as commercial banks opt to lend to the government.
