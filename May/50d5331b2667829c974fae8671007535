Dagoretti South MP Dennis Waweru has dismissed as untrue reports that he is among a group of politicians from Central Kenya plotting a revolt against DP William Ruto.Waweru said he is not aware of the existence of any political group which is hell bent to frustrate Ruto in Central Kenya. &ldquo;I can only term the statements as propaganda manufactured by my political detractors who are out to poison the good relationship I have with the Deputy President,&rdquo; he said at a press conference at Parliament Buildings. The Chairman for the Central Kenya MPs&rsquo; caucus said the reports are unfounded and based on malice.&ldquo;For avoidance of any doubt I am a staunch supporter of the Deputy President and our relationship is both personal and political,&rdquo; Waweru said. The MP was responding to reports on social media that he is among MPs from Central Kenya planning a rebellion against Ruto&rsquo;s 2022 presidential bid.President Uhuru Kenyatta has committed to hand over the mantle to Ruto in 2022 after serving a second term, if he wins the August 8 General Election. The net effect is that Uhuru is expected to transfer his Central Kenya political bastion to Ruto as a return of favour to the Rift Valley vote bloc, which backed the President in 2013 and now in the next elections. However, the downfall of several influential political bigwigs from Central Kenya during the Jubilee primaries has drawn the DP into the fray. Some accused him of funding their opponents. &ldquo;Jubilee primaries are now water under the bridge,&rdquo; Waweru said.
