Smartphones manufacturers are now bringing in devices that are top quality but befit their market in terms of pricing.According to research done by Jumia Kenya dubbed the White Paper, as we move towards a more digital economy, we find that the Kenyan consumer is becoming more sophisticated, with Kenya leading the Africa Internet penetration with 67 per cent of the population in Kenya being classified as Internet users.The report continues to cite that -the competitive landscape in the smartphone industry has shifted over the last five years as Chinese brands dominate and drive the democratisation of smartphones (The &ldquo;Chinese Brand Era&rdquo;).Take a close look at the Huawei GR5 2017.The phone uses dual-camera technology to make taking the great photos faster and easier.The use of two cameras gives fine control over the photo taking process, giving an artistic volume to your shots.The dual camera setup includes a 12MP and a 2MP rear camera for the Bokeh effect.This is supposedly for depth of field.The 1.25 large pixel option helps the user to achieve a cleaner shot with more clarity for photos that would be captured in the night.The rear camera can also autofocus in just 0.3 seconds and provide a dynamic depth of field.Sporting a 5.5-inch Full HDscreen, the phone is clearly a phablet. Most consumers in their youths prefer a wider view on their screens so as to be able to probably watch movies and also play games on their phones.Mobile subscription penetration is at 82% driven by a continuing favorable landscape of the smartphone industry brought on by increased competition with current players and new players entering into the market.With dual NanoSIM support and full LTE (4G) support, the GR5 2017 will attend to all your networking needs. This means that you do have to undergo all the bulk of having to carry two phones around which is a bulky task.In terms of storage, the GR5 2017 comes either with 32GB or 64GB of onboard storage that can be expanded upto an additional 128GB through the second SIM tray.Fingerprint sensors are also now the in-thing with mobile devices currently. The device spots a third generation fingerprint sensor located just below the camera towards the middle of the phone. It makes unlocking the phone quite easy. Total time for this: a little over a second. Yes it is that fast.Powered by a non-removable 3,340mAh battery, my powerbank has for some time now been rendered useless as the battery takes you for almost 14 hours on maximum usage without having to charge your phone time and time again. Located at the bottom of the device, you will find the MicroUSB port for charging and data transfer and also dual downward flaring speakers for sound.However, the manufacturers need to upgrade the display in the incoming upgrades that will enhance it&rsquo;s beauty on the eyes and also probably increase the megapixels in the front camera.The device is actually great for photogenic people who want to take photos at a reasonable price. At a cost of SH 26,000 you will get the device at accredited mobile outlets around the country.The Huawei P10 is the company&rsquo;s next device and already on pre-order. It will retail at SH 64,999 and the first 100 customers are set to get free tablets worth SH 12,999.
