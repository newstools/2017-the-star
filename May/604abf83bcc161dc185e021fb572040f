The Nairobi government will spend Sh180 million more every month, or Sh2.16 billion more per year, on its 12,729 employees.This follows the signing of a collective bargaining agreement with the workers&rsquo; union, giving them a 15 per cent pay rise from July 1.The CBA was signed by the Kenya County Government Workers&rsquo; Union secretary general Roba Duba, county Public Service Board chairman Philip Kungu and the Federation of Kenya Employers at Charter Hall on Friday.Governor Evans Kidero said the pay increase will cushion the workers against the rising cost of living.&ldquo;Inflation is seven-and-a-half per cent per year. Over the last four years, they have not received [a] pay rise, meaning that they are earning 40 per cent less than what they are supposed to,&rdquo; he said.Kidero has on many occasions complained about the ballooning wage bill, and blamed it on the slow pace of development.The wage bill stands at Sh1.25 billion per month or Sh15 billion year. This will now swell to Sh1.43 billion per month or Sh17.16 billion per year.Kidero said rising inflation, slow economic growth and adverse weather conditions have greatly affected most of the staff, reducing their productivity.&ldquo;Some of them are unable to satisfactorily fend for their families and serve our residents as expected of them,&rdquo; he said. Roba said workers have not received a pay rise since 2012, despite the high cost of living.&ldquo;This CBA was voluntarily negotiated in accordance with employment law and labour relations. It contains improvement and better interpretation of the old CBAs to contextualise in terms of the devolved system,&rdquo; he said. County secretary Robert Ayisi said the CBA is a &ldquo;full package&rdquo; that comes with increases in basic salary, allowance and better health cover.
