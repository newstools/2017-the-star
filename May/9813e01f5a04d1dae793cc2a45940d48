Unlike the rest of Kenya where women are confronting men head on in the race for political seats, women in Lamu seem to have shied away completely.Many blame their culture and a &lsquo;chauvenistic society&rsquo;.But against all odds, a few women have tossed their hats in the ring to vie for the Lamu woman representative seat while keeping off other seats. No woman has joined the governor and Senate races. The MP, woman representative and MCA seats in Lamu have attracted more than 100 candidates, out of which only 15 are women. The issue of women participation in politics has been a thorny one, especially at the Coast and specifically in Lamu, where the culture doesn&rsquo;t seem to support women who seek office.Aisha Nizar, who is vying for the Lamu woman representative seat on the ODM ticket, yesterday said the Lamu community is yet to believe a woman can lead. She said despite putting her best foot forward to campaign, the &ldquo;rigid&rdquo; Swahili culture holds her and other women candidates back. &ldquo;When we call meetings, the turnout is pathetic compared to that of our male counterparts.The men have also been very mean and always find ways to throw nasty jabs whenever they can and it can be very demoralising, but we have to try,&rdquo;Nizar said.Maryam Abubakar who is also vying for the woman representative seat on the Maendeleo Chap Chap ticket, said men overtly insult women whenever they try and sell their manifestos. &ldquo;We are told to go back home,&rdquo; she said.Incumbent Shakilla Abdalla said indeed men leaders discriminate against their women counterparts. &ldquo;There are countless instances when male leaders have openly discriminated against me,&rdquo; she said.
