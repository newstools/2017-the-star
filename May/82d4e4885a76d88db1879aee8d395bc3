The national government, through the Northern Water Service Board, has allocated Sh2.65 billion for programmes aimed at mitigating effects of drought in seven counties.The money is part of the amount set aside for the Equalisation Fund in the financial year 2016-17. Samburu, the hardest-hit by drought, received Sh716 million, the highest amount, followed by Wajir&rsquo;s Sh530 million. Others are Garissa (Sh360 million), Isiolo (Sh144 ), Marsabit (Shs 433 million) and Mandera, which got Sh470 million. Laikipia, which is under NWSB jurisdiction, is not a beneficiary of the equalisation kitty.On Thursday, NWSB chief executive Osman Abdullahi commissioned the Sh61.5 million Libahley water pan in Diiso village, Garissa county. Speaking to the press, he said the project will ease water shortage among pastoralists who travel long distances in search of it.Osman said the water pan is the largest in the Northern region, with a capacity of 150 million cubic metres to serve 25,000 people for six to eight months. It will also provide water for between 40,000 and 50,000 livestock.&ldquo;The government has invested in this region in as far as addressing the perennial water shortage occasioned by severe drought is concerned. The project will save both humans and a huge number of livestock,&rdquo; Abdullahi said.Several parts of the region hit by severe drought since October last year to March are receiving rains.Abdullahi however said Balambala, Lagdera and parts of Dadaab in Garissa county will continue depending on water tracking because the areas have received inadequate rains. Garissa Township MP Aden Duale, also National Assembly majority leader, thanked state agencies for &ldquo;a commendable job&rdquo;.
