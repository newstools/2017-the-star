State House yesterday denied claims that the government introduced cheap unga to score political goals ahead of the August 8 general election.Spokesman Manoah Esipisu said the claims are the cheap politics and propaganda the opposition is using for political gain.The crisis that Kenyans found themselves in was a result of prolonged drought that the country and the region experienced, Esipisu said. This, he said, strained maize production.&ldquo;It is not lost to many of us that our country has endured one of the most severe droughts in our region,&rdquo; Esipisu added.Last week, the government reduced prices of 2kg packet of maize flour to Sh90 down from Sh150-Sh180 retail price. It blamed the drought for the skyrocketing prices.However, the opposition rubbished the justification and accused President Uhuru Kenyatta and his administration of mismanaging the economy and playing politics with the lives of Kenyans, leading to the high cost of living.But Manoah said, "I don&rsquo;t know how weather and politics or campaigns can come together. The bottom line for us is that unga is affordable again for the ordinary Kenyan and no matter the amount of debate or inquisition, there is nothing that can be done to change the fact that 2kg of unga [now] costs Sh90.&ldquo;You can doubt that, you can argue with it, but go ask Wanjiku out there and they will tell you that is the only thing that matters.&rdquo;He spoke in his weekly address at State House.Meanwhile, President Uhuru Kenyatta will this week travel to Italy to attend the 43rd G7 Summit.He will address the Summit.Ethiopia, Tunisia and Nigeria are the other African countries whose heads of state will represent teh continent in the conference.
