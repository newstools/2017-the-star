A key Senate watchdog committee questioning governors over audit queries yesterday said it hopes to conclude its work by mid-June to pave way for campaigns.Public Accounts and Investments Committee vice chairman John Lonyangapuo said the panel will pull all stops as it races against time to finish their probe on the 2014-15 audit queries.Auditor General Edward Ouko in his reports questioned the use of billions of shillings that were not properly accounted for.Governors will have access to complete reports two to five days after the committee finishes the sessions. &ldquo;We are burning the midnight oil and we hope we shall be able to clear this by June,&rdquo; Lonyangapuo told the Star.The West Pokot senator said the committee is aware it needs to conclude its work quickly to allow governors and senators seeking reelection to concentrate on their campaigns.Quorum hitchesThe committee is already experiencing quorum challenges as most members are battling for political parties&rsquo; nomination certificates, Lonyangapuo said.On Wednesday morning, Kiambu Governor William Kabogo appeared before the committee but there was no quorum, so he left.The committee requires only three members to start its sessions, but raising the number has been hampered by the heightened campaigns by members.Kisumu Senator Anyang&rsquo; Nyong&rsquo;o, who chairs the committee, has been missing in action as he fights for his political career after his nomination as ODM Kisumu governor nominee was challenged.Kiambu Senator Kimani Wamatangi admitted that going forward the panel may continue experiencing quorum issues.&ldquo;It is understood that the focus of some members may have shifted to nominations and now that we are gearing for elections it could be an issue. But we are up to the task,&rdquo; he said.The senator warned governors against hoping to get more time from the committee to respond to audit queries.&ldquo;They should come well-prepared because after we finish with one governor we want to go straight into report writing,&rdquo; he said.There has been pressure to have governors with pending audit queries barred from contesting the August 8 election over integrity and accountability issues.
