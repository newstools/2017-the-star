David ole Sankok has formally retired from the National Council for Persons with Disabilities after serving for three years as the chairman. Sankok,38, said he decided to voluntarily retire, and had notified President Uhuru Kenyatta that he does not wish his term to be extended because he wants to “engage in other businesses”. In his farewell speech to NCPD and Kenyans living with disabilities, Sankok said during his tenure, he managed to streamline the operations of the council, sealed corruption loopholes, which made them to be declared the cleanest state corporation in the 2015-16 financial year. “I was the luckiest chairman of a state corporation to chair a board that was made up of young, energetic, intelligent, progressive and supportive directors,” Sankok said on Monday. “Our board has been the largest in the country and many thought reaching consensus would be difficult. However, we sacrificed our personal interests and allowed the voice of reason and the interest of our stakeholders to lead us.” He thanked the President for recognising him during 2016 Mashujaa Day as a hero.
