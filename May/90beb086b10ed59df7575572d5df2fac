The Jubilee government is frustrating Western&rsquo;s economy deliberately, Lugari MP Ayub Savula has said.He said that failure to revive the ailing sugar industry, which is the backbone of the region&rsquo;s economy, shows Jubilee is plotting to manipulate voters.&ldquo;Mumias is dead, Nzoia Sugar is struggling and Pan Paper has been sold to Rai group of companies at a throwaway price so that it can use bagasse from sugarcane without paying farmers anything,&rdquo; Savula told the Star on the phone on Saturday.Savula, who was briefly linked to Jubilee before joining NASA, said he joined the opposition &ldquo;because JP frustrated projects in the region&rdquo;.He said, &ldquo;Local leaders will tell farmers to demand payment from Rai Paper Mills because bagasse is a byproduct of sugarcane.&rdquo;The bagasse is used to produce boards supplied to Raiply in Eldoret.The government has pumped Sh3 billion into the revival of the Mumias Sugar Company, and is set to release another Sh3.14 billion to turn it around. The state has also disbursed more than Sh500 million to Nzoia Sugar.Savula said the government removed the Sugar Development Levy instead of reducing the amount farmers are taxed.&ldquo;Farmers still incur liabilities any time they supply their cane to Mumias Sugar,&rdquo; he said.Savula continued, &ldquo;The levy is a consumer tax and does not help the farmer in any way. It was meant to maintain roads in sugar zones, but nothing is being done.&rdquo;He said farmers should be allowed to buy maize from the National Cereals and Produce Board, instead of being forced to pass through millers.Savula said none of Jubilee&rsquo;s projects in Western has taken off in four years.He said projects started by the grand coalition government in the region have also stalled.
