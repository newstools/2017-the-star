Rapper Bamzigi, famed for his stint on Necessary Noise and shaping the Kenyan urban music scene, has penned a raw letter detailing the life of an ex-addict.In the letter posted on Facebook, Bamzigi wrote, "You should know the problem ex-addicts like myself face day in day out no matter how many years you've been clean is the constant ridiculed and distrusted, from peers, coworkers and mostly family members."Adding: "The worst thing is we have to see counsellors each week and talk about our feelings (a notion I've still never gotten used too) anyway due to my erratic, &amp; some what angry behaviour due to some family unresolved issue at one of these sessions."He went on to say:"They usual demand for a drug test as protocol to see if my irrationality (their word not mine) was caused by drug use plus there's the issue of me losing weight, whinnies another tell-tell sign of using drugs." "I almost forgot the most important thing you as an ex-addict should always remember. Tell the truth always. If no one believes you then f*ck em. It's not your job to go around convincing them, that's the kind of stress that leads you back to the drugs eventually."He is set to release his latest joint Chini Ya Meza.
