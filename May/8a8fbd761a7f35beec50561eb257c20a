The Nyeri government has been urged to hire more nursery school teachers and improve school infrastructure.This will lift parents&rsquo; burden of paying salaries of teachers hired by the schools, Iria-ini ward Jubilee nominee David Kabatha said.&ldquo;ECDE classrooms are also in a bad state and since ECDE is a devolved function, the county government should rehabilitate them so that our children don&rsquo;t learn in windowless and earthen floor classrooms,&rdquo; he said.He pledged to be at the forefront in pushing the county government to improve ECDE infrastructure and academic standards in the ward when elected.Kabatha spoke on Saturday at Kiaritha-ini Primary School, where former students had visited to donate desks.
