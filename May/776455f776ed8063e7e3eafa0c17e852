Regional retailer Nakumatt Holdings has embarked on an accelerated restructuring programme aimed at cutting operational costs by Sh1.5 billion annually.Nakumatt Holdings managing director Atul Shah said the new operating strategy has been developed to provide a recovery platform and replace growth-driven Nakumatt 2.0 strategy rolled out in 2010.The struggling firm said it plans to reduce its store keeping unit exposure by retaining frequently purchased items and delisting slow moving products.Shah said the retailer will also close several of its poorly performing branches in Kenya and Uganda and open new branches at carefully selected high traffic locations.&ldquo;The branch culling strategy will start off with sub optimally performing branches for whose leases contracts are due for renewal to be followed by branches in poor locations,&rdquo; Shah said in a statement. &ldquo;We have also embarked on a shelf stocks optimisation programme to enable us retain a lean variety of profitable retail products.&rdquo;Shah confirmed the closure of Nakumatt Haile Selassie branch making it the third closure to be undertaken by the retailer in recent months following similar developments at its former Nakumatt Ronald Ngala and Nakumatt Katwe in Kampala.The firm, Shah said has also adopted a group-wide freeze on new staff hiring, opting to absorb and progressively deploy staff from recently closed branches to its existing and upcoming outlets.The cost cutting strategy is part of ongoing reforms demanded by the new strategic investor who is in final stages of injecting $75 million(about Sh7.76 billion) into the country&rsquo;s largest retailer by market share.
