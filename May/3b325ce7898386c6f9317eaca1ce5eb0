Mau Mau war veterans have urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to nominate one of their members to the National Assembly if he wins the August polls.Led by General Mwangi Kariuki, popularly known as Matenjagwo, the veterans said the nominee will participate in legislation and advocate for needy veterans.Speaking in Nyeri town on Wednesday, the veterans distanced themselves from Ngacha Karani, who is running for President as an independent. They said he is not a member of the Mau Mau freedom fighters as he claims.Matenjagwo said the veterans helped catapult Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto to power and deserve a seat. Matenjagwo also requested the Jubilee government to establish where Field Marshal Dedan Kimathi (statue pictured) was buried.
