An aspirant for Kisii woman representative has promised to support underage girls engaged in prostitution to venture into decent and legitimate income-generating activities. Norah Nyamwamu, running on the KNC ticket, raised concern over the rising number of young girls in commercial sex in Kisii town. &ldquo;I will sponsor them to take courses like hairdressing and tailoring, among others, and buy them equipment to start businesses,&rdquo; she said. The aspirant spoke at Nyanturago, Nyaribari Chache constituency, on Sunday where she took her campaigns. &ldquo;It is so disturbing that girls are dropping out of school at a tender age to ruin their lives in urban areas. We have to reverse the trend to save them,&rdquo; Nyamwamu said. She said she will use the National Government Affirmative Action kitty to empower women groups. Nyamwamu will face off with at least six contestants.
