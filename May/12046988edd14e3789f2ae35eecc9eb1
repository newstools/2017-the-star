More than 1,200 employees of the Nandi government have been sacked, sparking protests.Sources in the county have linked the sackings to Governor Cleophas Lagat&rsquo;s loss to Senator Stephen Sang during the Jubilee primaries.Those sacked include 800 ECDE teachers and 300 health workers who had been given jobs on contract. County drivers, protocol officers at the governor&rsquo;s office and his communication team are also among those affected.Jubilee Senate aspirant Samson Cherargei stormed the county headquarters, demanding the workers be reinstated. He said the county had not given tangible reasons for the sackings.&ldquo;We need a proper explanation on what happened. Mistakes by some individuals should not be blamed on innocent people,&rdquo; he said.Last Friday, county secretary Francis Ominde sent out a memo instructing departmental heads to revoke appointments of some employees on grounds they had been hired unprocedurally.He accused the County Public Service Board of hiring employees without consulting his office.
