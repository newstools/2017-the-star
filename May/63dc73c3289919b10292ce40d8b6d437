Two Nyeri governor aspirants are planning to unite and present one candidate in August.They are incumbent Governor Samuel Wamathai and hopeful Cocorico Githinji.The two participated in the Jubilee Party primaries, but lost to Wahome Gakuru. Both have since acquired independent candidate certificates.It was unclear whether Senator Mutahi Kagwe, who also lost in the governor race for the JP ticket, will join them.Sources said Wamathai is expected to pick Githinji as his running mate to make a strong team to face Gakuru in August.Wamathai comes from Nyeri town constituency and Githinji is from Mathira.Efforts to contact Wamathai were unsuccessful, but Githinji admitted there were such plans.He said several meetings have been held to discuss the matter. &ldquo;We are still consulting to see whether there can be such a unity. But what I can assure you is that we have everybody on board. We shall update you soon about the outcome,&rdquo; Githinji said.Sources close to Wamathai also said plans for the two to unite are underway. This will heighten the political temperature in Nyeri, since it will not be easy to defeat Wahome, owing to the perception that Nyeri is a &ldquo;Jubilee zone&rdquo;.Hotelier Patrick Munene is also in the race for Nyeri governor. He will run on the Democratic Party ticket.During the primaries, Nyeri residents sent home five out of six MPs and 29 MCAs in the Jubilee nominations.Kieni&rsquo;s Kanini Kega was the only MP who won the Jubilee ticket in the race as most of his colleagues were given a vote of no confidence.Among 30 MCAs, only Mweiga ward representative Mwaniki Kanyiri survived the primaries.
