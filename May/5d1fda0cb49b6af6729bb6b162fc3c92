The unprecedented wave of independent candidates for the August 8 General Election follows nominations that on all sides clearly demonstrated lack of capacity and good will.Many of the nominations were shambolic and unfair.However, the framers of the Constitution of Kenya 2010 were farsighted enough to make room for the option of independent candidates.There is great value in having independents run at general elections and even by-elections at both the national and county government levels.As we head towards the election, it is important the electorate looks at merit more than ever before, weighing and considering every candidate&rsquo;s potential and, or track record.Kenyans have previously often voted tribe and party, blinding themselves to many a viable alternative. The winners produced by voters who wear the twin blinkers of ethnicity and party loyalty have often failed massively, resulting in the current blight in the political sector and, by extension, in economic and quality-of-life factors.This time, Kenyans need to look very carefully at all options.
