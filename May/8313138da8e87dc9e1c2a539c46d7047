Five candidates have been cleared to run for the Machakos Senate seat after powerful incumbent Johnson Muthama bowed out.That opened the floodgates.The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission cleared Jackson Kala of Wiper, former minister Mutua Katuku (People&rsquo;s Trust Party), Carlos Kio&shy;ko (Maendeleo Chap Chap), Winfred Mutu&shy;a ( Jubilee Party) and Boniface Kabaka (C&shy;hama Cha Uzalendo).Speaking outside the IEBC offices after receiving his clearance certificate on Sunday, Katuku said he is qualified because of his experience as Mwala MP and Water assistant minister during the Kibaki administration.He promised to&shy; lobby for more funds from the national g&shy;overnment and development partners so the county can end the water shortage.Katuku said leaders must work together if the county is to transform.&ldquo;I promise to bring harmony to this county. This has been lacking for the last four years,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;I will play my roles as a senator and&shy; ensure resources are well-spent.&rdquo;Kala said he has worked in the county government as a chief officer and understands its problems.&ldquo;If elected, I will use that to champion proper legislation for the counties,&rdquo; he said.IEBC county returning officer Joyce Wamalwa said the five candidates had been duly nominated and she promised a free and fair elec&shy;tion.Muthama will not run for reelection but will focus on national campaigns.This came after he fell out with the Wiper leadership.&ldquo;The party leader has been imposing candidates and ensuring that by hook or crook these people become Wiper candidates,&rdquo; he said in a statement.Muthama has focused on campaigning for NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga.Wiper did not hold nominations for the position. It picked Kala after Muthama opted out of the race.Agatha Solitei, Wiper&rsquo;s National Elections Board chairperson, said Kala was picked because the party could not go to the polls without a candidate for the position.&ldquo;The deadline for all political parties to submit their candidates to the IEBC is Wednesday,&rdquo; she said in a phone interview with The Star.
