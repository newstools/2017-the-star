Siaya county residents have expressed fears of a poor maize harvest as a result of floods and the armyworm attack.Speaking to the Star on Wednesday, Peter Okumu, a large-scale farmer in Nyadorera, said he was lucky the armyworm did not invade his farm after he sprayed his 5,000 hectares of maize on time. But the floods submerged almost three quarters of his farm.He said many other farms were destroyed by armyworm and floods.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t foresee any reprieve in the cost of living if the government will not focus on value addition in agriculture as a long-term solution,&rdquo; Okumu said. Michael Otoyo, a large-scale farmer in Hono, said the armyworm invaded his 3,000-hectare farm. &ldquo;They destroyed the better part of my maize,&rdquo; he said.Otoyo said he is still spraying pesticide in his farm but is yet to get rid of all the armyworms.
