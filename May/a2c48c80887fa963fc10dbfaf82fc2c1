He is known to spend well-calculated time before releasing new music and when he finally drops a track, it has pace and depth of a big statement. It&rsquo;s what he does best.Compared to other Kenyan rappers in the game, Octopizzo is a better lyricist. His dynamic skillful, self-aggrandizing wordplay alone does it for him.
