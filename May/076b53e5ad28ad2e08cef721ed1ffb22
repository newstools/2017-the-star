DP William Ruto has not sent cash pledged during harambees in three schools in Bungoma county, the head teachers claim.Ruto reportedly pledged donations to Milo, Sinoko and Tongaren Secondary Schools in October 2016 when he visited the institutions as chief guest.He is said to have given some funds in cash then promised to send the balance in the various schools' accounts.In Tongaren, Ruto gave Sh2 million in cash and promised to wire the remaining Sh1 million.But school principal Biliah Lichuma told the Star that the money is yet to be wired to date."We are really under pressure from parents and the community who were present at the event and think we embezzled the funds," she said.She said efforts to reach the DP through the assistant commissioner's office has not yielded fruit.At Milo, Ruto reportedly pledged Sh3 million but only gave Sh1 million in cash.The DP made a similar pledge in Sinoko Secondary, Webuye East, but also only paid Sh1 million."We are still hoping the DP will heed to his pledge. We have lots of pressure coming from the board of management," principal Fred Kandawala told the Star on phone.Read: DP Ruto rushed to Kakamega to beat fundraising deadlineDuring that October visit, Ruto launched rural electrification in Siupla village.But a spot check by the Star indicates that only two houses were connected.
