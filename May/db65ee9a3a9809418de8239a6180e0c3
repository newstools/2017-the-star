Norman Magaya is the campaign's executive director."Ours will be an issue-based campaign," Kalonzo said yesterday. "We will tell Kenyans clearly what the difference between us and Jubilee is." The four teams have been told to read from the same script and ensure they deliver a consistent message wherever they go.When it is one month to the elections, the NASA team plans to hold daily press briefings, which will be done alternately by each of the five principals. Each principal will have one press conference a week.At the county level, NASA leaders will pick the county coordinators from constituent parties. The coordinators will then pick constituency coordinators and polling station managers."We will facilitate all these people to ensure that they are not just loyal to us but they work extra hard to mobilise voters and guard the vote," Mudavadi said.The NASA technical team is currently working on the coalition's manifesto, which they will launch next month.In the meantime, those campaigning for Raila have been asked to talk about specific things.NASA will pledge to grow the economy by, among other things, implementing effective fiscal policies, creating jobs by attracting foreign investors, supporting local manufacturers through reduction of power tariffs, encouraging entrepreneurship by giving opportunities to small businesses through low-interest loans, improving the ease of doing business and taking other steps.The opposition alliance will also pledge to lower the high unemployment rate through training and by giving loans for business start-ups.It will promise to improve agricultural production by empowering farmers and providing more and better extension services.
