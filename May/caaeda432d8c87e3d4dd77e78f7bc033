A non-governmental organisation is challenging the decision by ODM to submit a list of four nominees for appointment to the East African Legislative Assembly.Angaza Empowerment Network says ODM and Wiper forwarded the four names to fill four vacancies, and violated one-third gender rule by not including women.EALA election rules 2017 require that Parliament elects from nine persons among those nominated by political parties, the court was told.The two political parties jointly submitted the names of Abubakar Zein Abubakar, Judith Pareno (pictured), Ronald Ngeny and Kennedy Musyoka as their preferred candidates.Yesterday, the NGO said the appointment of the four was not done in a transparent and accountable manner.It argued the public was not allowed to participate. The organisation also took issue with Wiper boss Kalonzo Musyoka&rsquo;s decision to nominate his son, saying it amounts to nepotism.The NGO says Wiper&rsquo;s actions reeks of unfairness by a public body that draws money from the exchequer.It also said the list of four denies MPs an opportunity to vote for the best candidate, and reduces them to a mere rubberstamp because they have no option but to endorse them.The organisation alleges ODM and Wiper did not give reasons applicants for the EALA positions explaining why they were rejected. They want the appointment of the four stopped.
