Businessman Bundotich Kiprop, also known as Buzeki, yesterday said he is in the race for Uasin Gishu governor as an independent. This came after the Jubilee appeals tribunal rejected his complaints against incumbent Jackson Mandago&rsquo;s victory in the JP primaries. &ldquo;We have rejected that ruling and decided the will of my supporters will not be wasted. I will vie as an independent candidate as advised by my supporters&rdquo;, Buzeki said. He said more than 90,000 voters in Eldoret were denied an opportunity to participate in the primaries, which &ldquo;were marred by irregularities, as some people voted twice. We will not allow con men and brokers to mess up the wish of the people of Uasin Gishu by rigging the primaries. Let the voters decide on August 8,&rdquo; Buzeki said in Eldoret town. He accused Mandago of intimidating other communities so they do not vote. Mandao has termed as lies claims that he is against some communities.
