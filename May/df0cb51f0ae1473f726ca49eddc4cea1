The government says again that it will ensure peace and order during the electioneering period and polling. Nyandarua county commissioner Samuel Kimiti (pictured) and his Nyandarua West deputy Were Simiyu on Saturday assured residents security agents are on high alert to deal with those who disturb the peace. They spoke in Ol’Kalou and Ol Joro Orok towns, where they led security officers and residents in a peace walk. “As we engage in campaigns, many people will come from different areas. Some will attempt to disrupt our lives and disturb our peace. I warn them that the government is on the lookout.  They will not be tolerated,” Kimiti said. He urged youth to avoid politicians hell-bent on using them to cause chaos or attack rivals.  “I would not want you to be in hospital or jail,” he said.
