Politicians should stop using land as a bargaining chip to seek votes, Lands CS Jacob Kaimenyi has said.He said politicians at the Coast have been misleading residents about title deeds issued by the Jubilee government.Kaimenyi said the opposition has been going around saying the title deeds issued are fake, particularly for the controversial 930-acre Waitiki Farm in Likoni. The Jubilee government has received opposition since issuing title deeds to 8,000 squatters in January 2015.Two years down the line, the majority of title deeds are still lying at the Mombasa Lands registry awaiting collection.Each squatter was supposed to pay Sh182,000 for a piece of land, but the payment announcement did not go well with local politicians, who told the residents not to pay.President Uhuru Kenyatta said the squatters must pay to get land.He said the cash was needed for the Settlement Trust Fund kitty.The government is said to have paid farm owner Evanson Waitiki Sh1.2 billion as compensation to allow the squatters to continue living on the land.Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho and other local politicians have been at the forefront saying, &ldquo;Waitiki squatters cannot pay, and won&rsquo;t pay.&rdquo;Kaimenyi said these remarks have slowed down the collection of the title deeds.&ldquo;So far, 65 per cent of the title deeds have been collected,&rdquo; he said yesterday. &ldquo;Do not listen to politicians, and particularly this time, I want to appeal to all politicians to stop using land as a bargaining chip so people can elect them.&rdquo;He spoke in Mombasa after making an impromptu visit to the Lands registry.Kaimenyi found some officials absent. He warned workers against absenteeism.He said Kenyans should elect good leaders based on merit.&ldquo;We must not elect people who cannot even read the budget. How do you elect people who have D-? How do you elect people who have Es?&rdquo; Kaimenyi said.This was seen as a direct attack on Joho, who scored a D- in the KCSE exam.He has been accused of forging his KCPE exam certificate to gain entry to the University of Nairobi.The governor has said he is proud of his grade.&ldquo;My high school grades will not deter me from defending my people and protecting their rights,&rdquo; Joho said.It had been alleged Joho presented a forged 1992 examination result slip with a C+ mean grade. This was for a Bachelor of Commerce degree.But the governor, through county communications director Richard Chacha, said Jubilee manipulated some documents to suit its narrative.The circulated documents should not be relied upon, Chacha said, adding only the UoN can provide the actual position.In December last year, Mombasa MCAs accused Uhuru of favouring Central Kenya residents.This followed an announcement that the government would waive the Sh2.4 billion debt coffee farmers owed the government.Nominated MCA Mohamed Hatimy and his Tononoka counterpart Saad Faraj said Uhuru forced squatters on the Waitiki Farm to pay.&ldquo;My high school grades will not deter me from defending my people and protecting their rights,&rdquo; Joho said.
