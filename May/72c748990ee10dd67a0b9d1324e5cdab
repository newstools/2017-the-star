The IEBC has remained tight-lipped on the fate of candidates seen to have questionable integrity and cleared hundreds.By yesterday, the IEBC had cleared 962 candidates &ndash; 902 running for MCA, 55 for the Senate seat and four for the presidency.Former boss of the proscribed Mungiki sect Maina Njenga was among the candidates cleared.Njenga is running for the Laikipia Senate seat on the Kanu ticket.No candidate was turned away yesterday on integrity grounds.It is, however, understood most aspirants accused of failing the integrity test are governors, who are yet to start presenting their papers.Last week, IEBC chief Ezra Chiloba said, &ldquo;We will not clear candidates who have issues with institutions with competent jurisdiction that include Parliament. We will follow the due process of the law and disqualify such aspirants if there is no proof of an appeal in court or review in place.&rdquo;Civil society continues to pile pressure on the Wafula Chebukati-led IEBC to crack the whip on politicians with questionable integrity.In a letter to the IEBC dated Friday last week, the International Centre for Policy and Conflict said the IEBC cannot shy away from fully implementing Chapter Six of the Constitution.&ldquo;This is a duty the IEBC must neither take lightly nor shy away from,&rdquo; ICPC CEO Ndung&rsquo;u Wainaina said.He continued, &ldquo;The Constitution does not bar anyone from running for political office. However, it sets out clear suitability criteria for who can occupy a state office. Elected representatives on oath discharge the Constitutional duties.&rdquo;In a report titled &lsquo;RedCard20&rsquo;, rights groups Transparency International, Mzalendo Trust, Inuka Trust and the Society for International Development named 20 top politicians who should be barred from contesting.
