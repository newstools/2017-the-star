The cost of producing a 90kg bag of maize is expected to remain high this year, Tegemeo Institute researcher Timothy Njagi has saidCurrently, the cost of producing a 90kg bag of maize is Sh2,150 for small-scale farmers and Sh1,800 for large-scale farmers.Njagi yesterday attributed the rising cost to increased land rates. The rates increase by Sh1,000 per acre every year. The cost of chemicals to control the fall armyworm has been factored into the increase.&ldquo;The cost of labour is very high, going at 30 per cent, while the cost of fertiliser and harvesting take up 25 and 22 per cent. The recent fall armyworm outbreak has brought about an added cost for farmers, who have to buy expensive chemicals to control the pest,&rdquo; he said.He spoke during a press brief in Nairobi on the current food situation and rising commodity prices in Kenya.Njagi said despite the government fast-tracking an ambitious Sh20 billion fertiliser subsidy programme, productivity of maize per acre has decreased to seven bags from 26 bags, which is the potential level.&ldquo;Declining soil fertility, planting of low quality seeds and poor distribution of rainfall has interrupted the maize potential production rate per acre over the years. Giving fertiliser to farmers is not increasing production so we need to think of another way to invest and see the gains we expect,&rdquo; he said.Miltone Ayieko, a senior researcher at the institute, said focus should not only be centered on subsidised fertiliser, but also on other factors such as farm input and extension services.
