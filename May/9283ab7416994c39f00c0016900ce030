A Canadian woman who says she was denied a pedicure because of her weight says she went public about it because "everyone deserves pampering".Kimberly Adie, 27, says staff at a Winnipeg nail salon turned her away because of her size.She and her fianc&eacute; had gone to get a weekend pedicure together on a whim.This is not the first time a nail salon in North America has made headlines for the way overweight clients have been treated.A couple of salons in the US have been criticised for billing larger clients a surcharge on top of the regular bill.In this latest incident in Winnipeg, Ms Adie said that when she walked into the salon, two women who worked there stared her up and down.Then the salon manager told her they could not take her as a client, saying repeatedly she would not "fit".Her fianc&eacute; was told he could have get a pedicure."I was so stunned they told me I wouldn't fit in their chairs and yet they wanted to take my fianc&eacute;," she said.Adie and her fianc&eacute; went to another salon. By the time they arrived, she said she was in tears."I felt so ashamed of myself and so embarrassed about what I looked like," she recalled, but her fianc&eacute; cajoled her into getting the pedicure she wanted.She has received many positive messages since coming forward from others who have had similar experiences."They're glad someone was able to step up and voice what happened, instead of hiding behind a curtain and just accepting (it)."No one from the A1 Nail Pampers nail salon was available for comment on Wednesday.But the salon owner told CTV News Winnipeg that she was sorry about the incident and that they had been unable to accommodate Ms Adie on a busy Saturday.
