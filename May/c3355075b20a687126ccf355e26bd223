Laikipia Governor Joshua Irungu, the Jubilee Party flagbearer, has picked a youthful running mate.Irungu introduced Patrick Waigwa, 35, as his deputy shortly after receiving his nomination certificate in Nanyuki town on Monday.Waigwa holds a degree in Environmental Science. He is a close ally of Devolution Cabinet Secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri. Irungu faced various court battles before getting the certificate. He said he will not celebrate getting the certificate as that would be mocking his opponents.&ldquo;We shall instead hold prayers in all the three subcounties to thank God for the win. I would urge my opponents not to go the independent way, but join us in hunting for votes for President Uhuru Kenyatta,&rdquo; Irungu said. Once reelected, he said he would employ his opponents in his administration. Others who received their nomination certificates were John Kinyua (Senator), Catherine Waruguru (woman representative) and Mohammed Amin (Laikipia East).Nominated MP Sarah Lekorere received her certificate to run for Laikipia North MP.
