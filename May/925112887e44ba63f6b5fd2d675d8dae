An MCA has said Embu assembly is conducting illegal legislative business because several members have defected from their political parties. Jubilee&rsquo;s Kagaari South MCA Robert Ireri, while quoting Article 103, (1e) in the House, said ward reps who have officially resigned from their parties are supposed to step down. He said laws passed after the nominations risk being nullified on account of illegitimacy. Several MCAs have defected from Jubilee and will run as independent candidates.
