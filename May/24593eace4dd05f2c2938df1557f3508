Ben Pol is one of the top artistes in Tanzania, especially after the release of the monster hit song Muziki, featuring Darassa.Pol recently shocked fans after he deleted all his social media photos and after 48 hours, posted photos of him stark naked. The Moyo Mashine hitmaker told angry fans why.&ldquo;Mimi kama msanii unapotaka kuexpress hisia ya mtu aliyetekwa, unatakiwa ile image yako ionyeshe kwamba hakuna uhuru, hakuna haki. Lakini pia inatakiwa ionekane kwamba pengine haina privacy. Kwa hiyo hakukua na namna nyingine ambayo ningeweza kuonyesha hisia zangu. Nilitaka nipresent kitu ambacho kina feeling ya kutekwa.&rdquo;It turns out this was part of a publicity stunt he used to release another song he and Darassa have collaborated in, dubbed Tatu.
