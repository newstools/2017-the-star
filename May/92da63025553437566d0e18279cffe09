No vehicles have been able to travel to and from Vanga town, Kwale county, in the past week after floods destroyed the Lunga Lunga-Vanga road in Nyarini.Businesspeople and transporters of food products are making losses as they cannot transport goods.Homes have also been flooded and boreholes contaminated, raising fears of a waterborne disease outbreak. Cost of transport by motorcycle has also tripled.Heavy rains swept away part of the road, creating a ditch across the road and only motorcycles can pass on the edge of the ditch.A lorry transporting building materials has been stuck on the side of the road for six days since Friday.On Tuesday, Vanga residents protested, accusing the state and county of neglecting them. &ldquo;This place needs more wide culverts to ease the water flow,&rdquo; Joseph Chirunga said. Fish vendors are making losses as they cannot transport their produce to Likoni and Ukunda towns, and most suppliers are also unable to transport food into Vanga.
