The Lamu county government has spent more than Sh200 million on construction and refurbishment of more than 20 dispensaries and health centres.Health executive Mohamed Kombo yesterday said the facilities have also been equipped with modern equipment.He said the change has eased congestion that bedevilled the King Fahd County Hospital.Many patients had to travel tens of miles to get services.Governor Issa Timamy said more than 200 medical staff, including clinical officers, nurses and specialists, have been employed.The two spoke when they opened the Tewe and Uziwa dispensaries.Timamy said this will make room for improved development because &ldquo;people can only be productive when they are healthy.&rdquo;He said the county will continue to focus on health, education and roads to improve residents&rsquo; lives.&ldquo;All this is to ensure residents receive the best of medical care that money can offer,&rdquo; Timamy said.In March, the national government released Sh100 million for refurbishment of Lamu hospitals. Kombo said the money would be used to upgrade the Mpeketoni and Faza subcounty hospitals expected to be elevated to level-four status.&ldquo;Sh50 million will put up a modern maternity and children&rsquo;s wing at the Mpeketoni Hospital,&rdquo; he said.Last year, the government released Sh100 million for building an ICU, an accident and emergency unit, a modern theatre and renal unit in the King Fahd County Hospital.
