MPs will miss sittings on Tuesday next week to attend a key session with the electoral commission.The lawmakers yesterday adopted a special motion to suspend business for May 23 to attend a pre-nomination forum with the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission. The IEBC plans to hold a session with candidates for the August 8 election to brief them on poll preparations.The meeting is key as candidates seeking to participate in the elections will be taken through requirements for nominations. Candidates will also be taken through the documents they are supposed to present to the IEBC for clearance, including academic certificates.This will ensure candidates are not caught off guard on requirements they are supposed to meet when presenting nomination papers to the IEBC.Majority leader Aden Duale (pictured) moved the adjournment motion. &ldquo;It will not be good that our opponents will attend the meeting and we are not there. Let us allow members time to attend this meeting,&rdquo; he said.Minority whip Thomas Mwadeghu seconded the motion, saying the session with the IEBC will be of great interest for MPs seeking to participate in the polls.
