An aspirant for Kisii woman representative has promised to support underage girls engaged in prostitution to venture into decent and legitimate income-generating activities. Norah Nyamwamu,  running on the KNC ticket, raised concern over the rising number of young girls in commercial sex in Kisii town. “I will sponsor them to take courses like hairdressing and tailoring, among others, and  buy them equipment to start businesses,” she said.  The aspirant spoke at Nyanturago, Nyaribari Chache constituency, on Sunday where she took her campaigns. “It is so disturbing that girls are dropping out of school at a tender age to ruin their lives in urban areas. We have to reverse the trend to save them,” Nyamwamu said. She said she will use the National Government Affirmative Action kitty to empower women groups. Nyamwamu will face off with at least six contestants.
