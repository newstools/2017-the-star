Barclays Bank of Kenya, the country&rsquo;s fifth largest lender by market share, plans to increase its agency banking networks to rope in customers outside main urban areas.&ldquo;Our plan is to increase the number of service outlets to at least 6,000 outlets by 2019,&rdquo; Barclays Bank of Kenya managing director Jeremy Awori said in Nairobi.In March 2016, the bank partnered with state-owned Postal Corporation of Kenya to offer services such as withdrawals, balance inquiries, bill payments and mini-statements through 400 Posta outlets countrywide.During the 38th annual general meeting, shareholders decried lack of sufficient branches especially in the rural areas, low dividend payout as well as poor staff services as some of the bank&rsquo;s key challenges.&ldquo;You already know the work we have done with Posta. We are currently in talks with other agencies so that we can be able to sufficiently reach everyone,&rdquo; Awori said.The tier-one lender currently has 121 branches countrywide, serving more than 833,268 customers. The lender posted an after tax profit drop of 11.93 per cent to Sh7.39 billion in December 2016 from Sh8.40 billion in 2015. Barclays attributed the drop to a &ldquo;challenging macroeconomic environment with significant regulatory changes&rdquo;, including the interest rate cap implemented on September 14, 2016. The bank expects reduced operational costs after it cut its staff by 171 to 2,591 in 2016 from 2,762 employees the year before.Barclays Bank&rsquo;s latest annual report shows that staff costs, however, rose by 4.99 per cent to Sh9.77 billion in 2016 compared to Sh9.3 billion 12 months earlier.&ldquo;The sector experienced a challenging operating environment with significant regulatory changes and industry shake-ups that have caused banks to rethink their strategies and review their operating models,&rdquo; the bank&rsquo;s chairman Charles Munene told shareholders last Friday. In the wake of the interest rate cap law, most banks have resorted to staff cuts to minimise operational costs and protect profit margins for shareholders. Some of the lenders which have laid off staff Equity Group (about 400 employees through natural attrition), KCB (undisclosed), Standard Chartered Bank (about 300), Sidian Bank (108), First Community (105), Family Bank (undisclosed) and National Bank (undisclosed). In February, parent company Barclays PLC of London agreed to pay Barclays Africa nearly $988 million (about Sh102.34 billion) to fund the firm&rsquo;s split from its African business.The South African-based bank controls shares in 12 African countries, including 68.5 per cent of Barclays Bank of Kenya.Barclays Kenya has severally reassured customers the exit of Barclays PLC from Africa will not affect its operations in the country.
