NASA presidential flag bearer Raila Odinga has promised to expose the cartels behind the importation of the controversial maize from Mexico.Revisiting the sacking of William Ruto - then Agriculture minister in the grand coalition government, Raila said that he is committed to fighting corruption.Ruto, who is now Deputy President, was asked to step aside following his alleged involvement in the infamous 'Maize Scandal'."I sacked Ruto for messing up with the maize issue," he said on Saturday, adding that his orders were reversed after President Mwai Kibaki reinstated Ruto.He said the opposition knows the individuals and companies behind the maize scam and will inform the public of the same.Raila spoke in Rarieda during the burial of Gladys Onono, the mother of nominated Senator Elizabeth Ongoro and Rarieda ODM nominee Otiende Amollo.He dismissed President Uhuru Kenyatta's remarks that the skyrocketing maize prices following the shortage dated back to 2011."The price of maize in 2011 cannot affect the same in 2017. That is an absolute lie," the ODM leader said.Uhuru, during the Labour Party of Kenya convention on Friday, accused Raila of contributing to the high prices when he was Prime Minister.He said the situation was not handled well by the coalition government adding that it is that which also led to the current crisis."When people demonstrated against the high prices, Raila tear gassed people and the price never changed," he said.He added that during his tenure, the government imported maize following due process."The maize which arrived in Kenya on May 12 was acquired in a fishy deal that puzzles the public," Raila said.He was with ANC party leader Musalia Mudavadi, Senator James Orengo (Siaya), Governor Cornel Rasanga (Siaya), MPs Opiyo Wandayi (Ugunja) and Aduma Owuor (Nyakach).Bondo MP Gideon Ochanda, MP Oburu Oginga (Nominated) and Siaya woman representative Christine Ombaka accompanied Raila.There was a fierce argument on Thursday last week when the Agriculture committee's grilled CS Willy Bett over the importation of Mexican maize.The CS, accompanied by PS Richard Lesiyampe, was tasked with revealing the cause of the shortage, which some say is artificial.More on this: Five families behind maize shortage in Kenya, Mututho claims, demands actionAlso see: [VIDEO] Uhuru defends maize import, to make major announcement this weekMPs were of the feeling that the Agriculture ministry's officials dodged the real issues.
