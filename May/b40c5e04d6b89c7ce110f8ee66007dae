NASA will mount the mother of all campaigns that will eclipse Jubilee in all spheres, NASA National Campaign Committee chairman Musalia Mudavadi has said. “We will take on Jubilee on the ground, in the air, and even at sea in the Unga Revolution,” the ANC leader and NASA founder told the Star in an interview yesterday. He continued, “Ours is called the NASA Armada, sparing no Jubilee remnants. We’re sweeping through the country in a strategy of the mole that burrows itself underground at the roots. That’s how easy it will be to fell Jubilee thunderously like a giant tree.” Mudavadi said NASA is stationed in every cranny of the country. He said the alliance will not leave anyone out of the revolution. He said the NASA secretariat is brimming with great ideas from volunteers, adding the coalition is putting together a technical campaign team of high-level and skilled experts. “Most are distinguished Kenyans. We will unveil the team of our campaign architecture pretty soon. Our resources are the people. They’re volunteering ideas and their time. Ours is a people-driven campaign,” Mudavadi said. He said NASA is setting up the logistical support systems for its adopt-a polling station strategy to protect its votes. The strategy includes the ability to tally votes at the polling station and transmit them instantly to a well-resourced directorate. “That’s how serious we are against stealing the vote by Jubilee. Our resources are the people. You’ll be surprised how our in-tray is overflowing with creative ideas from all levels and status of Kenyans. They’re volunteering ideas and their time,” he said. He said businessmen, parents, farmers, teachers, youth and women are disenchanted by how Jubilee has taken them into the reverse gear.
