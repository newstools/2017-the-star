The health ministry has said it does not support proposed constitution amendments that seek to revert health services to the national government. In a letter to the clerk of the National Assembly dated May 12, Health PS Julius Korir said the ministry will continue to be a firm supporter of devolution &ldquo;to realize greater gains to the sector&rdquo;.The proposed Constitution (Amendment) Bill 2016 has been presented for scrutiny to relevant stakeholders by the Departmental Committee on Health before its publication. The committee argues that the transfer of health services from county governments back to the national government will ensure remuneration and promotion of health workers are managed equally across the country.The move was seemingly prompted by the numerous problems the health sector has faced since devolution took shape. Apart from the alleged loss of Sh5 billion shillings at Afya House, the sector is still smarting from a historic doctors&rsquo; strike that lasted 100 days paralyzing public health services across the country.Read: Doctors sign deal ending 100-day strikeAlso read: Nurses call off strike after signing deal with StateDoctors in some counties are yet to be paid their salaries and allowances since they returned to work.
