Are you doing the things you want to do? Or the things you think you should? Sometimes, other people&rsquo;s wishes tamp down our true desires for our jobs and careers. But dutifully fulfilling others&rsquo; expectations is unlikely to make you happy over the long run. To figure out what you&rsquo;re truly passionate about, try this experiment:1. Identify one specific activity to examine, whether it&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;re unhappy with or something you want to grow and develop in.2. Take a quick inventory of your personal values and passions. What drives you? What would you love to do if there was nothing in your way?3. Compare your passions with the activity you&rsquo;re examining. Is there any overlap between them? If not, it might be time to make a change &mdash; and to redirect where you focus your time and effort.
