A front runner in the Garissa governor race has accused the county administration of &ldquo;conmanship through illegal recruitment of desperate job seekers&rdquo;.Ali Korane said Governor Nathif Jama is usurping the powers of the county Public Service Board by issuing appointment letters to job seekers.&ldquo;The role of employing belongs to the county Public Service Board and is not the preserve of a politician or the governor,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;You cannot employ people just because you want to win their support, and even issue appointment letters. This is criminal and abuse of office.&rdquo;The county recently employed 364 revenue clerks and 80 drivers.Speaking to the press on Sunday, Korane said the PSB intervened and carried out an audit. It was discovered the governor had employed more than 1,450 illegally, he said.Korane appealed to the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission to intervene.He said Jama is taking advantage of desperate youths by fooling them into believing he has powers to hire them.Korane said the PSB should advertise vacancies, shortlist candidates, conduct interviews and finally hire deserving candidates.He said these procedures are not being followed. Korane said entry levels for various cadres should be indicated in the advertisements.Jama has defended his decision. He said government business must continue and that means recruiting where there are shortfalls.The governor spoke during the launch of the revenue enhancement programme on Sunday.Jama and Korane also competed in the governor&rsquo;s race in 2013. Jama won narrowly.
