NASA bosses led by Raila Odinga of ODM and Wiper's Kalonzo Musyoka on Friday accused the Jubilee administration of a failing in its leadership.They took their campaign to West Pokot county to drum up support for the alliance.They met supporters in Kapenguria before holding a public rally in Makutano town.Raila accused the government of doing little to lower the high cost of living.He said if NASA forms the next government, they will ensure basic commodities are affordable by putting in place policies to support businesses.Raila said high cost of living, insecurity, unemployment and corruption are among key challenges facing Kenyans.&ldquo;President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto have failed this country and Kenyans are tired of their poor leadership. NASA is bringing hope to Kenyans,&rdquo; he said.Raila said extrajudicial killings among the pastoral communities is a serious issue, pointing a finger at the Jubilee government.&ldquo;The Jubilee government has allowed innocent Kenyans to be killed in Baringo, West Pokot, Laikipa and Turkana counties. We want Uhuru and Ruto to take up responsibility of insecurity in the country,&rdquo; he said.Raila, who was accompanied by other NASA principals, said their manifesto is anchored on five key issues affecting Kenyans."We will lower the cost of living, improve security, ensure free education from primary to secondary level, proper implementation of devolution and create employment," he said.Kalonzo said Kenyans are ready for change, saying Jubilee should be ready to go home in August.He said the country cannot continue to be led by corrupt individuals, who only want to amass wealth for themselves.&ldquo;We are telling Kenyans to come out in large numbers in August polls to vote for NASA. This is the only way to ensure Kenyans are safe from the corrupt cartels running this country,&rdquo; Kalonzo said.Chama Cha Mashinani leader and Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto accused the DP of using the Kalenjin community for his own benefit with little to show in the five years he has been second in command.&ldquo;We cannot allow one man to continue doing business with our people. Ruto has failed our community,&rdquo; he said.Rutto urged the Pokot community to support NASA and be part of the next government.Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang'ula and ANC's Musalia Mudavadi said NASA will liberate the nation from the yoke of corruption and tribalism."Time has come for change and change is inevitable. Our bothers from the other side should be ready to go home because Kenyans have spoken loudly," Wetang'ula said.Also present were Turkana Governor Josphat Nanok, Siaya Senator James Orengo and Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa.
