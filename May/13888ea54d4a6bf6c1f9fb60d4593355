Lamu East MP Shariff Athman has dismissed Governor Issa Timamy's claims that tycoons want him out of office after August.Athman told Timamy "to carry his own cross" after failing to serve Lamu voters effectively in the last five years."The Governor failed Lamu by not initiating any project to improve the lives of our people. What we are seeing now are projects by the national government," Athman said."Even after the government provided enough money to purchase health equipment and ensure good roads, he failed to ensure residents got good services."The legislator, who joined Jubilee in August last year, said electorate are not interested in theatrics but development-oriented politics.Read: Lamu East MP Shariff ditches UDF for Jubilee "People want good health, business opportunities and better lives, not blame games," the MP said.On Wednesday, Timamy asked voters to reject his rival Fahim Twaha as he is not interested in leadership.Twaha will vie on a Jubilee Party ticket during the August 8 polls.Timamy said he wants to use the post to serve the interests of his "masters" who are tycoons and want to grab land and other resources in the county."He is bragging of development projects which were started by the national government. We will not allow him to escape without telling the people of Lamu where he took their money allocated by the government," Athman said.The Governor was elected on a UDF ticket but moved to ANC and will still contest the seat through party led by NASA principal Musalia Mudavadi."Giving out title deeds is not the work of the county. It is the work of the national government," the MP said on Thursday. [VIDEO] Lamu's Swahili villagers handed title deeds for first time since independence
