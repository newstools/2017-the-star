Public servants in Bomet county who were recruited irregularly by Governor Isaac Rutto&rsquo;s administration have been put on notice.Jubilee Party governor nominee Joyce Laboso said if elected she will ensure only those qualified for their jobs and hired on merit will not be affected in the &ldquo;cleanup&rdquo;.&ldquo;The public servants will definitely face the sack. We must all agree to that because we cannot have someone who never went to school being the boss of another with a degree or has the necessary credentials,&rdquo; she said.Laboso was speaking during a thanksgiving ceremony in Sotik on Friday.The National Assembly Deputy Speaker said there are many individuals serving at the county who were employed through the backdoor.Laboso said they hold plum positions because of their connections with those in power and draw huge salaries.She said her administration will ensure a fair recruitment process is adopted to the satisfaction of all residents.The Sotik MP said if elected governor, her administration will be all-inclusive.Laboso said she will bring leaders and players from various sectors on board in all developmental activities to spur the county&rsquo;s economic growth.&ldquo;If elected to the office come August 8, I will ensure equitable distribution of resources,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;And this will only be possible through the setting up of a county development board so that all leaders and stakeholders participate in the process.&rdquo;Laboso will faceoff with Governor Isaac Rutto, who is running on the Chama Cha Mashinani ticket.She beat former Konoin MP Julius Kones and Bomet Deputy Governor Stephen Mutai in the race for the JP ticket last week.They conceded defeat and pledged to support Laboso.
