ODM has asked NASA-affiliate parties to prepare for a tough battle, despite being under one umbrella.On Saturday, Jomvu MP Badi Twalib (pictured) and Mombasa woman representative hopeful Aisha Hussein said their party must have the majority in Parliament.Apart from ODM, NASA brings on board Wiper, Ford Kenya, ANC and CCM.&ldquo;How will NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga have his motions or bills passed if we are not the majority? How will his appointments sail through?&rdquo; Twalib asked.Jubilee has had an advantage in Parliament, because of its many legislators.Twalib said for Parliament to be completely &ldquo;donned Orange&rdquo;, each of its bedrock must vote to the last man for the party candidate.He said Mombasa is not a purely ODM zone as they shared seats with Wiper in 2013 and Jubilee has been attempting to make inroads into the area. Twalib urged voters to ignore other candidates who are not in ODM. Each NASA-affiliate party has been rallying its base to have their own candidate chosen.Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka said members, not independents, should be considered in areas perceived to be Wiper&rsquo;s stronghold. Only in battle grounds will the NASA share seats.Twalib spoke at Kajembe High School when he handed out bursaries to university, secondary and primary students.Hussein said Jubilee tried in vain to split the Mombasa vote bloc. She said they poached Likoni MP Masoud Mwahima and Deputy Governor Hazel Katana, but still struggle to make an impact.
