Ladies and gentlemen the script has changed and Kenyan men are doing everything possible to prove they are as romantic as the soap opera male lead stars.One Muindi Kimanzi is the current talk of the town after he pulled off one of the most romantic marriage proposals in the country.Just like in the soap operas; Kimanzi chose a nice secluded and serene venue to propose to his soon to be wife. On the day, he organised to have a heart-shaped floral arrangement on the floor, armed with a glittering ring, he went on his knee and popped the million dollar question to Alice.The highlight of this proposal was a serenade by Rnb great, Gilad Millo.Speaking to Gilad, the Israeli-born musician revealed to Word Is that it was one of the most romantic moments he's ever witnessed."The guy by the name Muhindi, a super romantic guy came and asked me if I can help him propose to his girlfriend Alice, he set up everything I just showed up to sing," he said revealing that Kimanzi was actually apprehensive and had to seek his musical help, owing to the fact that his girlfriend is a huge fan of his music.They did it at Kigwa Hotel along Kiambu road. "He took her for a lunch date at the hotel then we took it to the hotel's balcony. When she came, there was this heart-shaped floral arrangement on the floor she started freaking out, asking him 'What are you doing' so eventually he made his proposal and then he said to her 'I knew you would be difficult so I brought help', And he called out my name and I came out singing 'Sema Milele' yeah! we got her to say yes and it was pretty cool!" added Gilad.
