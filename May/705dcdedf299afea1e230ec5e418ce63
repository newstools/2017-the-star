Kiambu Senator Kimani Wamatangi survived the United for Kiambu wave led by Kabete MP Ferdinand Waititu during the Jubilee Party primaries.Wamatangi did not take sides in the competition, but fought alone.Other incumbents who backed Governor William Kabogo did not survive the wave and lost in the nominations.The United for Kiambu comprises Waititu as the governor nominee, James Nyoro as the deputy governor nominee, Kariuki Ngari (Gakuyo), Acquiline Njoki and John Mugwe.They led a revolution to remove Kabogo from office and Waititu won in the primaries.Donated tanks and vansWamatangi beat his closest contender Ngewa MCA Karungo wa Thang&rsquo;wa who was supporting the United for Kiambu team and used their platforms to campaign.&ldquo;I believe that my track record speaks for itself and Kiambu people will elect the better person for the senate seat and I do not need to align myself to any political outfit as the seat is not mine but for the people of Kiambu and I will respect their decision,&rdquo; Wamatangi had said before the nominations.The senator chose to campaign on his own. He bought 12 community vans which offered free services in weddings, funerals and family gatherings. The vans came with public address systems.He donated water tanks and sponsored youth for computer studies and helped them establish small and medium enterprises.Campaigns on SMSIn 2013 elections, Wamatangi did not campaign vigorously as he did this year and chose to use text messages, which constantly reminded Kiambu residents to vote for him. It worked in his favour and he was overwhelmingly voted in as the first Kiambu senator.In 2015, Wamatangi and Waititu were embroiled in a war of words, when Waititu accused him of urging residents not to vote for him for Kabete MP and trying to sideline him for not being a local.The seat fell vacant after George Muchai was shot dead on February 7 last year. Waititu won the by-election on March 4 last year.In his four-year tenure, Wamatangi constantly put the county government in check. It almost turned ugly during the Senate Public Accounts Committee when Kabogo was summoned to answer queries on accountability.Wamatangi stood his ground and demanded that Kabogo explain how he had spent county cash.
