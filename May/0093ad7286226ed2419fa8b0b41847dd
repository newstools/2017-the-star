Seven African states will roll out drug rehabilitation programmes offered at the Medically Assisted Therapy clinic in Kisauni dispensary, Mombasa, to help heroin and cocaine addicts.The programme has been billed as a success, with Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi, Ethiopia, Mauritius, Zanzibar and the Seychelles saying they will replicate it in their countries.MAT, also known as Medication-Assisted Treatment, uses medicine, counselling and behavioural therapies to treat substance use disorders and prevent opioid overdose. MAT is primarily used to treat addiction to opioids such as heroin, and prescribes pain relievers that contain opiates.The decision to replicate the Kenyan initiative came after policymakers and experts from the seven countries toured the facility last Wednesday, five months since it was opened.
