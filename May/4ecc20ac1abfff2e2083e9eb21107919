Governor Sospeter Ojaamong has rubbished claims that NASA presidential flag bearer Raila Odinga is meddling in Busia politics.This was after a section of ODM officials on Monday cautioned the opposition chief against concentrating on local politics. The group said such engagement might derail his focus on the presidential campaigns ahead of the August 8 general election.Raila is facing off with Jubilee Party's President Uhuru Kenyatta in the election that has also attracted at least 18 other candidates.The officials from Nambale, Budalangi, Butula, Funyula and Matayos declared to support Funyula MP Paul Otuoma.Otuoma is running as an independent candidate after he resigned from ODM after Ojaamong was named ticket winner.Read: Otuoma resigns from ODM over Busia governor ticket debacleIn a press briefing on Thursday, the governor dismissed the officials saying they were "fronting petty allegations"."We will not be shaken but will instead focus on consolidating governor and presidential votes for August.""Some of those issuing such statements are no longer members of ODM. Let them leave Raila out of this," he said."Whoever is willing to decamp to Jubilee is free to do so," the governor added after verifying his name in the voter's register.Also read: Otuoma quits ODM after losing Busia ticket, promises to support RailaHe said at Busia Township Primary school that they will ensure that NASA carries the day during the scheduled polls.He urged voters to dismiss assertions by people who had abandoned ODM and opted for other parties out of greed for power."I am confident that I will carry the day. Let the rest from Ford Kenya, Jubilee, ANC try their lack as well," he said.On whether he will drop Deputy Governor Kizito Wangalwa as his running mate, he said talks are ongoing on who to settle on.Sources close to the Governor have however revealed that he is planning to replace Wangalwa.The argument is that the DG cannot marshal enough voters from his Butula home turf, a factor that will determine his retention or not.Ojaamong called upon Busia voters to confirm their details before IEBC closes the voter verification drive."We want all voters in Busia and the country at large to ensure that they visit their polling stations to verify their data.""Ensure your name is in the register and append a signature or thumb print where your photo is," he said.Ojaamong's appeal came a few days after two voters in Matayos constituency petitioned IEBC to register them afresh.The two did not find their names in the voters' register. The commission kicked off the 30-day drive on May 11.
