Endebess MP Robert Pukose (pictured) has moved to court seeking to reverse a decision by the Political Parties Tribunal to order a repeat of the nominations for the constituency.He yesterday said it is unfair to subject him to another exercise &ldquo;when I clearly won the nominations&rdquo;.Through his lawyer Stephen Gitonga, the politician wants the court to stop the repeat primaries, adding his opponent Alvin Sasia &ldquo;is trying to get to use back-door channels&rdquo; to join the race.Sasia moved to the Political Parties Tribunal and challenged the results.Pukose says the tribunal, chaired by Kyalo Mbobu, along with James Atema and Paul Ngotho, ordered a retallying of ballot papers.He was declared the winner for a second time on May 17, only for Sasia to move back to the tribunal.On Friday, Sasia obtained a judgment from the tribunal ordering a repeat of the exercise in 96 hours.
