The White House says it is unaware whether the deputy attorney general threatened to quit after he was blamed for the FBI chief's sacking. Rod Rosenstein reportedly was on the verge of resigning after the White House cast him as the prime catalyst to fire James Comey, US media reported. He detailed Comey's "serious mistakes" in a memo to President Donald Trump, just prior to the firing.The sacking of Comey has ignited a firestorm of criticism.Democrats have called for a special prosecutor to take over the probe of alleged links between the Trump election team and Moscow, which Comey was heading.Rosenstein reportedly made his threat unless the White House conveyed that the decision began with the president, according to US media."I'm not aware of his threatening to resign," White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on ABC's programme Good Morning America on Thursday.She maintained that Trump "very much had been thinking about letting Comey go since November 9".Lawmakers in Washington are reeling after the White House abruptly removed Comey on Tuesday for his handling of the inquiry over Hillary Clinton's emails.Critics accuse the Republican president of firing the nation's top law enforcement official because he was leading the Russia inquiry.Senior Democrats have also said they believed Comey had recently asked the justice department for more resources for the FBI Trump-Russia investigation, which they say could have prompted his dismissal.
