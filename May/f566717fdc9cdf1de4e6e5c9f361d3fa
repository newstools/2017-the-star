Narok should not vote for NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga but reelect JP&rsquo;s President Uhuru Kenyatta because his administration has implemented development projects in the county, a leader has said.Narok Governor Samuel Tunai yesterday said, &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t vote for Raila. I don&rsquo;t know how to work with him. Uhuru is the best person I can work with.&rdquo;Speaking in Narok town, Tunai said the opposition leaders were in power for long but they did nothing for the country. &ldquo;All these opposition leaders have been in government and there is nothing we can celebrate as Kenyans,&rdquo; he said.Tunai has dared NASA to make good its threats to boycott the August 8 election over an appeal by the IEBC to have presidential results announced by its chairman. NASA wants results announced at the constituency to be final.
