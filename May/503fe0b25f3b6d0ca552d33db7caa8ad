But for the governor, we would like to state that it is time to shift our political allegiance. We will support Muriithi with our resources and logistics,&rdquo; he said.The professionals spoke during a luncheon they hosted for Muriithi and his running mate John Mwaniki at Laikipia Permaculture Centre in Segera ward.Last week, three independent candidates stepped down in Muriithi&rsquo;s favour.They are former Foreign Affairs PS Thuita Mwangi, James Mathenge and Woodboy Mwangi.
