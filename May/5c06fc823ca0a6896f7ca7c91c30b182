Trans Nzoia is set for a rematch between Governor Patrick Khaemba of Ford Kenya and Jubilee Party&rsquo;s Maurice Bisau on August 8.The two ran for the same seat in 2013, where Ford Kenya&rsquo;s Khaemba won with more than 89,063 votes, ODM&rsquo;s Noah Wekesa was second with 37,988 votes and New Ford Kenya&rsquo;s Bisau was third with 33,177.But the political trends have slightly changed after Bisau defected from New Ford Kenya to JP.Last week, Bisau was declared the winner of the JP nominations.Bisau garnered 51,604 votes while his rivals Bethwel Kirior and Joshua arap Sang came in second and third with 13,741 and 11,078 votes, respectively.Others who contested for the party ticket include Martin Ngomat, who garnered 9,334 votes and Festus Mukoya, who managed 7,525 votes.Bisau will now face Khaemba, who was given a direct ticket by Ford Kenya.The competition will mainly be a two-horse race. They are both from the Bukusu community, though the county is largely cosmopolitan.
