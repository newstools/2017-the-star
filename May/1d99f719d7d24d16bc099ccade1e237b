Kenyans will from today start buying a 2kg packet of maize flour at Sh90. The price had skyrocketed to Sh150 in six months. Agriculture CS Willy Bett yesterday said the government has entered into a subsidy programme in partnership with importers and millers who will buy a 90kg bag of maize for Sh2,300.A one kilogramme packet will cost Sh47. The new prices will be effective from today until the harvest season.The government, he said, has resorted to importing maize and selling it to millers at Sh2,300 to tame the rising cost. Before the imported maize arrived in the market, a 90kg bag cost Sh4,620, while in the region, the same cost Sh4,300. Bett said the imported maize is supposed to cost Sh3,600 a 90kg bag, but the cost has been subsidised. &ldquo;The government will inject not more than Sh6 billion into the subsidised programme to cushion farmers against the high cost of living,&rdquo; he said.Bett added that the programme is meant to stabilise the market.The government yesterday issued a public notice on the drought alleviation programme that seeks to reverse the rise in prices of essential food. Twenty millers are taking part in the programme also known as #BambaUngaNa90Bob. Agriculture PS Richard Lesiyampe said the current maize stock is at 980,000 bags and will last until the end of the month. The government intends to import five million bags of maize until the end of July.&ldquo;We expect to import 2.9 million bags of maize in June and 1.2 million in July,&rdquo; Lesiyampe said.The first consignment of maize from Mexico arrived in the country last week. According to the Cereal Millers Association, the second vessel will get to the Port of Mombasa in three weeks.
