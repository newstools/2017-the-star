I just could NOT hold it back....especially when his people said f* my Moms....I almost became physical yo!!! This is Kenya....a*hole! Forget Jamrock....Welcome to the 254! Here, I can keep it real.... ...and y'all about to criticise me.....WHATEVER....He brought my Mother into it. Sauti Sol na Nyashinski have never insulted me....so..." he said in a video that has gone viral.Sauti Sol&rsquo;s Bien Baraza was pissed off with Chiko Lawi and he jumped on the &lsquo;trend&rsquo;, savagely attacking the Kwese Sports presenter, stating, "You actually don&rsquo;t know how he&rsquo;s feeling. He may be battling some serious personal issues and a selfie is the last thing he needs. You feel like you&rsquo;ve won but you&rsquo;re losing."He went ahead to tell him that was so low of him. "Bro, I'm your friend but you have seriously let me down here. This is so stupid. it&rsquo;s just not necessary. And what&rsquo;s with all these people applauding this shit!!!!! f**k!!!!
