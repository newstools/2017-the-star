The anti-graft agency has closed the file on Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho&rsquo;s KCSE exam certificate case, an EACC detective has said.The sleuth was involved in the probe and spoke on condition of anonymity.Joho was accused of forging a 1993 KCSE exam certificate to be admitted at the University of Nairobi.He was accused of presenting a C+ (plus) certificate. But Joho denied this and publicly admitted he scored a D- (minus). He said he sat his KCSE exam in 1994 and not 1993 as purported.A D minus grade is not admissible at university.&ldquo;The response the body [EACC] got from the Tom Mboya Primary School head teacher was satisfactory and added up. Same to Serani Secondary School,&rdquo; the detective said.EACC deputy CEO Michael Mubea was unavailable for comment. He did not respond to calls and text messages.In a ruling on Wednesday, Justice Chacha Mwita rejected a renewed attempt to bar the IEBC from accepting Joho&rsquo;s nomination papers.
