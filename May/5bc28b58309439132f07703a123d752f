Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago has said he failed to appear before the Senate last week because he was on paternity leave.He denied claims that he defied summonses to appear before the watchdog committee to respond to 2015/16 audit queries raised by the Auditor General."There is no way I can snub the Senate which is a lawfully established institution. It is just that I have been on leave to take care of my family."Mandago declined to appear before the Senate for questioning over financial management in Uasin Gishu."The Senators understand very well that as a man who is married, am entitled to paternity leave," he told journalists in Eldoret on Friday.The county chief said his failure to appear should not be misinterpreted in any way.The Senators turned away Deputy Governor Daniel Chemno and officials from the finance department who had gone to represent Mandago.The team also refused to hear another group from Bomet which had been sent to represent Governor Isaac Rutto.Governor Rutto also failed to turn up citing other engagements.Public Accounts and Investment committee vice chairman Prof John Lonyangapuo (West Pokot senator) said they want both Mandago and Rutto to appear in person."Those who came are not the ones we summoned to appear," Lonyangapuo said.He said the committee wants Mandago and Rutto surcharged for the costs illegally incurred by the teams they dispatched to the Senate.Mandago said he will appear at the Senate on June 7 as directed."I will not fail to attend since I respect the Senate," Mandago said.He at the same time opposed the government's plan to shut down the IFMIS during the election period.Mandago said the shutdown will paralyse county operations yet Kenyans require services all the time including at the time of elections.The governor said fears of misuse of public funds during polls were misplaced because there are established institutions to check on graft. The senate team has on many instances warned governors against defying the summons on grounds that such acts make them complicit in the matters under probe.Read: Defy Senate summons at your own risk, governors toldAlso read: Governors to defy Senate summonses, say calls to appear are politically motivated
