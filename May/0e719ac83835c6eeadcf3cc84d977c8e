Jubilee Party Limuru MP candidate Peter Mwathi has praised the IEBC for its efforts to reassure aspirants the August 8 polls will be free and fair. He spoke after an IEBC briefing in Limuru constituency on Tuesday. Mwathi said, “The nominations challenged the officials who administered them. The IEBC needs to equip the officials it hired recently with knowledge and skills to handle any kind of issue that may arise.” He continued, “We saw a lot of complaints presented at party tribunals and you can imagine if those were election appeals. We need everyone to feel the results announced after the election are free and fair.” Mwathi urged residents and politicians to respect each other. He urged aspirants not to incite voters, adding “campaigns come and go”. “Those of us who have won and lost before know we all need each other,” Mwathi said.
