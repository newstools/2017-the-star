South Koreans are voting in a presidential election, called early after a huge corruption scandal brought down their former leader.Left-leaning Moon Jae-in is the clear front-runner with centrist Ahn Cheol-soo his nearest challenger.The election is being closely watched at a time of economic uncertainty and heightened tensions with North Korea.Moon wants to increase contact with the North in contrast to ex-leader Park Geun-hye who cut almost all ties. Moon, of the Democratic Party of Korea, has called for an "overwhelming victory" as it would help to heal a national divide caused by the impeachment of conservative Ms Park."I feel that not only my party and myself but also the people have been more desperate for a change of government," he told reporters on Tuesday morning after he cast his vote.Ahn said he was still confident he could win and that he would "wait for a wise judgement from the people".Conservative candidate Hong Joon-pyo said the election was a "war of regime choices" between a "North Korea-sympathising leftist government or a government that can protect the liberty" of South Korea.There are 13 candidates running for the presidency.
