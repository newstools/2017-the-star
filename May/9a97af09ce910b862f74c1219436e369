The Anti-Corruption Court yesterday gave four months to embattled Nairobi chief of staff George Wainaina to finalise his application in the High Court seeking to terminate his case.Wainaina is accused of bribing Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko to stop him from blowing the whistle over corruption in the county in 2015. He denied offering Sh1 million to Sonko on January 5, 2016, at KICC. During the mention of the case yesterday to confirm the outcome of the High Court case, trial magistrate Lawrence Mugambi was told the matter is still pending with the trial judge. Wainaina was given more time to have the application heard and determined.The graft case has been pending in the lower court without proceeding to hearing since early 2016 after Wainaina obtained a stay order.
