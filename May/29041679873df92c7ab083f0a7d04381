Matatu operators and traders at the Busia bus park have said they will stop paying revenue to the county government until it is rehabilitated.Speaking to the Star at the bus park on Tuesday, the businessmen, led by Busia Business Owners Association chairman Steven Obala, said the county has failed to allocate funds to facilitate the park rehabilitation. &ldquo;We are paying a lot of money to the county government of Busia daily, but the service provider has refused to renovate the area,&rdquo; Obala said. The traders also said they are incurring losses as the flooded bus park stops customers from accessing the park. Obala said despite channelling their grievances to MCA Solomon Onyango, he has not taken any action. The traders held a peaceful demonstration demanding immediate rehabilitation of the bus park, but their cries went unanswered.
