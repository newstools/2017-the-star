Homa Bay Town MP Peter Kaluma (pictured) has said legislators who unsuccessfully contested for the ODM ticket frustrated the party list of nominees to the EALA. Kaluma is a member in the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee. He said they have been faced with the hard task of lobbying the MPs to support the list.He said the MPs do not want to mix with them, despite being in ODM.&ldquo;The difficulties we experienced in approving the list were due to the lack of commitment by members who lost in the primaries,&rdquo; Kaluma said. Claims of back-and-forth arguments are said to have marred the approval of ODM nominees to the East African Legislative Assembly. Speaking on Ramogi FM on Tuesday night, Kaluma, who won the ODM ticket, cautioned supporters against electing independent candidates. He said NASA will lack the numerical strength in both the Senate and National Assembly if the coalition forms the government and more independent candidates are elected.
