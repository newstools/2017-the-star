Gender and Youth Affairs CS Sicily Kariuki has urged MPs to stop interfering with government projects to improve lives of young people. She said youth and women benefit by developing skills and getting funds to start businesses. Kariuki spoke on Saturday at the Kwambira market in Limuru subcounty, where she launched a youth empowerment programme. She told legislators to be careful when debating bills related to the projects so they don’t undermine development. “Politicians are our brothers and sisters. When you are in Parliament, you must not interfere with youth projects,” Kariuki said. She wants the youth to protect the projects against interference. “You must defend yourselves and your interests,” Kariuki said. She was accompanied by MP John Kiragu and assistant county commissioner Gatobu Kirera.
