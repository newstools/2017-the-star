Busia  County Referral Hospital is appealing to residents to donate blood. It says many patients are in need of blood. Kenya  National  Blood Transfusion  Service Busia Satellite manager  David Bulimu  on Tuesday said the centre had only 12 pints, which are still being processed. Addressing the press at the  Transfusion Centre, Bulimu said Kakamega, Kisumu, Bungoma and Eldoret, which used to bail them out during emergencies,  have also run out of blood. “This leaves us in a precarious position  with our hopes now on good Samaritans to  visit our facility from today [Wednesday]  onwards  to donate blood  and  help save  lives of patients whose lives hang in the balance. We have been forced to transfer 17 patients to other hospitals outside the county who needed blood transfusion. We still receive many other  patients especially those with anaemia, sickle cell, accident and  mothers who develop complications during delivery,” he said. Accompanied by hospital administrator Eric Wamalwa, Bulimu said people aged between 16 and 60 years can donate blood.  Busia journalists have offered to donate blood on Friday. “We lost two children and one adult last month due to blood related ailments. We cannot afford to lose more lives,” Bulimu said. He said willing donors should visit the blood satellite  centre  customer care desk for more information.
