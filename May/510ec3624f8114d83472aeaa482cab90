Kanu leaders in West Pokot have urged residents to kick out the county leadership for not keeping its election promises.They were led by Senator John Lonyangapuo, who is eyeing the governor&rsquo;s seat, and former Information minister Samuel Poghisio.They criticised Governor Simon Kachapin for barring NASA from holding a rally in Makutano Stadium.&ldquo;Raila [Odinga] is a senior person and it is wrong for the governor to deny him the venue to seek votes,&rdquo; Lonyangapuo said.The leaders spoke in Kapenguria town on Sunday after Poghisio was cleared by the IEBC to run for senator on the Kanu ticket. Lonyangapuo urged residents to welcome all politicians, regardless of their political parties.&ldquo;We have now started realising people who are tribal. It&rsquo;s shame to lock out visitors,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They [Kachapin&rsquo;s administration] have misplaced priorities. We first need to offer services to our people, not start by building offices,&rdquo; Lonyangapuo said. He promised to buy and stock maize in all subcounties, provide water, promote education and upgrade slums.
