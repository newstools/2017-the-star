Good morning, fine people. I want to wake you all up to a story about Betty Kyallo. I actually highly suspect I am the hater she was taking about on her social media accounts.But the way I am designed, I am no hater. I cannot hate on someone who "sells the headlines". But away from that and back to the matter at hand. I recently got the opportunity to ask Betty Kyallo Mutei some questions &mdash; you know, the type everyone is asking each other in hushed tones, aye?And indeed, I asked Betty Kyallo Mutei whether the reason behind her move from her Kilimani apartment was because she and Okari were getting back together, and her answer was a rather surprising and succinct one.Betty *chuckles* "Let me prosper." One of the questions at the tip of everyone's tongue is..."ARE YOU AND DENIS OKARI GOING TO RECONCILE?"
