A Mombasa court yesterday barred the National Housing Corporation from evicting at least 260 families living in its houses in Changamwe.Judge Erick Ogola further ordered the tenants to continue paying rent as per their lease agreement.The tenants sued the NHC for increasing rent without notice and consultation.Rent for a one-bedroom house was increased from Sh4,800 to Sh10,000, while two-bedroom house would have cost Sh11,000 from Sh6,000.Those living in three-bedroom houses would part with Sh12,000 up from Sh7,000.Lawyer Elaine Mukoya said the tenants have protested against the rental increases but the NHC management failed to respond.The tenants accused the housing corporation of demanding higher rents yet it has failed to maintain health standards.The tenants told the court walls, drainage systems, walkways and roofs are in disrepair.The NHC, however, offered the tenants a new lease that will run for two years.Tenants will now pay a standard monthly rent of Sh10,000.
