A Kiambu ODM aspirant has urged residents to elect NASA presidential flagbearer Raila Odinga.Mary Muigai, who is running for Limuru Central MCA, said Raila will win with a landslide on August 8.The seat is currently held by MCA Njenga Murugami."Never underestimate Raila's support countrywide. People have heard that he wants to manage the resources of this country," she said.Muigai warned that since Kiambu is President Uhuru Kenyatta's home-turf, residents might vote mainly for Jubilee candidates.The youthful leader also urged residents to elect her, saying she will be at the forefront in oversighting the Kiambu government.Muigai spoke after attending a candidates briefing by the IEBC at Kirathimo Social Hall in Limuru on Tuesday.The accountant is urging her party to assist her financially, saying she was sacked from a restaurant she was working at in Limuru town, when she started campaigning for Raila.She said leaders from the same party cannot check and blow the whistle against the government of the day, hence the need to elect leaders from other parties.The aspirant urged residents to vote for a leader who will highlight and present their plights, defend their rights and needs at the assembly and at the government.Muigai will run against Jubilee Party nominee Joseph Kahenya, who defeated Murugami in the primaries.She said, "I know they need better roads, improved markets and better representation during the making of bills that concern them. This is not a time for parties.&rdquo;Muigai urged residents to pray for peace.
