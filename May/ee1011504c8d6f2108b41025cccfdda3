Corruption in the Ministry of Health has returned to haunt Jubilee after the US government suspended Sh2.1 bil- lion assistance.The move could hurt service delivery in public health facilities.The ministry had been hit by a Sh3 billion scandal that is believed to have triggered the transfer of PS Nicholas Muraguri to the Lands docket.US Ambassador Robert Godec yes- terday said, &ldquo;What we have done on health assistance is to temporarily suspend technical support that goes directly to the Ministry of Heath be- cause of the ongoing concerns about accounting processes and procedures that revolve around corruption.&rdquo;He added, &ldquo;The US taxpayers want to see that their money is spent appropri- ately and goes into the right causes.&rdquo;A leaked internal audit last year lifted the lid on graft in the ministry, but investigating agencies, including the EACC, are yet to nail any of the suspects.If the suspension continues for an extended period, the implementation of policies is likely to slow down. This will delay the execution of emerging interventions.Service delivery at referral facilities such as Kenyatta National Hospital, may suffer.The suspension, Godec said, will give the government time to provide accounting and tracking systems for funds allegedly misappropriated.The envoy clarified the suspension of technical support should not be mis- interpreted to mean relations between the US and Kenya &ldquo;have grown apart&rdquo;.He said the two governments enjoy a cordial working relationship and as- sured Kenya of further support.In a statement to newsrooms, Health CS Cleopa Mailu said the suspension only affects programme administrativesupport, not service delivery, and that it may be temporary.&ldquo;We wish to assure development partners and the people of the minis- try&rsquo;s commitment to prudent financial management and accountability for re- sources placed under our stewardship,&rdquo; Mailu said.USAID on Monday issued a notice to suspend funding for activities carried out by a number of Ministry of Health departments. In a letter dated May 8, the US agency cited unspecified condi- tions that have not been met by some implementing partners.The letter shows funding for the pro- curement of commodities and equip- ment related to life-saving treatment, prevention, outbreak or emergency response have been exempted. The surveillance and service delivery will continue receiving donor cash from USAID. The suspension will lead to sal- ary cuts for staff including project coordinators and administrative workers.
