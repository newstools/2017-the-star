Emuhaya MP Wibur Ottichilo has said ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi got a crucial part of the NASA power structure as Premier Cabinet Secretary.He said Mudavadi&rsquo;s position in the NASA administration will put him in charge of government functions and dismissed claims that the community was short-changed.&ldquo;Those trying to divide us by saying some principals got better positions than others have nothing to say. We must shame them,&rdquo; Ottichilo said on Saturday.He told those spreading such lies to look for something else to talk about and warned them that Western residents are firmly in NASA.Ottichilo said the five NASA principals negotiated and struck a deal as equal partners and none is greater than the other.He spoke in Mbale Municipal Grounds, where he unveiled Patrick Saisi as his running mate for the Vihiga governor race.The legislator also unveiled his manifesto, which he said will strongly focus on creating a lean and efficient government that will fix the county&rsquo;s problems.Vihiga Governor Moses Akaranga has yet to unveil his running mate after he dropped Caleb Amaswache.He is defending the seat on the Progressive Party of Kenya ticket.Vihiga MP Yusuf Chanzu is also in the race on the ANC ticket. He, too, has not named his running mate. Jubilee aspirant Shera Didi said he will soon unveil his number two, but assured his supporters of a female deputy.Akaranga, Chanzu and Didi are from the Maragoli community. Ottichilo is a Bunyore.Out of the three main communities in the county, the Tirikis are likely to produce all the running mates because they do not have a candidate for the seat.
