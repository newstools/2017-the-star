What we saw were not elections. It was a free-for-all exercise that was called elections,&rdquo; Kamau said.HooligansNgaruiya yesterday said elections in Kahawa West were infiltrated by the outlawed Mungiki sect who did allow the residents to freely exercise their democratic right.&ldquo;The party allowed hooligans, Mungiki, to run the elections. How can someone expect us to take that?&rdquo; he said on the phone.Ngaruiya said despite being promised a free and fair process by the party headquarters, the primaries was shambolic.&ldquo;You can imagine we paid Sh100,000 for the primaries. Then the money we spent on campaigns, just for someone to bungle the elections,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;The Elections Appeals Board was not helpful either. They acknowledged there were problems, but still referred us to the High Court.&ldquo;Politicians have been slaves of political parties for a very long time. We are saying enough is enough.&rdquo;The MCAs said they have formed a strong political force and warned parties to prepare for an epic battle.
