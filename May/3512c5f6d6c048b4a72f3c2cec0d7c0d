Coast governors have faulted the process ollowed in the appointment of new Coast Water Services Board CEO Jacob Kimutai.Mombasa&rsquo;s Hassan Joho, Kilifi&rsquo;s Amason Kingi and Taita Taveta&rsquo;s John Mruttu on Wednesday accused the national government of dictating the leadership of the CWSB.&ldquo;Three applicants Kimutai, Florence Birya and David Birya were successful during the interview by Deloitte and Touche and their names forwarded to the Board,&rdquo; Kingi said.&ldquo;Birya was the best from the three interviewed. She was also the only woman, an added advantage, and she is from the Coast region.&ldquo;However, the Jubilee administration decided that Kimutai, who came third during the interviews, and is not even from the Coast, should be appointed the CEO.&rdquo;Kimutai replaced Joseph Omwange, who headed the board in an acting capacity for 17 months.Kingi said Kimutai&rsquo;s appointment was orchestrated by forces within Jubilee&rsquo;s inner circle.&ldquo;Why Kimutai? Who is behind his appointment,&rdquo; he said.Kingi said Kimutai was sacked by his former employer and does not deserve to head the CWSB.
