NASA supporters in Kakamega and Vihiga counties have asked UDP leader Cyrus Jirongo to stop giving conditions to flagbearer Raila Odinga over the alliance lineup.Jirongo on Thursday said he had given Raila an offer if he wants him to join NASA. &ldquo;If he doesn&rsquo;t return with convincing answers I will mobilise resources and run for president,&rdquo; Jirongo told the Star on the phone.Likuyani MP Enock Kibunguchy and MCAs in Vihiga led by Ben Ombima said Jirongo likes creating confusion every election time, and he risks becoming politically irrelevant if he continues.Kibunguchy said Jirongo should know no single person can win the presidency without the support of others.He told Jirongo to stop criticising ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and his Ford Kenya counterpart Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula for backing Raila.&ldquo;What we know is that Mudavadi and Wetang&rsquo;ula have finally achieved Luhya unity under NASA and any attack on them is an attack to the community,&rdquo; Kibunguchy said.Ombima asked Raila to ignore Jirongo&rsquo;s demands.
