Wiper party officials have cautioned the Jubilee administration against executing witch-hunt schemes against NASA leaders.They said the order to freeze Kalonzo Musyoka Foundation's accounts borders on a plot to intimidate the opposition.Lamu Woman Rep Shakilla Abdalla, also Wiper deputy leader, said the NGO Coordination Board's action showed Jubilee is scared.She told journalists in Malindi that there are forces within government who are trying to fight Kalonzo ahead of August.The board says the charitable trust received Sh50 million from China that could not be traced.It said this was part of Sh146 million that the organisation could not account for, hence the shut order.Read: Kalonzo Foundation shut over Sh146m unaccounted cashKalonzo, in a press conference, said he was yet to be served the letter from the NGO board."This document was only shared with the media. The Chinese did not give money but brought materials."[AUDIO] Kalonzo links Uhuru's 'number two' to foundation woes, says Fazul must resignShakilla said Jubilee was only keen on distabilising NASA from winning the scheduled presidential poll."The suspension of the foundation&rsquo;s accounts is a clear indication that NASA leaders are being targeted," she said.She cited the case where bank accounts of Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho were frozen 'following orders from above'."Why they are doing it selectively? It was Joho and now they are on Kalonzo. We do not know who is next.""Jubilee has only sensed defeat in the August 8 polls. They should prepare that NASA will beat them," she said.&nbsp;Shakilla asked the NGOs board director Fazul Mohamed to be cautious about being used by Jubilee leaders to intimidate NASA members.Kalonzo is in NASA alongside Raila Odinga, Musalia Mudavadi, Isaac Rutto, and Moses Wetang'ula."Fazul should use his office as per the law," the legislator said.Also read: State using NGOs board to intimate Kalonzo, weaken NASA - Kibwana&nbsp;&nbsp;
