Former Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth has ditched Jubilee Party and announced that he will vie for Nairobi governor as an independent candidate.Kenneth, who was floored by Senator Mike Sonko, said the primaries were shambolic and that there was no response on the malpractice concerns he raised with the party."There were cases of ballot stuffing and non-members taking part in the nominations. In short, the elections were stolen," he said on Friday.He added that the 93 appeals out of a possible 105 seats contested during the nominations was an indication of rigging.Read: Peter Kenneth appeals Sonko win, refuses to concede defeatMore on this: Infiltration of 'outsiders' cause of names missing in Jubilee registers - officialThe aspirant said he will unveil his running mate next week for the race against Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko (Jubilee) and ODM's Evans Kidero."Sonko lacks material skills to manage a city that controls 60 per cent of the GDP," he told journalists.He further said the Senator has failed to oversight Kidero&rsquo;s leadership and that this hampered service delivery.Kenneth said incumbent Kidero is a manager who has failed and does not deserve another term at the city's helm."Very few Nairobians can show what Kidero has done despite being allocated over Sh100 billion over the four years he was in office," he said."I will address the problems city residents are grappling with. Nairobians' only two options are choosing between the bad and the ugly. But now they have a mature leader with intact integrity and track record."He further noted "Nairobi needs a CEO who will not only manage but be able to implement".Kidero will also face Miguna Miguna who is also an independent candidate.
