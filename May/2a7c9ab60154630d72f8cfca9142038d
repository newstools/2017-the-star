The East Africa Community has asked the European Union not to punish Kenya by rejecting agricultural products exported to Europe.The heads of state Summit in Dar es Salaam resolved to petition the EU on behalf of Kenya.The team dispatched Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni, the new EAC chairman, to present Kenya's case.President Museveni said his first assignment is to harmonise the EAC&rsquo;s position on the Economic Partnership Agreement.Their bid is for countries in the region to be allowed to export its agricultural products to Europe without attracting tax.Museveni told the 18th Ordinary Summit on Saturday that EAC was committed to solving the EU-EAC stalemate over EPA.Kenya was represented at the meeting by Deputy President William Ruto on behalf of President Uhuru Kenyatta.The Ugandan leader, however, warned EU against punishing Kenya yet it has already signed the agreement."I want to assure this Summit that my first assignment is to lead a delegation to Brussels, Belgium, in my capacity as new chairman.""We will give our stand on the matter as well as ask them not to punish Kenya on the matter as we come up with a lasting solution to the problem," he said."We object any move by EU to harm Kenya as far as EU-EAC issues are concerned. What we mean is that Kenya should not be disadvantaged since the country has already signed the agreement," Museveni added.Tanzanian President John Pombe Magufuli, who is also the former immediate EAC chairman, was present.Presidents Paul Kagame (Rwanda,), Salva Kiir (South Sudan) and Pierre Nkurunziza (Burundi) were also represented at the Summit.The meetings' theme was &lsquo;towards sustainable growth and development of the community&rsquo;.Kenya&rsquo;s Cabinet Secretaries Phyllis Kandie (East African Affairs) and Aden Mohammed (Industrialisation) also travelled with Ruto to Dar es Salaam.MPs Kimani Ichungwa (Kikuyu), Muthomi Njuki (Igamba Ngombe), Joyce Lay (Women Rep, Taita Taveta), Abdulraman Hassan (Wajir) and Leonard Sang (Bureti) accompanied them.Museveni took over the leadership of EAC Summit from Magufuli who has been chairman since 2015.He said EAC integration was about prosperity, security, and unity of all citizens in the region.Earlier, during a closed session, Ruto asked EAC governments to urgently address non-tariff barriers that have become the stumbling block to cross-border trade in the region.The DP said it was essential for the respective governments to boost movement of goods and manpower as well as address the fundamental issues posed by the restrictions.He said: "Unless EAC governments work together in addressing challenges facing the region, the gains which have been made so far could be eroded."Ruto said there was no need for EAC governments to engage in activities aimed at undermining and blocking each other."While we fight and block each other, our businesses are struggling and our import bills is growing.""We need to stop this misdirected competition that only benefits outsiders. We started well and we need to keep the promise to our people," he said.President Magufuli said although he did not find a lasting solution to the EU-EAC trade deal, he expressed optimism that the issue would soon be solved."Although I didn&rsquo;t find a lasting solution to the EU-EAC trade deal, I am optimistic that the new chairman will solve the impasse with the support of all of us," Magufuli said.He said unity remains key to the success of EAC integration."For us to achieve the goals of EAC, we must unite and work as a team in solving the problems facing this region as well as accelerating the integration process."Museveni said EAC was committed to solving insecurity challenges being witnessed in South Sudan and Burundi.
