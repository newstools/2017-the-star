Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero and Senator Mike Sonko have renewed their war to clear mountains of garbage.The county government has warned against unauthorised garbage collectors after the Sonko Rescue Team carried out a campaign called &ldquo;Operation Ngarisha Jiji&rdquo;.County secretary Robert Ayisi said only service providers who follow the correct procedure will be allowed to collect garbage.He said anyone found collecting garbage without following the conditions set by the county government will be breaking rules.&ldquo;We do not mind anyone collecting garbage, but they should follow the procedure that meets the county conditions and that of the National Environment Management Authority by having the right licences,&rdquo; Ayisi said.He said garbage collectors should also register their garbage trucks.Ayisi said the city always partners with other organisations, but will not allow people who dump garbage somewhere at night and then collect it later in the name of cleaning.
