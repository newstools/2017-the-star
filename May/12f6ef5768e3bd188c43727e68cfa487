Gospel singer Daniel Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a Heho, popularly known as Hey Z Da Brand, recently opened up about how he&rsquo;s coping after splitting with his wife in September last year. In a recent interview with Word Is, the Kisogo hit maker said he&rsquo;s doing just fine, while subtly implying that he has found a new catch.When asked what exactly happened between him parting ways and his wife Mercy Njoki, a former Tahidi High actress, Hey Z told this writer that such is part of life."Whatever happened, happened. Everyone is happy where they are. I don't want to go into much details because I believe I should not discuss anything about the mother of my son," he stated.A few days ago, Hey Z shared some photos that showed him having a good time with a certain woman in the Coastal region. However, he insisted that she&rsquo;s just a good friend of his.
