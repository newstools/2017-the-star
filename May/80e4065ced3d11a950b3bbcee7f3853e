Starehe MP Maina Kamanda has accused Jubilee Party secretary general Raphael Tuju of plotting to rig him out of the primaries.He said Tuju has recruited his allies into powerful positions in the party, and they are pocketing money from aspirants in exchange for tickets.&ldquo;We are seeing there is a plot here by one or two people. Friday night, there was a recount of votes that was done without involving the appeals board and with only one aspirant present,&rdquo; Kamanda said.On Thursday last week, he was declared the winner of the JP Starehe primaries against his rival Charles Njagua, popularly known as Jaguar.The MP garnered 10,374 votes against Njagua&rsquo;s 8,391. Njagua has disputed the results and has been camping at JP headquarters with his supporters, demanding he be declared the winner.He claimed the votes were rigged in favour of the incumbent. The popular singer declined to negotiate with the MP or go back for repeat elections.Addressing journalists at Jubilee headquarters in Pangani yesterday, Kamanda said the nominations were marred by irregularities.He said the poll was open to all as non-party members cast their ballots and some people were ferried from outside the constituency and the county to vote for specific candidates.Kamanda said the party risks losing many seats on August 8, if the trend continues, because those who voted during primaries were ODM members.&ldquo;Most of the people who voted are ODM members. In August, they will go and vote for their candidates and the party will lose,&rdquo; he said.The legislator warned Tuju to stop interfering with Starehe and Nairobi politics or he will mobilise supporters to eject him from the office.&ldquo;And we want to tell Tuju, please, do not get involved in Starehe politics. There is someone here called Ambassador McOduol.&ldquo;He is the person interfering with Starehe politics. He is working day and night to rig me out. He has been brought in by Tuju because he was working with him when he was minister for Foreign Affairs,&rdquo; Kamanda said.
