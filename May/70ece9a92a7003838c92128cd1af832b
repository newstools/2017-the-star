Starring: Dwayne Johnson, Zac Efron, Alexandra Daddario, Kelly Rohrbach, Jon Bass, Priyanka ChopraDirected by: Seth GordonPremier: 25th May 2017Anyone who grew up in the '90s remembers Pamela Anderson&rsquo;s legendary slow run on the beach to the soundtrack of Baywatch. As is Hollywood&rsquo;s biggest trend, the '90s drama has been turned into a blockbuster starring all the hottest A-list celebrities. Mitch Buchanan, the head lifeguard, is less than happy when Matt, a washed-up athlete, is recruited into his squad. But when a dead body is recovered from their part of the ocean, the two have to work together to put an end to the drug-related criminal activities happening on their turf. The film is nothing short of a good time. Sexy bodies, skimpy swim suits and bad language make up most of the story plot.Star rating: 3 stars
