Nominated MP Oburu Oginga has allegedly threatened to commit suicide if Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo is given the ODM nominations certificate.This is according to Midiwo, who said his cousin Oburu declared the certificate will be issued "over his dead body".Oburu did not answer calls and messages for comment on the claim.Elisha Odhiambo won the nominations by 13,000 votes while Midiwo came second with 9,000 votes but the latter dismissed the results saying the exercise was not transparent.Read: Midiwo suffers humiliating defeat in Gem, Elisha Odhiambo wins ODM ticketMidiwo, who is National Assembly deputy minority leader, claimed the Nominated MP warned his younger brother Raila Odinga against intervening in the primaries dispute.&ldquo;Oburu maintained that plans to for the certificated to be handed to me will not happen,&rdquo; he told The Star by phone on Sunday.Midiwo said ODM leader Raila invited him to Nairobi to present his case to the Political Parties Disputes Tribunal. He said he did so but has not received feedback in over a week and that Elisha Odhiambo, Oburu's ally who was declared winner, has the certificate.The legislator further implicated Oburu saying Gem returning officer Willis Anayo was under "strict instructions from above" to ensure Odhiambo was declared winner.Midiwo said Anayo violated election rules and that Odhiambo was given a provisional certificate before vote counting had been completed.&ldquo;I was not given any document to sign, either conceding defeat or accepting it. Anayo left in his vehicle in a huff,&rdquo; he said.Odhiambo said he was legally declared the winner of the exercise by the returning officer and that he had no cause for worry.&ldquo;The only person mandated to read the results is the returning officer and he was there. This election was not about Jakoyo but about the people of Gem,&rdquo; he said in a press conference at Serena Hotel in Nairobi on Saturday.More on this: I will win Gem MP seat, ODM nominee Elisha Odhiambo saysAlso read: Jakoyo does not have ODM certifi cate for Gem MP, winner Odhiambo saysThe IEBC cleared Midiwo to vie as an independent candidate."If I cannot get justice because of Oburu, I will defend my seat on an independent,&rdquo; he said, but noted he will campaign for Raila as he has no problem with him.Midiwo said he and Siaya governor aspirant Nicholas Gumbo (Rarieda) will campaign aggressively "to expose Oburu&rsquo;s persistent underhand deals that have cost ODM".He said they will ensure the Nominated MP is kicked out of the political scene as "he should retire instead of creating unnecessary divisions among party enthusiasts".Gumbo and Siaya woman representative aspirant Florence Aluodo announced they will vie as independent candidates and asked their rivals to brace for a fierce battle.The Rarieda MP lost the governor election to Cornel Rasanga while Aluodo lost the woman MP race to Christine Ombaka.
