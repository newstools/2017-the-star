Mbita North MP Millie Odhiambo yesterday urged independent candidates to ensure the dream of NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga comes true.Speaking to the Star on the phone, Millie said although the law bars Raila from campaigning for the independent candidates, they should ensure he garners the maximum vote, especially in his strongholds. &ldquo;The law does not allow the independent candidates to associate themselves with any symbol or name associated with NASA and that will automatically lead to a disqualification from vying for any seat,&rdquo; Odhiambo said.&ldquo;However, the independent candidates are free to campaign for Raila&rsquo;s presidency.&rdquo; There is a battle between ODM candidates from Nyanza awarded the party certificates and those claiming they were short-changed and going independent.
