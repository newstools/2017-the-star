From drought to flood, the story of Kenya's water situation took its usual cyclical turn in the last few weeks.Most parts of Kenya have received the highest amounts of rainfall since the year began.Sadly, most of this rainwater continues to be allowed to escape as run-off and storm drain water.It is time we made serious investments in tanks and other water-harvesting technologies.A decent sized water tank is enough to cushion a family for months after the rains. There are testimonies of families that cut down their water bills by utilising rainwater harvested from their roofs.The price of water tanks remains prohibitive for most middle-to-low-income homes. A 10,000-litre tank costs Sh83,000, a tall order for a family that still has to contend with rising food prices.Finance CS Henry Rotich should consider lifting sales tax on tanks to encourage installation of bigger capacities.The county governments should encourage owners of new buildings to ensure their construction approval plans include water harvesting and storage systems.
