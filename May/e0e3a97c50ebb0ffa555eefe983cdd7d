Days after the state lifted night fishing ban that had been in existence for more than six years in Lamu, fishermen now want their Somali counterparts stopped from invading their market and selling their produce in Kenya. The fishermen (pictured) say the current market competition between them and the Somalis, is the main reason why fish prices have plummeted. The Somali fishermen have been selling their catch at extremely low prices. They said there is need for Kenyan and Somali fishermen to stick to their respective markets. They said they are worried the trend might lead to the total collapse of the sector. &ldquo;If the competition is not taken care of, we can as well forget there is fishing in Lamu. We propose that each one sticks to marketing their produce in their countries,&rdquo; resident Mohamed Ali said. On Labour Day, the government lifted the ban that barred fishermen from fishing at night. The ban was imposed in 2011, following kidnappings of fishermen and tourists by al Shabaab militants.
