A businessman is challenging Energy CS Charles Keter (pictured) ban of importation of petroleum gas through any route other than Kipevu Oil. The ban was announced on April 18.Muriuki Gikundi wants the decision quashed, saying it was made unilaterally and without notice to the public.It restricts all petroleum product imports, including liquefied petroleum gas, to be made through the Kipevu oil storage facility, the Shimanzi oil terminal, the Miritini Import terminal and the Kenya Petroleum Refineries and Changamwe, Mombasa. The court heard that under Petroleum Rules of 2012, liquefied petroleum gas, bitumen and fuel oil are exempt from restrictions regarding importation. Gikundi says the decision is illegal and unsustainable in a country that regards highly the rule of law and constitutionalism as one of its leading values.
