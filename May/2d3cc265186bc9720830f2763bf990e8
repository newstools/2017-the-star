So, this has to be followed."He called on President Uhuru Kenyatta to accept defeat if the NASA team beats Jubilee Party in the poll.Raila pledged to also abide by the decision of Kenyans further asking IEBC to keep the players in the election engaged and informed."I am confident that we will stop the rigging. We will accept the results of an election devoid of rigging. All we ask Kenyans is to be peaceful during this electioneering period," he said.The ODM leader pledged to increase devolved funds by up to 45% of the national revenue within their first 90 days in office."We also work hard to bring down the cost of essential commodities to ease the cost of living. We will also vet state officers to minimise wastage and ensure funds are utilised well."Further, on the war against corruption, Raila pledged to improve institutions mandated to fight the vice and also ensure they provide leadership that is committed to cause."NASA will ensure it secures convictions for people involved in corruption since the evidence exists in most of the cases," he said.
