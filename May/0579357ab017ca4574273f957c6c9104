WHETHER or not to reside at State House is purely the decision of an incumbent President.Technically speaking, State House is the official residence of the First Family - that is where they reside and where the President runs the affairs of the nation from.The State does not have other homes where the President and his or her family may live, other than the designated State Houses and Lodges.The decision by President Uhuru not to reside within the State House compound is well within his choice.In any case, his home is just a stone&rsquo;s throw away from State House and he can easily walk over without causing any challenges such as traffic jams when he is on the move. The front side of State House, Nairobi, has several offices of the President where he transacts the State's business and he can also hold informal meetings there. Behind the offices is where the residence of the President and his/her family is located. The residence is a restricted area in State House, where only authorised persons are allowed access.My former boss, retired President Daniel Moi, opted to perform his office work at State House, but he resided at his Kabarnet Gardens residence, where he would also hold both official and non-official meetings.Even when he was at Kabarnet Gardens, I would still provide for him housekeeping and catering staff and other services.President Uhuru's father and Founding President Jomo Kenyatta had a special preference for Mombasa and Nakuru, while Moi had a strong preference for Nairobi&rsquo;s State House and his private city residence at Kabarnet Gardens.Mzee Kenyatta also preferred commuting to work from Gatundu.In the early days of his presidency, Mzee Kenyatta worked from Harambee House and State House. He would also receive his delegations either at his Gatundu home or at the Mombasa and Nakuru State Houses.Moi, on the other hand, held court at Kabarnet Gardens and he also liked operating from Nakuru State House, which was popular with people seeking the President&rsquo;s ear out of Nairobi.The Third President, Mwai Kibaki, who took over in 2002, preferred operating from Nairobi, occasionally transacting business from Harambee House within the CBD. Kibaki also not only operated from State House Nairobi but resided there, although he at times visited Mombasa. But he stayed away from other State Houses and Lodges.
