Elgeyo Marakwet Governor Alex Tolgos has urged Deputy Governor Gabriel Lamaon to continue working until August 8. Tolgos dropped Lamaon for his new running mate Wesley Rotich. On Saturday Lamaon said he was surprised Tolgos picked a running mate without informing him. He said he was too embarrassed to go to the office. But on Tuesday Tolgos said he bears no grudge against Lamaon and asked him to go to Iten and continue working with him until the end of their first term. He dismissed reports that he dropped Lamaon because he did not help him win more votes in his Kipsoen, Keiyo North, backyard. “It was good working with Lagat in my first term as governor. He was a very cooperative person and we never had squabbles at it happens in other counties,” Tolgos said. Last Friday, Tolgos said he selected director of cooperatives Rotich to give a chance to the marginalised Kiptani community. “Most people only know of the Marakwet, Keiyo and Sengwer communities in Elgeyo Marakwet. But in Keiyo North we have a smaller group called the Kiptani and he [Rotich] comes from that community. In my government everybody is given an opportunity,” he said.
