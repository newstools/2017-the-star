NASA has dragged three local mobile phone service providers into fresh demands to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to ensure transparency and accountability in poll results transmission. Yesterday, it demanded that Safaricom, Airtel and Telkom guarantee and provide to the IEBC encrypted Sim cards that will protect their transmission systems from hacking.&ldquo;The IEBC must ensure all Sim cards and their associated IMEIs are registered in accordance with the requirements of Sim card registration regulations from the Communications Authority of Kenya and made available for inspection by all political parties with presidential candidates,&rdquo; Pentagon member Musalia Mudavadi said in a statement.&ldquo;The elections laws require transmission of presidential election results from polling stations to tallying centres be done by electronic means.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the responsibility of the commission to ensure achievement of this legal requirement without any alterations whatsoever.&ldquo;NASA wishes to bring to the attention of the commission the looming danger of not achieving electronic transmission as required by law.&rdquo;This means each polling station should receive an allocation of only one number.Mudavadi said the IEBC must apply to the CA for allocation of numbers unique to each zone &mdash; each with its own mobile destination code.NASA wants the IEBC to zone the country and distribute polling stations equally to the three operators.The operators must also use hybrid technologies to deliver an all-round electronic transmission of results. The alliance wants all players involved in the zoning process.&ldquo;All providers must, in their contracts, clearly state that no more than one Sim card shall be provided for the same number,&rdquo; Mudavadi said, urging the IEBC to implement the proposals. The statement added, &ldquo;NASA is aware that the 3G network is the technology with the capacity to transmit results with the required quality, speed and precision expected by voters.&rdquo;
