Jamii Telecommunications yesterday termed as disinformation, a story that it was allocated a licence to operate mobile phone service for a fraction of the fees paid by Safaricom, Airtel and Orange.And Communications Authority, which was accused of issuing the licence for Sh100,000 instead of Sh2.5 billion, said the public had not lost any money as alleged, and promised to issue a comprehensive statement later.&ldquo;Contrary to what appeared in the media today, the Authority wishes to clarify that no money has been lost in the authorisation to Jamii Telecom,&rdquo; CA chairman Ngene Gituku said. Jamii Telecomm&rsquo;s CEO and chairman Joshua Chepkwony clarified that it had been given a trial licence for which it paid Sh15 million to test its equipment and service. He said if the trial is successful, JTL will be upgraded to a Tier 1 service provider like Safaricom, Airtel and Orange, and will then be required to pay the Sh2.5 billion if it gets the licence.The Daily Nation yesterday published a story in which some of the telecom players questioned the criteria used to award the licence. Chepkwony said some of the players in the sector were trying to block his company from becoming the fourth provider. &ldquo;We must state from the onset that we have no doubt that the report is not a product of objective journalistic investigation and reporting but rather is the product of machinations and intrigues by dominant actors in the telecommunication industry who are keen on protecting their monopolistic dominance from the entrance of new actors,&rdquo; Chepkwony said in a statement. Tier 2 operators like JTL are required to pay Sh100,000 for the grant of operating licence while tier 1, which includes Safaricom, Airtel and Orange pay Sh2.5 billion. &ldquo;Jamii telecommunications Ltd applied to the CA for a 4G/LTE licence on the 700MHz. After due scrutiny, JTL was granted a trial licence which will only be converted to a full licence after fulfillment of set authorised terms and conditions including payment of Sh2.5 billion spectrum fees,&rdquo; he said.The media reported that Jamii Telecom, known for its Faiba brand, had been given a go-ahead to operate mobile phone services with prefix 0747 on trial basis.
