Security forces in Laikipia county have recovered two rifles from herders and arrested four suspects in the ongoing operation to flush out illegal grazers from private ranches. County commissioner Onesmus Musyoki, regular police officers and some Kenya Defence Forces soldiers were patrolling Ol Maisor Ranch on Wednesday evening when they nabbed the armed suspects.&ldquo;Security officers ordered the four armed men to surrender and they obliged. They were arrested and two AK47 rifles with 29 rounds of ammunition were recovered,&rdquo; Musyoki said yesterday.The county commissioner said the four will appear in court today to answer to charges of illegal possession of firearms and trespassing on a private land.&ldquo;I call on those still possessing illegal firearms to surrender them immediately to security officers before the law catches up with them. We know there are morans who still carry guns as they graze animals and they are now the target of security officers,&rdquo; Musyoki said.The state official said hundreds of pastoralists who had invaded private ranches have been driven out, while others left on their own volition following the onset of rains.Musyoki said calm is slowly returning on the ranches that had been invaded by the illegal herders. Only a few grazers from the Laikipia county are remaining.
