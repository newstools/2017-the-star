Kiambu Governor William Kabogo has denied he has ever insulted women, in fact, he cherishes them and respects them.But just in case anyone has the wrong impression, he&rsquo;s really sorry.Kabogo was defeated in a landslide by Ferdinand Waititu for the Jubilee governor&rsquo;s ticket. He says the poll was unfair plans to run as an independent.Kabogo will need women&rsquo;s votes and he&rsquo;s now on a charm offensive.&ldquo;If I wronged anyone, then I politely ask for forgiveness because we all need each other in the long run,&rdquo; he said.Kabogo got 69,916 votes against Waititu&rsquo;s 353,604.Many observers said factors in his defeat were his arrogant leadership style and his disparaging remarks about women. He says he was rigged out. Kabogo&rsquo;s chopper has flown so low that women&rsquo;s skirts swirled above their thighs. Just an accident. He is said to have promised to buy them all panties and give them money if they voted for him &mdash; because their husbands can&rsquo;t afford to buy underwear for them. Kabogo allegedly said single women were unfit to hold office because they abandoned their matrimonial obligations. Not true. These are just a few of what he called malicious lies spread by his adversaries. He tried to set the record straight on Citizen TV on Monday and Radio Jambo and the Star on Wednesday. &ldquo;They said I insulted women whom I treasure and respect. They can&rsquo;t substantiate the allegations,&rdquo; he told Radio Jambo. &ldquo;No one can table evidence on all the lies peddled against me. I&rsquo;ve never insulted women in Kiambu or anywhere else. I hold them highly. The allegations were just political. My competitors would not get any other avenue from which to attack me,&rdquo; he said.He said he helped women in many ways. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve served women diligently and with all the energy. I&rsquo;ve built hospitals in every ward, helped them form and finance women&rsquo;s groups for their growth,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;This is not something that can be buried because everyone knows I&rsquo;m one of the top performing governors. I had no reason to be abusive. He expressed confidence he will defeat Waititu on August 8. On Monday he told Citizen TV he was rigged out through a well-orchestrated scheme by a senior party official.Kabogo did not name the official but added that he planned his downfall. &ldquo;I lodged a complaint at party headquarters that presiding officers were hired by my rival. I was told it would be looked into, nothing happened.&rdquo;
