The police have dismissed claims they are after Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko.This was after a letter reportedly issued by a Mombasa chief magistrate over warrants of his arrest started circulating on social media.The letter was dated April 21, 2017 and signed by A. Abubakar &mdash; the in-charge of the chief magistrate&rsquo;s criminal registry.Abubakar filed this through reference number MSA/CM/CR1/2, involving criminal file case numbers 950/1997, 951/1997, 630/1998 and 976/1998. The cases are between the Republic versus Mbuvi Gedion Kioko Kivanguli.He was responding to a letter from William Kenga and Advocates with reference number KC/CMCC NO2309/2012 dated April 11, 2017, in which he indicated two of the files are being traced. It was indicated that a warrant of arrest was issued.&ldquo;Currently, an exercise is ongoing to trace all requested files. Sorry for any inconvenience caused,&rdquo; the letter read.Police spokesperson George Kinoti told the Star that police are not after Sonko and the letter doing the rounds is nothing but propaganda.&ldquo;We are the ones who are supposed to spearhead this if the warrants were in force. No one is after Sonko,&rdquo; he said.The Star established from Shimo La Tewa prisons that Sonko was arrested in late 1997 and escaped in 1998 to attend the burial of his late mother Saumu Mukami Mbuvi.He was re-arrested in 1999 and set free in 2000 from the Kamiti Prison.Investigating officer Munga Nyale, then-officer in charge of the Flying Squad and currently head of the Anti-Terrorism Police Unit, told the Star on the phone that Sonko has no case.&ldquo;We probed his case with various police agencies and didn&rsquo;t find anything. The court ruled in his favour.&rdquo;
