Wiper has settled on Jackson Kala to run for Machakos senator.He was issued with the party&rsquo;s certificate on Wednesday evening after Senator Johnson Muthama said he will not defend his seat.Speaking to the Star on the phone yesterday, Wiper National Elections Board chairperson Agatha Solitei said the decision was made because the party did not want to miss a candidate for the position. &ldquo;If you are aware, the deadline for all political parties to submit their candidates to the IEBC was on Wednesday and Muthama had already given out his position, we decided to give the certificate to Kala,&rdquo; she said.Solitei downplayed any room for further negotiations with Muthama, saying the position of the board was that Kala be the candidate. Muthama is at liberty to lodge an appeal.
