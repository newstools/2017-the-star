A form three student was burned beyond recognition on Friday after a boys&rsquo; dormitory caught fire at Bar Kowino secondary school in Bondo.The student, who is said to have fallen ill, was sleeping in the dormitory together with his two other colleagues when the fire broke out.Principal John Mboga said the other two students sustained injuries as they fled from the flames whose spark is yet to be established."They alerted other students who were in class at that time."He said the students, assisted by the school's neighbours, tried to put out the fire in vain since it had engulfed the entire block."The boy was trapped inside the building. We tried to save him but it was unfortunate he passed on," Mboga said.The principal stated that the student burnt as his colleagues and members of the public who were trying to put out the fire helplessly watched.Bondo OCPD Paul Kiarie said the body is lying at the Bondo sub-county hospital mortuary awaiting postmortem."We are conducting investigations to ascertain the cause of the fire," Kiarie said.Siaya deputy governor Wilson Ouma Onyango visited the scene.The incident happened on the same day a task force assigned to study school fires handed over its report to the Ministry of Education.The team found out that political interference, peer pressure, indiscipline and pressure on students to score good grades sparked the fires.Dr Gracie Mulei, a member of the task force, cited lack of intelligence gathering mechanisms and mismanagement of school resources as another cause.She also pointed out that too many exams also pushed students in most of the affected schools to burn down learning facilities. The team told Education CS Fred Matiang'i at the KICD on Thursday that widespread use of mobile phones amongst students and congested dormitories is also to blame.Sensational media reporting also promoted the vice, the task force said in their findings.More on this: Politics, incitement and students' peer pressure sparked school fires &ndash; report
