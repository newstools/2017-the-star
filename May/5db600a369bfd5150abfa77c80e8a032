Knut national treasurer John Matiang&rsquo;i wants the Nyamira governor seat to be held on rotational basis by leaders from the county&rsquo;s four constituencies. &ldquo;For equitable distribution of infrastructure, jobs and for general development,&rdquo; he said. Nyamira county is comprised of Borabu, North Mugirango, West Mugirango and North Mugirango constituencies.Matiang&rsquo;i said incumbent John Nyagarama comes from West Mugirango, and therefore his successor should hail from Kitutu Masaba. He proposed in 2022 the governor should come from Borabu, and in 2027 from North Mugirango. The two governor hopefuls from Kitutu Masaba are former MPs Walter Nyambati of Jubilee Party and PDP&rsquo;s Mwancha Okioma. The duo have each served as MPs for five years. Speaking to the Star on the phone yesterday, Matiang&rsquo;i appeared to endorse Okioma.
