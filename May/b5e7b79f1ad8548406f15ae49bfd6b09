The battle for Kwale top seat has taken shape, with all major political parties eyeing the seat. The incumbent Salim Mvurya will seek reelection on a Jubilee ticket. He will face off with Wiper's Chirau Kwakwere and Issa Chepera of ODM. Sammy Ruwa who was floored by Chepera during the ODM primaries is also in the race as an independent candidate. Another aspirant Gereza Dena, who also lost in the ODM nominations will also be on the ballot. He claimed that the primaries were not transparent. The divisions in the opposition coalition are likely to give governor Mvurya an upper hand in the August polls. Mvurya said he is backing on the development track record of the Jubilee administration like the tarmacking of Samburu-Kinango road. He said the renovations of  Msambweni referral hospital and Kinango hospital are other major projects done by Jubilee. "Jubilee has helped us equip Msambweni referral hospital with modern equipment among them the renal unit and construct a modern ICU, X-ray room among others," Mvurya said. The governor comes from the Duruma community which is the second largest tribe in the region. Msambweni MP independent aspirant Omar Boga said that major parties including ODM will most likely not have majority representatives in the county assembly. "Many of those left out in party primaries were rigged out but have the support of voters. Therefore expect a majority of independent MCAs in the county assembly," he said. Others Jubilee aspirants in the region are women representative Zainab Chizuga and Fatuma Tabwara of Party for Development and Reforms. Jubilee Senator Mshenga Ruga is expected to face it off with Ford Kenya's Ibrahim Bulushi and ODM's Issa Boy.
