Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho yesterday named his running mate William Kingi, a university don described by his colleagues as a fearless and principled man. The 47-year-old Kingi’s acceptance speech was punctuated by statements of intent, which portray him as cut from the same cloth as Joho. “Coming here to issue one or two title deeds does not solve the land question,” Kingi said in reference to the President issuing deeds in the county. In January 2016, President Uhuru Kenyatta in January issued thousands of title deeds to residents in Mombasa and other parts of the Coast, a move that was seen as a bid to get their support. Kingi seems to have borrowed a leaf from Joho, who has had several spats with Uhuru over land and other issues in Mombasa. The Human Resource Management PhD holder from Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology portrayed himself as a man determined to solve the long-standing land problems in Mombasa. “Cosmetic solutions to land issues will never work,” he said during his unveiling in Old Town. Political observers say the two will complement each other. Joho said his decision to pick Kingi as his running mate was influenced by his fearlessness. “Mombasa does not want a leader who can be intimidated,” he said. Joho’s pick for running mate is likely to further strain his relationship with the Jubilee administration. A confident Kingi said Mombasa residents will now decide whether they want a government anchored on devolution or one that will be taking instructions from Nairobi. “Hassan Ali Joho wants to make Mombasa the Dubai of Africa. We will achieve and realise Vision 2035 [the county's blueprint],” Kingi said. He is the dean of the School of Business at the Technical University of Mombasa. Joho’s aides have told the Star the governor picked Kingi with an eye on the 2022 presidential elections. “Joho has confidence in Kingi. He studied him well and followed his career for some time. He believes the don can handle the pressure of being branded an enemy of the state,” one of the governor’s aides said. Mombasa woman representative Mishi Mboko said the county will be in safe hands when Joho is campaigning for Presidency in 2022. Joho said he trusts Kingi to move Mombasa closer to the county’s Vision 2035 adding he knows he may not be around to deliver the vision to Mombasa residents. “Sometimes you need to think beyond politics. That is why I settled on a professional,” said Joho. He said Kingi will enable him mount a vigorous campaign for the presidency in 2022. In a statement that seems to be directed at his close allies Mombasa county secretary Francis Thoya and Education executive Tendai Lewa, Joho said nobody should feel betrayed. Thoya and Tendai were among the top candidates to be Joho’s running mate. Joho explained that he needed a professional who understands the Coast well and who will deliver the goals and aspirations of the Jumuiya ya Kaunti za Pwani. He said Mombasa has borne and continues to bear the brunt of land injustices and it needs leaders, such as he and Kingi, who can stand up to anybody. Kingi's former boss Prof Josephat Mwatela, the former TUM vice chancellor, described him as principled and a fearless go-getter. He said Kingi always fights for his and his people’s rights.
