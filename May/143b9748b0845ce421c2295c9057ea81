Some 420,000 refugees in northern Kenya will benefit from increased food aid provision, following a Sh517 million donation by China.The World Food Programme received the donation on Tuesday and it will be used to buy 9,000 tonnes of cereals and improve refugee welfare until July.Food rations were reduced in the last year due to limited donor funding.&ldquo;We welcome this critical contribution from China as WFP has struggled to provide adequate food to refugees living in camps in food-insecure northern Kenya due to insufficient funds,&rdquo; said Annalisa Conte, WFP&rsquo;s country director and representative for Kenya.Ambassador Liu Xianfa said, &ldquo;China has responded quickly to the appeals of the international community for support to all those affected by drought in Kenya and other African countries.&rdquo;
