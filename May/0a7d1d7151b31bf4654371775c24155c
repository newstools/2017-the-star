The Presidential nominations started yesterday, with NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga and running mate Kalonzo Musyoka presenting their papers, among other candidates.The NASA pair hit the ground running with a rally in Jacaranda Grounds, Dandora, Nairobi, a depressed area of the capital city&rsquo;s Eastlands badlands.It was a day of heightened political activity in the city, but no adverse incidents. Today will see President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto present their nomination papers to the IEBC. The partisan excitement and peaceful atmosphere of Sunday should continue to be the case all the way to the General Election and its results aftermath.Kenya is bigger than the sum of its parts and general elections come and go. The experience of freely choosing our leaders should be a dignified and safe one, not a matter of risking limb and life or livelihood and settlement.There should never again be displaced, injured or dead as a result of an election in this country.The official campaign time begun yesterday by the IEBC should preface Kenya&rsquo;s biggest, most credible and successful election.
