Jubilee leaders have accused NASA candidates Raila Odinga and Kalonzo Musyoka of having interests in the Sh5.4 trillion Mrima Hills minerals and Titanium being extracted by Base Titanium.Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya started the storm at Tiwi area in Kwale with the sensational claim that NASA leaders are only interested in the county because of the resources.Mvurya claimed the two leaders' agenda is being advanced by Kwale Wiper party governor aspirant Chirau Mwakwere. The aspirant has been accusing Mvurya of signing the licence for Base Titanium to extract minerals in the region.&ldquo;When you see people saying they are in NASA, don&rsquo;t celebrate because they want our resources. That is why Raila is interested in Mrima Hills while Kalonzo signed the licence for Base Titanium, (the then Tiomin Company) in 1997," he said."Mwakwere came to further their interests when he was the environment minister."The Governor vindicated himself saying he has never been involved in the signing of the licence by Mwakwere.He urged residents in Kwale to support President Uhuru Kenyatta's re-election since his administration has implemented various development projects.More on this: Kwale leaders in war of words over Base Titanium prospects at Mrima HillsMining CS Dan Kazungu defended Mvurya saying he did not sign any mining agreement as claimed by his critics. He dismissed the allegations as mere propaganda by the Opposition.He spoke on Tuesday when he toured Kwale county with Tourism CS Najib Balala to inspect Jubilee projects, including the construction of a Sh4.8 million dormitory at Tiwi Girls' Secondary School.Kazungu said the Opposition coalition has continued using Coast people for selfish interests.&ldquo;Spare Mvurya on this mineral licence propaganda since he has no power to issue a licence or sign one. I am the only person authorised to deal with such things," he said.The CS added that the ministry will introduce a Mineral Rights Fund (MRF) to benefit the community and the county government by creating job opportunities.&ldquo;It is through the introduction of this fund that wealth from the minerals will flow back to the community and the county government, each receiving 10 per cent and 20 per cent of the revenue collected respectively,&rdquo; he said.Kazungu also said the government has embarked on a plan to build three training institutions in Lunga Lunga, Msambweni and Kinango to breed Kenya&rsquo;s crop of mining experts.The ministry estimates that Kwale county alone contributed at least 58 per cent of revenue collected from the minerals.Balala said NASA leaders should be the last to speak about corruption as Kalonzo signed the mining agreement between Base Titanium and the government.In 2015, Balala cancelled Cortec&rsquo;s licence alongside 64 other firms and individuals to "weed out dormant and speculative mining firms".According to the CS, the licenses were revoked due to non performance, breach of approval conditions and non compliance to industry rules.More on this: Cortec's Mrima deal was a fraud - BalalaKwale Deputy Governor Fatuma Achani dismissed Mwakwere's claims on Mvurya saying he resorted to propaganda as he had nothing to offer.
