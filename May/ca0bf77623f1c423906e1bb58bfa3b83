The race for Nairobi governor is proving to be an interesting one to watch after former presidential candidate Peter Kenneth announced he will run for the seat as an independent.The former Gatundu MP was trounced by Senator Mike Sonko in the Jubilee primaries. Sonko had 138,185 votes against Kenneth's 62,504.Kenneth said he has ditched the ruling party because the JP nominations were not free and fair, but pledged to support President Uhuru Kenyatta's reelection.&ldquo;We had Jubilee nominations which were actually a sham,&rdquo; Kenneth said.&ldquo;I wrote on the same day that we had rejected the process for many reasons &mdash; circular voting, stuffing of ballots, non-members voting &mdash; and we believe that the elections were actually stolen.&rdquo;Addressing the press at his campaign headquarters in Westlands, Nairobi, Kenneth said the many appeals that were filed after the primaries were a clear indication that they were not credible.&ldquo;Out of a possible 105 seats that were contested, there were 93 appeals of those seats, which in itself is an indication of how badly the elections were organised and how well-rigged the elections were,&rdquo; he said.Kenneth will name his running mate next week. He will face off with incumbent Evans Kidero of ODM, Jubilee's Sonko and Miguna Miguna who will run as an independent.Former National Assembly Speaker Kenneth Marende is also said to be in the race.Kenneth attacked Kidero and Sonko, saying the two have proved incapable of running the city effectively. He said Kidero is a manager who has failed and does not deserve another term in office.&ldquo;We have had four years of Governor Evans Odhiambo Kidero, who has failed us. Despite being allocated more than Sh100 billion in the last four years, very few Nairobians can show what he has done,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;He completely abdicated his duties to his junior officers.&rdquo;Kenneth said Sonko has failed is his oversight role and does not have the managerial capacity and capability to run the city that controls almost 60 per cent of Kenya's GDP.&ldquo;We must continue to reject the lies that are being peddled. Lies that we have seen in the last couple of weeks that Nairobi can succeed with a governor who is a figurehead. Nairobi is the single largest economic centre of our country. It requires a good manager,&rdquo; he said.Kenneth said he is a leader with a proven record and pleaded with Nairobians to elect him on August 8.
