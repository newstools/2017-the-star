Ahead of Sunday's much-anticipated Mashemeji Derby pitting fierce rivals Gor Mahia and AFC Leopards, city Senator Mike Sonko ruffled a few feathers when he posted photos of himself donning a shirt bearing colours of the two arch rivals.In his post, Sonko described himself as a 'watermelon' soccer fan, distancing himself from taking sides, a move that didn't ogre well with a few football fans who saw it as a gimmick to win a few hearts in this election year.Reactions include:Job Masika: I know you want to be neutral ndio upate kura. But when it comes to mashemeji derby, you must choose sides!Paperboyrocks: No such thing, you have to pick a side and run with it. Derby does not recognise water melons.Jesseshadrack: Hio nguo ipasuliwe. You can't be Manchester United and Arsenal at the same time. Hatutaki siasa kwa ball.
