The national government will engage local administrators and other stakeholders to restore peace and promote tranquillity in Laikipia, county commissioner Onesmus Musyoki has said.He spoke yesterday in Nanyuki town at a peace forum convened by the Laikipia Peace Caravan.&ldquo;In addition to the ongoing joint operation of the Kenya Defence Forces, and regular and administration police in various private ranches in the region, we want to engage the chiefs, village elders and other stakeholders to eradicate the menace,&rdquo; Musyoki said.He said the tough terrain and vastness of the county have hindered security agencies from successfully pursuing the criminals.The Peace Caravan was initiated in December last year by professionals from the three neighbouring counties to stop private land invasions, cattle rustling and animosity among communities.Mark Lereruk and Godfrey Putunoi, the co-chairpersons of the caravan, said that much has been achieved since it was initiated, ranging from recovery of stolen livestock to peaceful coexistence.&ldquo;We first engaged elders from the Samburu and Maasai communities before realising that young men were the key people because it is they who engage in cattle rustling,&rdquo; Putunoi said.He added that in the next three months, they will engage private ranchers so that herders who still remain in the farms can move out.The conflicts have led to many deaths, injuries and destruction of property worth millions of shillings.
