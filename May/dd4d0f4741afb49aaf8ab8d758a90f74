Governor hopeful Peter Kenneth has dismissed claims he was paid off by incumbent Evans Kidero to split Jubilee votes in August.Kenneth will run for Nairobi governor as an independent. He said he decided on his own free will. Kenneth spoke during an interview on Citizen TV on Thursday.He said it is wrong to link his candidacy with tribal politics. &ldquo;Treat that as propaganda. I&rsquo;m not here to split anyone&rsquo;s vote. I came to the race independent-minded and I was not paid by Kidero to split anyone&rsquo;s vote. Kidero cannot afford me,&rdquo; Kenneth said.Kenneth said he had entered the race following &ldquo;shambolic&rdquo; JP nominaitons. Senator Mike Sonko won in a landslide. &ldquo;We could not get a legitimate candidate from those elections. I did not consult anybody, not even the President. I made the decision myself,&rdquo; he said.The former Gatanga MP defended his track record in institutions he worked for before entering politics.&ldquo;I am proud of my stint at Kenya Re. I led the company into the stock exchange. I am probably the only Kenya Football Federation chair who left money in the kitty,&rdquo; Kenneth said.Kenneth will announce his running mate next week.The former presidential candidate has complicated Jubilee&rsquo;s plan for DP William Ruto to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta in 2022, assuming he wins in August. &ldquo;I still support Uhuru&rsquo;s bid for a second term,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;There is a lot of pain for Nairobi residents. The city has been run down in the past four years.&rdquo;Kenneth said he quit Jubilee after it did not respond to complaints and evidence about primary malpractices.&ldquo;There were cases of ballot stuffing and non-members taking part in the nominations. He said 93 appeals on 105 positions indicated rigging.
