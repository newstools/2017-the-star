NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga has said Jubilee has failed to fulfil its promises and he is the &lsquo;Joshua&rsquo; needed to take Kenyans to the Promised Land.He will work to improve the &ldquo;dilapidated economy&rdquo; in his first 90 days if elected, and ensure secondary school education is free.Raila addressed rallies yesterday in Barwessa and Margat in Baringo North and South subcounties.&ldquo;This is what NASA promises, but not the empty promises given by the Jubilee government in the last five years,&rdquo; Raila said, adding that Jubilee, led by President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto have already conceded defeat.He linked Jubilee to &ldquo;high-level corruption, tribalism, a failed laptop project, failed maize floor, and insecurity&rdquo;.Raila said it is a shame to see Kenyans die of hunger and become displaced in their own country over 50 years after Independence. Yet, &ldquo;the government watches&rdquo;.He cited runaway insecurity instigated by armed bandits and cattle rustling in parts of Baringo, Laikipia, Turkana and Elgeyo Marakwet.&ldquo;I asked President Uhuru to explain to us why all this is happening under his watch and he anwered that he has tried, but has been defeated,&rdquo; Raila said.
