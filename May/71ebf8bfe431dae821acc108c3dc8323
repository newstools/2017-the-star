Senior Nakuru county officials on Tuesday suffered a major blow after the Labour and Employment Relations court declined to stop a case against them. County secretary Joseph Motari and Public Service management chief officer Philip Sigei are charged with illegal recruitment of 140 workers in 2014. The two had applied to have the court bar their prosecution, saying it is not within its jurisdiction. &ldquo;The matter touches on employment and it squarely falls in the jurisdiction of this court,&rdquo; Justice Stephen Radido said.An ad hoc committee said the county government lost Sh261 million through illegal hiring of workers. A report tabled in the Nakuru assembly had recommended the sacking of the two for illegal employment of workers between January and November 2015. Motari and Sigei had gotten a reprieve from the High Court in 2016 after the court restrained the governor from implementing the report.
