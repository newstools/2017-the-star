Democratic and Republican lawmakers will be "thanking" Donald Trump for firing FBI director James Comey, the president has said.In early morning tweets, Trump defended his bombshell decision to fire the FBI chief over his handling of the inquiry into Hillary Clinton's emails.Comey was leading an FBI investigation into alleged links between the Trump campaign and Russia.His removal has shocked Washington and Democrats are outraged.Read: FBI chief James Comey fired by TrumpThe sacking "raises profound questions about whether the White House is brazenly interfering in a criminal matter," said Adam Schiff, who is the highest ranked Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee.But the president stood by his actions on Wednesday morning, hours before a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov - his first with any Russian official since taking power."James Comey will be replaced by someone who will do a far better job, bringing back the spirit and prestige of the FBI," Trump said in defending his decision on Wednesday."Comey lost the confidence of almost everyone in Washington, Republican and Democrat alike. When things calm down, they will be thanking me!" he added.It is only the second time the head of the FBI has been fired.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov described Comey's dismissal as a US "internal affair" and it "has nothing to do and should have nothing to do with Russia", according to Russian state news agency TASS.Meanwhile, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he will request a closed and "if necessary, classified" all-senators separate briefing from senior Justice Department officials.He also called for a special prosecutor to oversee the FBI investigation into any potential Russian ties to Trump's associates.Why was James Comey fired?President Trump wrote in a letter to Comey that he agreed with Sessions' recommendation that "you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau".Sessions said the department of justice was "committed to a high level of discipline, integrity, and the rule of law", and "a fresh start is needed".Many have expressed surprise that Comey should be fired for his handling of the investigation into Clinton's emails, given that Trump often praised the FBI director's conduct in the matter.But on Tuesday, Trump followed the recommendation of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who wrote a letter saying he could not defend the director's handling of the investigation into Secretary Clinton.He added Comey had been wrong to "usurp" the previous attorney general in July 2016 when he announced the Clinton emails inquiry should be closed without prosecution.Comey was addressing FBI agents in Los Angeles when, according to US media, he learned he had just been fired when he saw the news on television.The 56-year-old - who was three-and-a-half years into his 10-year term as FBI director - reportedly laughed, thinking it was a prank.What about the Russia investigation?Democrats swiftly suggested that Trump had fired Comey to influence the FBI inquiry into whether members of the Trump election campaign colluded with the Kremlin.The House of Representatives and Senate intelligence committees are looking into the same allegations but no conclusions have yet been reached."Were these investigations getting too close to home for the president?" Schumer asked a Tuesday evening press conference."This does not seem to be a coincidence," he added.Trump responded on Twitter that Schumer had recently expressed his lack of confidence in the FBI chief.President Trump has repeatedly insisted the Russia allegations are "fake news". He and his Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Washington later on Wednesday.What are Republicans saying?How did Comey handle the email inquiry?Comey has been criticised by Democrats for the handling of his investigation into whether Clinton's use of a private email server when secretary of state compromised national security.The now-former FBI director made two interventions during the 2016 election campaign to make pronouncements about the investigation.He said in July the case should be closed without prosecution, but then declared - 11 days before November's election - that he had reopened the inquiry because of a discovery of a new trove of Clinton-related emails.What was Clinton FBI probe about?He told the Senate last week it had made him "mildly nauseous" to think his intervention could have affected the election, but insisted he would make the same decision again. Clinton lays part of the blame for her shock election defeat last November on Comey.He told the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 3 that Clinton's top aide, Huma Abedin, had forwarded "hundreds and thousands" of emails, "some of which contain classified information", to her husband.But the FBI conceded on Tuesday that Ms Abedin had sent only two email chains containing classified information to her husband, Anthony Weiner, for printing.Watergate 2.0?In June 1972, five men were arrested trying to bug the offices of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) at the Watergate office and hotel complex in Washington. The break-in was traced to President Richard Nixon's supporters.The firing of James Comey is drawing comparisons with the so-called Saturday Night Massacre of 1973, when Nixon fired an independent special prosecutor investigating the break-in and the subsequent cover-up."Not since Watergate has a president dismissed the person leading an investigation bearing on him," the New York Times wrote late on Tuesday.Nixon later admitted he had been aware of the cover-up and had tried to halt the FBI's inquiry. He later became the only US president to resign.
