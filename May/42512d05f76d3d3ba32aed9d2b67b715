Trouble is brewing at the National Police Service Commission after CEO Ojango Omumu was forced out of office almost two years before the end of his five-year contract.On Monday, Omumu was sent on a three-month compulsory leave after a new CEO was appointed in acting capacity.Omumu is the second CEO to be kicked out of office after Elijah Achoch was edged out barely six months after taking office in 2013.Kavuludi ended Achoch&rsquo;s five-year contract on September 26, 2013, over allegations of &ldquo;improper conduct and failure to implement the commission&rsquo;s decisions&rdquo;.Omumu was picked to replace the fired CEO. Achoch challenged his dismissal in court.Omumu&rsquo;s contract was scheduled to end in December 2018.But the NPSC chairman, Johnston Kavuludi, yesterday downplayed claims of a frosty relationship between him and Omumu as reasons behind the CEO&rsquo;s forcible departure.&ldquo;There is nothing wrong with the decision that has been taken. NPSC wants to hire a CEO and Omumu was not one of the candidates who applied for the position. He must go back to the ministry,&rdquo; he said.New boss to be appointed soonOmumu was served with the letter instructing him to vacate office. The Director of Vetting Longinus Mulongo has been appointed CEO in acting capacity.Kavuludi said the NPSC was a step away from hiring a CEO to replace the official, who was seconded by the Interior and National Coordination ministry.Previously, Omumu worked at the office of the Prime Minister.A highly placed source at the NPSC, however, said Omumu and Kavuludi have had a frosty relationship.Last month, Kavuludi is reported to have directed the CEO to keep off the police recruitment.The two are said to have differed over many issues, among them the running of activities at the NPSC.&ldquo;This is the home of impunity; no one wants to follow the law. There is a very clear way of sacking or removing the CEO,&rdquo; said a commissioner at the NPSC headquarters at Skypark House.The final decision on Omumu&rsquo;s job now lies with the head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua. Kinyua is copied in the letter to Omumu.
