Security will remain tight in those areas during and after elections,&rdquo; Rift Valley regional coordinator Wanyama Musiambo said.Security in the areas has improved and officials say residents will be able to participate in the August 8 polls. It is not known if residents are convinced.The areas are Arabal, Kiserian, Mochongoi, Rugus, Mukutani, Chebinyiny, Komolion, Chepkalacha, Makutano, Paa, Orus, Loiywat, Silale, Nando, Tungulbei, Chepkererat, Kipnai, Ng&rsquo;oron and Amay.Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery said the &lsquo;dangerous&rsquo; class would remain in force for 30 days.This will be subject to revocation or extension depending on the state&rsquo;s assessment of the situation in the Kerio Valley. The order was first released on February 28. KDF and other security agencies are carrying out an operation against bandits. The government has so far recruited and deployed 1,000 National Police Reservists to improve security in Kerio Valley. Musiambo said the NPRs deployed in Baringo, Turkana, West Pokot and Elgeyo Marakwet have helped to reduce attacks in the last three months.The reservists will be trained by the government at the Manyani KWS College starting September. Their names will be in the payroll, although salaries have not been determined.Musiambo said the government recognises the role played by the reservists in improving security.&ldquo;The government has taken steps to restructure how the reservists will work under the National Police Service,&rdquo; he said. A director will be appointed to be in charge of the reservists and they will be based at Vigilance House, Nairobi.
