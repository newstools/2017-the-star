Tension is high in parts of Laikipia county after armed herders terrorised residents in what is considered poppulation displacement ahead of the August 8 election.On Wednesday, 10 herders believed to be from the neighbouring Baringo county disrupted a security meeting convened at Matuiku village by the chief. They shot in the air several times.There has been a large influx of Pokot cattle into West and north Laikipia in the last 10 days as well as large numbers of Samburu returning to north Laikipia. It has rained more in the counties to the north and west than it has in Laikipia so residents suspect that it is a plan to remove registered voters before the August 8 election, or a move to make the pastoralist invasion of Laikipia a permanent land grab. Githiga ward MCA Peter Thomi yesterday said, &ldquo;The herders disappeared into the valleys at the Laikipia Nature Conservancy before coming back at night to loot household items and livestock. Residents are now living in fear, a situation that is forcing them to spend nights in the cold.&rdquo;County commissioner Onesmus Musyoki said security officers have managed to drive out most herders from neighbouring regions who had invaded private ranches and farms.On Tuesday, hundreds of residents of Ngobit area in Laikipia East subcounty protested against the increasing cases of cattle rustling.They blocked the Nyeri- Nyahururu road. Musyoki said security officers have recovered over 15 guns from herders in a two-month operation.He said officers have had to employ new strategies, adding the invasions were politically instigated.Rift Valley regional commissioner Wanyama Musiambo has issued a security alert terming Rumuruti, Olmoran, Kirimon, Marmanet, Mukogodo East, Segera and Matuiku areas as &ldquo;dangerous and disturbed&rdquo;.
