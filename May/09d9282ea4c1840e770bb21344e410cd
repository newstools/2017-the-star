Aden Duale has torn into "desperate" Farah Maalim for accusing IEBC of being unfair in the run up to August polls.The Garissa Town MP and National Assembly Majority leader said his rival has panicked and is "loitering in the streets of Nairobi" blaming the electoral body."IEBC will not help failed, rural political rejects," he wrote on Twitter adding the former National Assembly Deputy Speaker did not defend his Lagdera seat in 2013.Maalim was Lagdera MP from 1993 to 1998 and made a come-back in 2008."You ran as a senator but lost by over 25,000 votes to the respected Yusuf Haji," the incumbent said.Duale noted it is the people, not the IEBC, who vote. He said he will beat Maalim who has been accusing the electoral body of favouring him in the race for Garissa Town MP."In August, we shall dig your political grave by sending you back to Lagdera," he wrote on Saturday.Duale is a member of Jubilee Party and Maalim of Opposition chief Raila Odinga's party.Maalim once said the Majority leader belongs in jail for incitement.He said that two days after a clip in which Duale is heard inciting local youths against members of the Kamba community surfaced on social media, two members of the community were beaten up and injured in Garissa"Duale is a criminal who should not be walking free. If the Government is serious about taming violence, President Uhuru should instruct the Inspector General of Police to arrest Duale today and he be charged in court. He should be committed to jail and its immoral for him to roam around after inciting people to violence," Maalim said.More on this: [VIDEO] Duale belongs in jail, Farah Maalim says after alleged incitement remarksAlso see:[AUDIO] Duale dismisses audio of incitement against Kamba voters as concocted propagandaMaalim said he is ready for the election as the electorate require good leadership skills, not "a leader who keeps politicking without a vision"."Duale has no chance of winning the election because he has never had a chance.
