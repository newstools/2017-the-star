A group of evictees from Maasai Mau Forest in Narok South will support NASA this year as the Jubilee administration has not resettled them after being evicted in 2015, they say.Spokesman Bernard Sang said the government has been giving them false promises.&ldquo;We are backing Raila Odinga and NASA because the state has been taking us in circles for a long time,&rdquo; he told journalists in Arorwet on Sunday. Sang defended Raila against claims that he was responsible for the 2009 Mau evictions in the South West Mau when he was Prime Minister.&ldquo;If some of our leaders claimed that Raila evicted people, what about in the 2005 and 2015 evictions? The leaders need to be honest and tell Kenyans the truth about the Mau issue,&rdquo; he said.Sang said when Raila was in power, he tried to establish clear boundaries between farms and the forest.He refuted claims by Deputy President William Ruto that the caveat imposed on title deeds in land surrounding the forest has been lifted. The DP is desperate and wants to use the issue to get the Kipsigis votes, Sang said.The eviction of the 5,000 families has cropped up every election year in the last 10 years and it is clear it would be an issue in this election, he said.&ldquo;Politicians have kept assuring us in every election that we will be resettled and fully compensated, but the evictions keep recurring after an election,&rdquo; Sang said.Rebecca Mosonik said they have suffered since they were evicted and Jubilee leaders have avoided the area even though they voted for the party in 2013.&ldquo;We have been hearing President Uhuru Kenyatta and the DP visiting neighbouring counties like Bomet and there is no single time they came to visit us. This government has treated us like animals and we are saying enough is enough. We are now supporting NASA,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;The only appreciation they gave us after electing them is to evict us, burn our houses and destroy our schools and churches. They are happy when they see us live in makeshift homes by the road.&rdquo; The residents invited NASA presidential candidate Raila and the Pentagon team to visit them and address their plight.
