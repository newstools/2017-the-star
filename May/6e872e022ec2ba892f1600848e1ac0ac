The Kakamega Assembly Public Accounts and Investment Committee has recommended the audit of Sh150 million disbursed to 12 wards by the county government in 2014-15. A report by the committee tabled in the assembly on Wednesday by chairman Samuel Mwanzi says the accountability of the money remains questionable. It says the money was not declared as it had been expensed on disbursement. “A special audit of accounts in which the money was deposited is necessary to ascertain the propriety of the funds and the amount of interest earned and officers concerned,” the report says. The committee recommends further investigation and prosecution of officers who authorised single sourcing of consultancy services amounting to Sh38.9 million by the county government. The report says the government single sourced Infotrack Research and Consultancy to carry out a study on customer satisfaction at Sh4.2 million. The report says the government paid Sh26.5 million to P Kundu Architects for planning, design, preparation of tender documents and supervision of Phase Two modern market construction in Kakamega town. Enos Lanogwa was paid Sh729, 000 to carry out an in-depth survey of Kakamega Forest. The report says Sh2.4 billion has not been reconciled. Some Sh1.9 billion was paid by the county government manually. It bypassed the Integrated Financial Management Information System during the year under review. The committee found that the county bought assets worth Sh2.5 billion since 2013 but it has not entered them in the register of assets. The committee also recommended that the single sourcing of cleaning services worth Sh63,870,177 be withdrawn within a month of the adoption of its report. This pending a forensic audit by the EACC to ascertain the procurement procedures.
