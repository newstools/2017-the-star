Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya has said he will run for president after ODM leader Raila Odinga finishes his term.Oparanya said Raila has committed to be a one-term transitional president and he will thereafter try his luck in 2022.The governor was addressing a public rally at Lusheya market in Mumias East constituency on Tuesday.&ldquo;I have told Raila that he must make sure he does not miss the target this time because he has one bullet. If he misses again, I will try my luck for the top seat because I have also supported him,&rdquo; he said. Oparanya is one of the two deputies of Raila in ODM.Oparanya&rsquo;s pronouncement could ignite turf wars with ANC leader and NASA founder Musalia Mudavadi, and Ford Kenya&rsquo;s Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula.Both are angling to succeed Raila in 2022 if NASA wins.Lugari MP Ayub Savula on Friday said Mudavadi will &ldquo;automatically&rdquo; succeed Raila.Oparanya said calls for ODM to leave key county seats in Western for ANC and Ford Kenya after Mudavadi and Wetang&rsquo;ula sacrificed their presidential ambitions for Raila are misplaced. He will only sell the ODM agenda during his campaigns since there is no agreement on joint nominations under NASA.&ldquo;NASA is just at the top there and down here there is nothing like that because I must ensure ODM has more seats so that the region can benefit from Raila&rsquo;s government.However, NASA principals Raila, Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper), Musalia Mudavadi (ANC) have signed a power-sharing agreement and deposited with the Registrar of Political Parties.Oparanya said Luhyas supporting Jubilee are traitors of the community since the government has ignored the region.&ldquo;The President came here in December and promised that the Ibokolo-Shiada and Lurambi-Nambacha-Bungoma roads will be tarmacked but nothing has happened to date,&rdquo; he said. Oparanya said the government was insincere in its efforts to revive the cash strapped Mumias Sugar Company. He said Jubilee turned down his offer to have the 20 per cent shareholding by the government transferred to the county government.The governor has in the past said the national government collects cess from sugar millers in Kakamega but does not remit it to the county to fix roads. He said sugar factories have refused to remit the cess levy for roads maintenance in the sugar belt. &ldquo;To make matters worse, the national government keeps collecting the Sugar Development Levy meant for purchase of road construction equipment,&rdquo; the governor said.
