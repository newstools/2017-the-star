Some Wiper leaders from Ukambani counties have criticised Senator Muthama&rsquo;s move to ditch Wiper on allegations the party is undemocratic.Speaking to the Star yesterday, MPs Robert Mbui (Kathaini), Patrick Makau (Mavoko) and Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo Junior said Muthama&rsquo;s move is insincere.Mbui said it was outrageous for Senator Muthama to call Kalonzo a dictator yet he (Muthama) is the one who has been bullying other leaders.&ldquo;A good example was in 2013 when he cost the party several parliamentary seats in the county because of his dictatorial style of leadership,&rdquo; Mbui said.He said the senator&rsquo;s bitterness stems from the fact that his plans of installing a governor he will be able to control have failed.&ldquo;What the senator wanted was to have control of Machakos for his own selfish interests. He wanted to have a stooge for governor so that he is able to get access to the county resources. Now that this has failed, he has turned his guns on Kalonzo,&rdquo; he said.Mbui said the senator&rsquo;s decision to drop his candidature at the last minute is aimed at ensuring Wiper lacks a candidate for the same position.&ldquo;When he realised that his preferred candidate for the position of governor, Bernard Kiala, won&rsquo;t make it, he started scheming on how to sink the party by ensuring it lacks a governor candidate and a senator candidate,&rdquo; Mbui said.His sentiments were echoed by Mavoko MP Patrick Makua, who said Muthama&rsquo;s move to ditch Wiper is a case of a tyranny of dictatorship in the party, but his plans will crumble.Makau said with Muthama outside the party, the democratic space is expected to grow.In a text to the Star, Senator Kilonzo Junior denied there will be a vacuum in the party with Muthama out.Mutula said the only issue is that the senator&rsquo;s absence will have an impact on the overall party outlook, but public perception will not favour division.Another MP, who was not elected on the Wiper ticket, Francis Mwangangi , said Senator Muthama is running away from his political misgivings.&ldquo;The community expected Senator Muthama to deliver the presidential ticket, but because he has failed that is why he wants to hide behind retiring from politics,&rdquo; Mwangangi said.
