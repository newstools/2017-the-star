The US will consider its interests first as it reviews its climate change policy, the secretary of state says.Rex Tillerson told a meeting of the eight Arctic nations in Alaska that the US would not rush to make a decision and would consider their views.President Donald Trump has expressed doubts over the human role in climate change and has said he may pull the US out of the Paris Accord to fight it.Meanwhile, other Arctic countries have called for a cut on greenhouse gases.Climate change was the biggest issue at the biennial meeting of the Arctic Council in Fairbanks, which was overshadowed by the uncertainties over Trump's policy.Tillerson, the former chief executive of Exxon Mobil, told the meeting that the administration was reviewing how it would approach climate change."We are appreciative that each of you has an important point of view, and you should know that we are taking the time to understand your concerns," he said."We're not going to rush to make a decision. We're going to work to make the right decision for the United States."Trump is to decide whether the US will leave or reduce its commitments to the Paris agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which was negotiated by around 200 nations and signed in 2015.An announcement is expected after a trip to Europe later this month.The joint agreement by the Arctic Council mentioned the Paris accord only in a passing reference, which noted the deal's entry into force and implementation.But the text did not recommit its members to meet the pledges made.
