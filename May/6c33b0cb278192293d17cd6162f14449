Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi and his Nandi Hills counterpart Alfred Keter have demanded a speedy probe into the murder of Eldoret MCA aspirant James Ratemo's three children.The children were found murdered on Friday and their bodies dumped in River Nzoia after they went missing for over five days."We demand a speedy probe into the incident that has caused panic among all parents in Kenya," Keter said during a visit to the aspirant's home on Saturday."People are now living in fear and locking their children in houses out of fear following what has happened."The legislators asked the police to conduct investigations towards revealing the perpetrators of the act and their motive in the killings."We want to know who was involved and why they committed the act," the Nandi Hills MP said.For his part, Sudi said: "We have to know the truth so that the parents of these children can bury them knowing what happened."The legislators asked Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery ensure the incident is probed to the last detail."We will also raise the matter in parliament because it touches on the lives of all Kenyans," Keter said.The MPs said the leaders in the region will help the family meet the funeral and burial expenses of the children.Ratemo, the children's father, ruled out politics as the motive of the killing saying he has not differed with any of his opponents.He termed the killings as evil and the work of the devil"I wonder why someone would do this to my children. It&rsquo;s too much for me to bear and I just leave everything to God," he said."I loved them so much and I don't understand why they had to be killed. I hope police will help us to unravel what happened."Clifford (seven), Glen (three) and Taya (five) were reported missing last Saturday after they did not return home from Eldovil SDA Church.Taya was a class one pupil of Shalom Academy while Clifton attended Highlands Academy.Their father is vying for the Kapsoya ward representative seat on a Kanu ticket.The family had put up posters of the children amid a search for them before their bodies were found on Thursday night.Their uncle Enock Onsanze was arrested on Friday as he was the one last seen with them. He was charged with abduction. [VIDEO] Three children of Eldoret MCA aspirant found murdered
