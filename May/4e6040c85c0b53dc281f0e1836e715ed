Political families are struggling to cling on to power five decades since Independence.The political landscape has been reconfigured to accommodate 4,500 independent candidates, who are threatening the strong political party. Traditionally, winning nominations in the party strongholds meant a direct ticket to Parliament. But all that may change in the August election. Members and close allies of the Kenyatta, Odinga, Moi and Kibaki families fared badly in the party primaries.President Uhuru Kenyatta, opposition chief Raila Odinga, Baringo Senator Gideon Moi and Rongai MP Raymond Moi were given direct tickets in the parties to avoid nominations.Uhuru and Raila were directly nominated as party leaders of Jubilee and ODM.As party leaders, Uhuru and Raila are also automatically the presidential flagbearers.Raila, however, had to negotiate with Musalia Mudavadi (ANC), Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper) and Moses Wetang'ula (Ford Kenya) to be the National Super Alliance presidential candidate.Uhuru and Raila will face off on August 8 in a do-or-die election.If Uhuru wins, he will be in office for his second and last term. If Raila wins, he will form a transitional government to endorse his running mate Kalonzo Musyoka for the country&rsquo;s top seat at the end of his first term.Uhuru's cousin Annah Nyokabi was floored in the race for the Jubilee Kiambu woman rep ticket by Kameme FM presenter Gathoni Muchomba.The battle to control the Rift Valley vote bloc has intensified between the DP and Gideon because Kanu will field Raymond in Rongai and Kibet Komen in Kuresoi.Nominated MP Oburu Oginga lost in the Bondo ODM primaries to incumbent Gideon Ochanda.Raila&rsquo;s relatives Oburu Oginga (Bondo MP), Ruth Odinga (Kisumu governor) and first cousin Jakoyo Midiwo all lost in the primaries.
