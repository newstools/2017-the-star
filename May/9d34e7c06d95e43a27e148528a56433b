The results of Wiper primaries held yesterday are not genuine, Maendeleo Chap Chap leader Alfred Mutua has said.Mutua said the party blatantly misled and lied to the public about the results of governor primaries in several polling stations in Machakos county.&ldquo;The total votes cast for the county woman rep in the same area were 89,541. How then could the total of one for the gubernatorial aspirants have an additional 200,000 voters? These additional numbers are cooked figures and ghost voters. The Wiper figures are fake, fake and fake and pure propaganda,&rdquo; Mutua said.Wavinya Ndeti beat her opponent, Bernard Kiala with 299,312 votes against 4,663.Kiala had obtained a court order barring Wiper from conducting the primaries.He argued Wiper had an agreement with Wavinya&rsquo;s Chama Cha Uzalendo to give her a direct ticket.However, Wiper leaders said they had not been served with the orders and therefore went on with the polls.&ldquo;There was hardly any massive voting going on yesterday. No queues were seen. It was a Sunday and many polling stations opened in the afternoon. This is in addition to the fact that it was widely known the court had halted the primaries, which meant that fewer people turned up,&rdquo; Mutua said.The governor also said Wiper was getting desperate and carried on with the primaries despite the court order.&ldquo;Wiper Party has top lawyers in its leadership who are officers of the court and who understand what a court order is, and who know that it is illegal to cook figures. Shame on you Kalonzo Musyoka and Wiper Party. Shame on you,&rdquo; Mutua said. &ldquo;The people of Machakos county are not stupid and Maendeleo Chap Chap has the full support of voters who are tired of lies, games and lack of a stand.&rdquo;
