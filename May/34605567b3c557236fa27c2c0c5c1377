Wiper governor nominee Wavinya Ndeti has extended an olive branch to her competitor Bernard Kiala in the just concluded party primaries. Wavinya won the ticket for the Machakos governor seat with 299,312 votes against Kiala's 4,663. Kiala had obtained a court order barring Wiper from conducting the primaries since Wiper already had an agreement with Wavinya's CCU to give her a direct ticket. "I felt insecure going into a nomination when this kind of agreement signed by Wiper leader [Kalonzo Musyoka] is in force. I felt like I was walking into a trap," he told journalists on Sunday.

"Kiala is like a brother and I love him. Machakos county is bigger than any of us and now that we are in the same party, he should come join me so that we work together," she said on Monday. She said out of respect to Wiper party, she subjected herself to the primaries despite the agreement that guaranteed her a direct ticket. "[Kalonzo] found it very difficult to ask me to go into nominations with Kiala when there was an already signed agreement. "But since I was confident and knew I had done my groundwork very well, I overlooked it and decided we battle it out in public," she said. Wavinya thanked residents for turning up in large numbers to vote and assured them of real development should she win in the August 8 elections. She will be facing off with incumbent Governor Alfred Mutua who will be vying on a Maendeleo Chap Chap ticket.
