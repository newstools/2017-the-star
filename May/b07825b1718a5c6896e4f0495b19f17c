Magarini MP Harrison Kombe claimed in April that reflexology can cure serious ailments including early stage HIV and kidney failure, and "reactivate men's sexual organs".The baraza he addressed in Kilifi found his theory on Asian massage therapy funny, and not without reason. The cure for HIV/Aids has not been found but Reuters reported last November that scientists were taking the battle to prevent HIV to the next level with large-scale trials.Kombe's claim was funny to a baraza he addressed in Kilifi, a county where 31,630 people out of an estimated population of 1,466,856,are living with HIV/Aids.Reflexology is the practice of applying pressure to specific points on the feet, hands and ears that correspond to the glands, organs and other body systems.To date, there has been no scientific evidence that it can cure HIV. The UK&rsquo;s Association of Reflexologists warns members not to make claims that they can cure, diagnose or prescribe treatment for any medical conditions.However, this does not mean there is no merit in the treatment. There is some evidence that reflexology can relieve pain and stress, especially when combined with traditional medicines.In a study in Nonthaburi Thailand, researchers conducted a random clinical trial to test the impact of foot reflexology or mimic foot reflexology in 28 hospitalised patients diagnosed with Aids, to determine their perceptions of pain and fatigue.The sample consisted of 67.9 per cent males aged 22-47. Research nurses were trained in the procedures of true foot reflexology and mimic foot reflexology with each course of treatment lasting 30 minutes (15 minutes per leg).The results found that true foot reflexology may offer a low cost effective nursing intervention to reduce symptoms of fatigue and pain for hospitalised Aids patients. The only vital sign difference was a lower systolic blood pressure, but this was not clinically meaningful.Another study on cancer patients found those who received the treatment in addition to their regular medication showed some signs of improvement. It found patients experiencedless pain, anxiety, vomiting and fatigue.Kombe's claim is therefore false; reflexology can relieve some pain and stress in patients with serious illnesses but cannot cure their illnesses.FactboxMore on this: Thousands of HIV negative Kenyans to be put on ARVs to prevent infectionAlso read: Anti-HIV pill saved my marriage: New drug cuts infection risk by 96%
