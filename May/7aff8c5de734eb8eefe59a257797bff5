A curfew imposed in Mandera county in October last year has been extended until the end of the Holy month of Ramadhan. This comes after more than eight police officers were killed in separate bomb attacks in Garissa and Mandera counties between Wednesday and Thursday. Five officers in Governor Ali Robaâ€™s convoy were killed when their
Land Cruiser ran over an improvised explosive device between Arabia and
Lafey in Mandera. In
Garissa, three AP officers were killed in the morning and five others
injured when their vehicle ran over an IED on the Kulan-Liboi road,
seven kilometres from Kulan, Garissa county. Al Shabaab militants claimed responsibility for the attacks.

Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery has also urged members of the public to cooperate fully with the police and ensure the Ramadhan period remains peaceful. During the burial of some of the slain officers, Wajir Governor Ahmed Abdullahi warned that Kenya risks losing parts of the Northern region to the terror group. "If communication equipment can be destroyed by terror groups and no one
minds months later, it is my fear that we will lose part of the country
to the terror group," he said. Roba told The Star that the national government should step in urgently and address insecurity in the North Eastern region. "Over a year ago, masts were brought down by these terror groups yet nothing much has been done to repair them," he said. "The attack was not a coincidence. It was well-calculated and targeted Mandera leaders."
