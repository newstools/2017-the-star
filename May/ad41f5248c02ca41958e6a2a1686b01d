More than 500 women who turned up for KDF recruitment in Lamu county were turned away yesterday as men got the coveted chance to join the armed forces.The women flocked to the Kibaki Grounds in Lamu Island, hoping to pass the tests for enlistment.It was not to be.They went away disappointed after it was announced that this year&rsquo;s recruitment was for men only.Many women were frustrated and angry, saying this wasn&rsquo;t the first time they were rejected only because of gender.Joyce Mnyazi said it was unfair that female applicants were not considered, despite their qualification.&ldquo;They gave the same excuse last year. Does it mean the army has enough females or is it that people feel the army is only better off with men?&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;This is my third and last year of trying to join the KDF without success.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m 28 and I know it won&rsquo;t be possible for me to try out in the next exercise. It&rsquo;s so unfortunate and unfair.&rdquo;However, senior recruitment officer Kyalo Munyao defended the decision and said there was nothing sinister about it.The exercise is not insensitive to gender, he said.&ldquo;We are complying with regulations on filling available slots,&rdquo; Kyalo said.&ldquo;For Lamu slots, there were no vacancies for women in the army this year, hence, the decision to send back all female hopefuls.&rdquo;This is the second time Lamu women faced rejection. The same thing happened last year.Across Africa, women&rsquo;s participation in the armed forces remains low.In 2013, Kenya had about 1,000 women in its defence forces. This was out of an active force of at least 24,000 members.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s unfortunate that we aren&rsquo;t recruiting females this year. There are no vacancies,&rdquo; Kyalo said.&ldquo;We, however, look forward to recruiting them in future. There is no need to lose hope or speculate.&rdquo;Meanwhile, some men failed to pass the tests or meet the minimum grade for the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education.This has been pegged at D plain, but some had D-minus and E grades, meaning instant disqualification. Many men were dropped at the initial stages.The recruitment kicked off late, past 10am. The delay was caused by a heavy downpour that started in the early morning.
