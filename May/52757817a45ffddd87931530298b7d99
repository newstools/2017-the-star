NASA flag bearer Raila Odinga has accused Anne Waiguru of refusing to respond to questions that will enable him defend himself in a defamation suit.The former Devolution CS sued Raila on September 29, 2015, saying he had &ldquo;recklessly tarnished&rdquo; her name in an address to the press at his office on July 17, 2015.At the press conference, Raila released a dossier on Waiguru and said President Uhuru Kenyatta kept her name off the corruption 'list of shame'.In a response filed at the High court in Milimani, Raila says Waiguru has refused to respond to matters to do with her lifestyle.The interrogatories , he said, will enable him adequately defend himself in the suit which he wants dismissed.Interrogatories are written questions sent to a party from his or her adversary to clarify facts and issues for trial.Waiguru has refused to answer questions on the basic salary she earned from 2006 to November 2015.Raila also wants the Kirinyaga governor aspirant to categorically state the amount of allowances she earned monthly.He has also asked her to give a list of properties she owns, including houses and cars, and tell what type they are and how much they are worth.The NASA principal also wants to know whether Waiguru traded in the Nairobi Stock Exchange while she was a Cabinet Secretary.She has also been asked for a list of her dependents and the amount of money she spent on each of them.Raila said the plaint should be struck out as Waiguru&rsquo;s failure to reveal the crucial information will deny him a fair trial."I will be greatly prejudiced if these interrogatory questions are not answered as I will not be in a position to sufficiently prepare for trial," Raila says.He says Waiguru has a duty to answer the questions as ordered by the court, failure to which she ought to be deemed to have willfully disobeyed a court order.But the former CS has accused Raila of embarking on a fishing expedition.Waiguru said the ODM leader is being unreasonable, irrelevant and is employing tactics to stall the suit as the 15 questions do not relate to issues raised in the defamation suit.She noted some concern her children and matters that are not among those in court."The information sought is malicious and threatens to unnecessarily violate the privacy of minors who are not party in this suit."The former CS wants Raila found liable as his assertions that she was aware of theft at the NYS meant she used her position to engage in corruption."He portrayed me as a woman of low moral standing, who is involved in unethical and professional misconduct," she said.Last year, Raila told a court that Uhuru should testify as his key witness against Waiguru.But the President is unlikely to show up as he enjoys immunity against civil proceedings as the head of state.Read: Raila wants Uhuru as witness in court over Anne Waiguru
