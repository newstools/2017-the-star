Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto should stop attacking Deputy President William Ruto for lifting the caveat on title deeds of land surrounding the Mau Forest, a Kipsigis leader n Narok county has said.Narok Kipsigis Professionals chairman Nahashon Langat said the governor is using the Mau as a political tool against the DP, yet Ruto is trying to give lasting solutions to the thorny 15-year issue.He told journalists in Narok town at the weekend that the CCM leader should stick to Bomet politics.&ldquo;We were born and brought up in the Mau region and we know the challenges affecting us, not an outsider like Bomet governor,&rdquo; Langat said.Last weekend, Ruto accused the governor of misleading the Kipsigis on the Mau issue and opposing state projects to make JP fail and give NASA votes.Rutto had accused the DP of capitalising on the Mau evictions and resettlement to secure the Kipsigis vote.He asked the DP to state whether the order has been gazetted and when it was done.
