The Very Rev John Gatu, the former moderator of the Presbyterian Church of East Africa, is dead. He had just celebrated his 93rd birthday in March. Family friends and the PCEA confirmed the veteran cleric died on Thursday at the Karen Hospital, where he was receiving treatment. He was rushed to hospital on Tuesday after a massive heart attack. He collapsed at his Muteero home, Karen. Gatu was PCEA moderator of the ninth and 10th General Assembly in 1979 –1985. He was the first Africa Secretary General of PCEA, serving in 1963 – 1979, and was among the founders and pioneer of the World Council of Churches. He was critical of excesses of previous governments, especially President Daniel Moi’s. In December last year, he launched his autobiography, Fanning the Flame, in which he revealed Mau Mau oath ceremonies in the Mount Kenya region, in the process implicating Kenya’s First President Jomo Kenyatta. President Uhuru Kenyatta mourned Gatu, describing him as a committed religious leader who led a life of simplicity and service aided by his strong character and independent mind.
