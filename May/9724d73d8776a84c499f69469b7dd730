The bus that caused the deaths of 20 people on Saturday morning on Nakuru-Gilgil highway had been operating illegally for about a month.National Transport and Safety Authority Director General Francis Meja said the bus was suspended by the Super Highway Sacco on April 18, 2017 for flouting traffic rules.Read: 20 dead, several injured in Nakuru-Nairobi accidentAlso read: 60 injured in Samburu road accident while travelling to political rallyThe law stipulates that all public service vehicles must be members of a registered sacco before being allowed to operate.&ldquo;The vehicle&rsquo;s inspection license expired around February and it had no valid road service license. So clearly, this vehicle ought not to have been on the road. It is a clear case of impunity,&rdquo; Meja said during a live TV interview on Saturday.A letter from the sacco however indicated that the bus was suspended from the Sacco on July 28 last year for failing to remit management fee for route operations. Meja however said they are yet to ascertain whether the bus had been operating prior to the accident Saturday&rsquo;s trip was its maiden journey since the suspension.&ldquo;Those are the questions we have to ask our teams on the ground. We don&rsquo;t know whether this was the first time it was operating. We are still to establish,&rdquo; he said.Meja confirmed that one of the directors of the bus had been arrested while one was still at large.The driver of the ill-fated bus was also arrested late Saturday at a hideout in within Nakuru town.Read: Driver of ill-fated bus that killed 20 in Nakuru arrestedRead: Uhuru orders probe after Nakuru accident claims 20 livesMeja said that NTSA is digitizing its operations to seal gaps where an offending crew or vehicle enlists with a different sacco and continues with operations after being suspended for traffic offenses.&ldquo;Today it&rsquo;s not possible to move from one sacco to the other sacco without being released from your original sacco,&rdquo; Meja said.Meja regretted that despite the major strides that had been made over the years to reduce road carnage, recklessness was still leading to loss of lives on the roads.Read: Road fatalities fall by 6.7% &ndash; NTSA
