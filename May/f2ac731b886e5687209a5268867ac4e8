West Pokot is among the counties with the highest number of teenage pregnancies, which has greatly hampered girls&rsquo; education.The rate of teenage pregnancy stands at 29 per cent, higher than the national average of 18.This implies that in every 10 girls in West Pokot, three have had or are pregnant with their first child.In the 2014 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey report, West Pokot was among the five counties heavily burdened with teenage pregnancy. Others are Narok at 40 per cent, Homa Bay 33.3 per cent, Tana River 28 per cent and Samburu 25 per cent.North Rift regional population coordinator Moses Ouma said the state and counties should address issues in the community that contribute to the high rate.&ldquo;Pokot community culture has forced teenagers to engage in sex early and many schools in this region do not focus on comprehensive sexual education in schools. Teachers think it is a taboo,&rdquo; he said on Sunday during a one-day workshop in Kapenguria.According to KDHS, 37.3 per cent of girls and 40.6 per cent of boys aged 15-19 years have already experienced sexual intercourse.&ldquo;Only 49.3 per cent of unmarried sexually active girls and 64.2 per cent boys aged 20-24 years used modern contraception (male condom). This is a clear indicator of how sexually active these young people are and the earlier methods are provided to curb the same, the better,&rdquo; the report says.
