Lamu fishermen and sailors have been warned against venturing into the deep seas during the rainy season. Lamu director of meteorological services David Mwaruma said the ocean is experiencing high tides, especially between 3am and 4 am, which is the fishermen's favorite time.Speaking at his Lamu office on Thursday, Mwaruma said the changes at sea have caused strong winds, which are dangerous to fishermen and sailors. He cautioned locals living in old buildings in Mokowe, Witu and Pate, among others that they might collapse due to the heavy rains.&ldquo;We are glad for the rains, more so after the drought spell. The rains have however come before the time we expected and we must warn that the tides will be at their worst in the next seven days ... The extremely high tides are caused by the increased rainfall,&rdquo; Mwaruma said.
