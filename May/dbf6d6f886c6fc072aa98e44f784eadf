Kwale Jubilee leaders on Tuesday promised to deliver 70 per cent of the county’s votes to President Uhuru Kenyatta. Governor Salim Mvurya, woman representative Zainab Chidzuga, Gonzi Rai and MP Khatib Mwashetani said they are committed to ensuring Kwale contributes significantly to Uhuru’s victory in the August election. In 2013, Uhuru got 20 per cent of votes cast at 17,633 against then-Cord candidate Raila Odinga’s 101,407. The leaders spoke at the Culture Centre in Kwale town, where they issued nomination certificates to winners. Mvurya expressed confidence that he will retain his seat and added that JP will win more MP and MCA seats than NASA. He urged nominees to campaign together to increase their chances of victory. Chidzuga thanked the Jubilee administration for working with residents and implementing development projects.
