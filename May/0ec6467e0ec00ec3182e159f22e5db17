Apart from school fees, they have also been provided with learning materials and school uniforms,&rdquo; he said.Nawiri said the three organisations give the needy children livestock such as goats and sheep, as well poultry, to improve their livelihoods.&ldquo;We are determined to improve on the economic lives of the orphaned and vulnerable children, the majority of whom had initially been forced to drop out of school and engage in child labour in rice fields,&rdquo; Nawiri said.He cautioned the children&rsquo;s guardians against selling the items.&ldquo;These items are meant to protect the OVCs from jiggers, so do not be tempted to sell them for financial gain,&rdquo; Nawiri said.
