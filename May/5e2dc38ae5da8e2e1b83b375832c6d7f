The Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company yesterday was ordered to restore water supply to all public primary schools that it disconnected over huge outstanding bills.NCWSC chairman Raphael Nzomo said the 205 primary schools owe the company more than Sh41 million. The company had already disconnected 16 schools.They include Roysambu, Kayole, Kangemi, Komarok, Umoja II, Lan&rsquo;gata Road and Kilimani primary schools.&ldquo;We are a utility company and we do not make profits. So if we are not paid for the service, we may not be able to run,&rdquo; Nzomo said.He said some bills have accumulated for more than a year.Governor Evans Kidero ordered the company to restore supply, adding the county is negotiating with the national government about how to settle the debt.According to the Constitution, it is the role of the national government to foot both water and electricity bills of all public schools.The government allocates Sh60 per child for water, electricity and conservancy per year, an amount the governor and the school headquarters said is too little to meet bills.&ldquo;On average, we pay between Sh300,000 and Sh1 million per month and in my school, I have 1000 pupils. That means I get Sh60,000 per year. You can see how little this is,&rdquo; Milimani Primary School head teacher Charles Kado said. He said some schools were disconnected more than five months ago.Some schools, he said, have been buying water from vendors whose quality could not be guaranteed.&ldquo;We urge the national government to consider reviewing the capitation grant it offers to children because the current one is unfair and turns us into beggars,&rdquo; Kado, who is also the Nairobi branch Kenya Primary Schools Head Teachers Association secretary, said.He addressed the press at City Hall in Nairobi.
