Political and commercial risks will be a key issue shaping investment decisions by global firms into Africa, a meeting bringing together top government and private sector officials on the continent heard in Nairobi yesterday.African Trade Insurance Agency, the pan-African investment and commercial risk insurance provider, said that African governments stand to lose foreign direct investments and access to affordable financing if this is not addressed.Infrastructure financing gap for Africa, the round-table forum heard, is estimated at $900 billion (Sh92.88 trillion).The forum discussed how best to tackle investment and credit risk hurdles arising from geopolitical uncertainties, with the aim of making African risks bankable.&ldquo;Public-private partnerships are a response to the structural needs of investors in our countries. This is necessary to break the persistent perception of the continent being high risk and Africa as a problem region,&rdquo; visiting Benin president Patrice Talon said.The meeting emphasised the need to adequately address the requirements for a favourable investment environment to avert loss of billions of dollars by the private sector as a result of lost investment opportunities.&ldquo;In this context, credit and investment insurance is the perfect defence to counter this challenge and to help propel the continent toward self-sustainability for the betterment of the African people,&rdquo; Talon said.ATI said it insured close to $4 billion (about Sh412.56 billion) worth of trade and investments in 2016. The insurer, 12 per cent controlled by Kenya, said it is increasingly supporting some of the continent&rsquo;s key capital-intensive developments. ATI cited Ethiopian Airline&rsquo;s fleet expansion and a $660 million (Sh68.11 billion) investment in the Lake Turkana Wind Farm, Africa&rsquo;s largest wind farm on completion as some of the projects it has guaranteed.&ldquo;Africa is in a period of realignment in this new global order but I don&rsquo;t think anyone should bet against its resilience. We are still home to some of the fastest growing economies in the world,&rdquo; ATI agency chief executive George Otieno said.ATI said it will continue to facilitate support for investment on the continent amid uncertainty, adding that this will be a valuable tool in enabling lenders to take sub-investment grade risk in Africa.This, the firm said, would allow both governments and corporate to access more affordable financing.&ldquo;ATI offers the ideal solution precisely because the company has strong relationships with governments and because its risk assessments and mitigation solutions are seen as credible by global financiers and investors,&rdquo; Otieno said.
