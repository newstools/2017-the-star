It was late one early evening that I drove onto the tar road section in the park. It had been a long day, and to be honest I was not really looking very hard to see animals. Then in the distance I saw the shapes of giraffes. After approaching a bit closer, it appeared that there were at least 20 in this herd. Then after stopping my vehicle and switching off the engine, I sat and watched the giraffes all interacting with each other around a pool of water, some drinking, some calves playing, others mock-fighting, others just standing watch. What made the scene really worthwhile was the beautiful sunset and the profiles of the giraffes darkened against the fading light. What an amazing scene! In just a few minutes of watching giraffes in nature, I had taken in some &ldquo;soul tonic&rdquo; and was already feeling much better.Giraffes are found in quite a few locations in Kenya, mostly in national parks and reserves. There are three species: Rothchilds, Reticulated, and Masai. The masai giraffe are found in the Nairobi Park. The Swahili name for a giraffe is &ldquo;twiga&rdquo;. Is it coincidence, then, that they eat so many twigs? Giraffe have long, tough purplish-coloured tongues that they use very effectively to eat on thorn trees such as the acacia species. Note that in their very long neck, there are only seven vertebrae, as in humans. They are strange-looking creatures. I have clear childhood memories of singing silly happy songs with my parents, like &ldquo;Gerry giraffe, he makes us all laugh&hellip;.&rdquo;.To be able to enjoy the creation of God always results in finding peace and rest. Bring your family and come explore the wonders of the Nairobi National Park.
