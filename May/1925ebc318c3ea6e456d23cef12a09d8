A fierce war of words broke out between Kenyans and Tanzanians on Twitter on Wednesday morning.It all started when former Big Brother Africa (BBA) star Idris Sultan sent out a tweet saying Kenyans should move to Tanzania because of the many problems that they are grappling with.&lsquo;Someone tell Kenyans to move to Tanzania, wana shida ya unga na skin color,&rsquo; he wrote.Because Kenyans are not known to take insults when lying down, they decided to retaliate and it soon became a shouting match with the Tanzanians.Here are the reactions:Stephen Musyoka: @IdrisSultan now, repeat what you just said in English. #TZvsKEXtian Dela: Dear Kenyans, kindly tweet in Swahili on the #TZvsKE hashtag for Tanzanians to understand what we are saying.Ian Mbunde: #TZvsKE coasterians are slow but nothing compares to TZ services unaeza jipata uko retirement ukingoja kushughulikiwa.
