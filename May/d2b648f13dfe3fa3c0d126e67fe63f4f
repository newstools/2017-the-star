National
Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale’s proposed bill requiring that the IEBC
manage all party primaries three or six months before a general election is not
a good idea (see P35). It
would deny the parties the right to organise the election processes they see
fit. What’s
more, this would be an insanely expensive exercise, at least as costly as the
General Election itself. There
is no need to bog down the IEBC and the electorate in this manner. What
should happen is for the parties to invest in nominations personnel and preparedness
in such a way that they only require IEBC technical expertise. Part
of the preparations ought to be the keeping of a frequently updated and
verifiable members’ register. Duale’s
move comes in the wake of the widespread electoral malpractice witnessed in all
parties during the primaries. The
primaries must never again be as inept, thuggish, thievish and daylight robbery
of the electorate’s right to vote as they were this year.
