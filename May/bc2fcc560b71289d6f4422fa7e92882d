CoG chairman and Turkana Governor Josphat Nanok has said devolution is likely to weaken if Jubilee gets a second term.He said Jubilee has been working to undermine devolution and that the counties are likely to face serious financial constraints under its administration.&ldquo;They have been consistently withholding cash meant for the counties and even refused to let go of functions which were devolved through the Constitution,&rdquo; Nanok said yesterday.He urged Kenyans to support the opposition because &ldquo;it has leaders who struggled for devolution in the Constitution and understand what it means.&rdquo;&ldquo;All Kenyans know very well [NASA presidential flagbearer] Raila Odinga has paid the price for devolution and democracy in Kenya,&rdquo; Nanok said. He will defend his seat on the ODM ticket.
