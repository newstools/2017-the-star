Jubilee Changamwe MP candidate Abdi Daib has accused Mombasa county, KPA and JKIA of neglecting flood victims. He said despite more than 40 families residing within their vicinity, they have not helped them. “This is an issue of corporate social responsibility and the Kenya Ports Authority and the Jommo Kenyatta International Airport cannot shy away,” Daib said. He said Governor Hassan Joho’s administration failed to act “the way [Kwale Governor Salim] Mvurya did when his people were swept away.” Daib said Mvurya helped rebuild houses destroyed by rains and distributed roofing sheets. He spoke on Thursday, when he issued relief food and bedding to flood victims in Changamwe. Daib said the county should improve the drainage system. He also warned the administration against approving construction on waterways.
