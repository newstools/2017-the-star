Three Kenyan journalists were arrested in Zanzibar on Thursday for not having visas despite the lack of this requirement.They were denied entry after landing at about 10am for a drone camp training at State university of Zanzibar, which is hosting the annual ZANSEA conference.Those arrested were Kenfrey Kiberenge (Nation Media), Maxwell Agwanda (Standard Group) and Patrick Vidija (Radio Africa).Kwasi Gachie (Code for Africa Program Assistant) and two other facilitators were also held but released later.A trainer, who spoke to The Star by phone, confirmed the arrests but said they did not know what would happen next."They are still with the officers. We are worried for them," she said.Reached for comment, East African Affairs PS Betty Maina said they were not aware of the incident but would look into it."There is no requirement for visas to Zanzibar," she noted. "We are checking with our teams."A visa is not required as Zanzibar is part of the East Africa Community. Vidija said he and the two other journalists were released at about 3pm after paying $100 each for business conference visas. The facilitators were not required to pay this fee.Boniface Muhia, acting High Commissioner to Tanzania, confirmed they were released and had gone to their hotel.Story updated
