The entry of UDP leader Cyrus Jirongo into the presidential race could disrupt NASA&rsquo;s strategy, analyst Wasai Nanjakululu has said. Jirongo is among 16 presidential candidates set to face President Uhuru Kenyatta and opposition leader Raila Odinga on August 8 after clearance by the Registrar of Political Parties. On Thursday last week, Jirongo said he would mobilise resources and join the race for President if NASA flag bearer Raila Odinga does not respond to his offer of cooperation.Nanjakululu said: &ldquo;Luhyaland will decide the August elections and disruption of any kind of voting patterns in the region could cost NASA.&rdquo; He said the Luhya community has more than three million votes. Some 1.9 million of them are in Western and another 1.5m are spread across the country. Both Jubilee and NASA are plotting to win the bloc.Nanjakululu said the former Lugari MP can mobilise support, especially in Western, within a short period.&ldquo;NASA needs to marshal at least 90 per cent of the Western vote to achieve its goal. Jirongo should not be ignored because he could cause big damage on the ground,&rdquo; Nanjakululu said.Jirongo joined the Kakamega Senate race in 2013 against Boni Khalwale, and campaigned for only 10 days. He netted 138,000 votes.The analyst said NASA must devise a strategy to counter Jirongo or engage him to join the NASA family and consolidate its prospects in the region.Jirongo had earlier said he would not run for President if either ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi or Ford Kenya&rsquo;s Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula was named NASA flagbearer.He said Luhyas got a raw deal in the NASA line-up headed by Raila and Wiper&rsquo;s Kalonzo Musyoka.Yesterday Jirongo said he will go flat out to mop up the Luhya vote in Western and Nairobi county.&ldquo;NASA will know why Mudavadi was the best bet to beat Jubilee,&rdquo; he said.
