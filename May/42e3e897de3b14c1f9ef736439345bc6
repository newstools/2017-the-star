Former Deputy Speaker and aspirant for the Garissa Township parliamentary seat Farah Maalim has urged some NASA aspirants to shelve their ambitions and support one of their own. Speaking to the press in Garissa town on Sunday, Maalim said Cord lost a number of seats to Jubilee in 2013 because of fielding &ldquo;too many candidates&rdquo;. He said the scenario is likely to repeat itself if all the candidates insist on running. NASA brought together the ODM, Ford Kenya, Chama Cha Mashinani, Wiper and ANC political parties. Maalim is running on the Wiper ticket.&ldquo;NASA has the biggest chance of capturing between seven and eight additional parliamentary seats in Nairobi &ndash; if only some candidates from the coalition agree to shelve their political ambitions for the greater good of the coalition,&rdquo; he said.Maalim, who is also the Wiper party deputy leader, took issue with the losers in the party primaries. Some aspirants who failed to clinch the party&rsquo;s ticket in the nominations will run as independent candidates. He said the move will further weaken NASA.&ldquo;It is true that some of these candidates lost, not because they were not popular, but because of the low voter turnout, and in some areas the bungled party primaries. But if you really stand for a party manifesto and its ideologies, then you should stick to it,&rdquo; Maalim said.&ldquo;It is always good to maintain party discipline and demonstrate that we are able to come together irrespective of whether we won or not.&rdquo;Maalim said if the situation is not corrected now, and the NASA presidential candidate wins, the coalition will not have majority numbers in the Senate and the National Assembly.NASA affiliate parties are still negotiating the fielding of single candidates for every elective seat in Nairobi for the August 8 election. Governor Evans Kidero (ODM) and his deputy Jonathan Mueke (Wiper) early this month said strong candidates are still being identified.
