Media practitioners should be vigilant during the election period and avoid being used to achieve selfish politicians&rsquo; interests, ICT Cabinet Secretary Joe Mucheru said yesterday.The press is a powerful tool and it will be costly for Kenya if the gatekeepers in media companies compromise their vigilance and allow external forces to advance their agenda to the detriment of citizens, he said.Professional and ethicalThe media should not sacrifice objectivity, fairness and balance in coverage for the sake of profit, Mucheru said.&ldquo;As we approach this critical period in our country, I would like to urge the media to be vigilant against machinations such as using media to set personal and selfish agenda,&rdquo; he added.&ldquo;Take this as your patriotic duty to hold the country together.&rdquo;Mucheru spoke at the KICC, Nairobi, during a function to mark World Press Freedom Day.The event was organised by the Media Council of Kenya.The Day is marked every May 3. This year&rsquo;s theme is &lsquo;Critical Minds for Critical Times: Media&rsquo;s role in advancing peaceful, just and inclusive societies&rsquo;.The CS said the government has been supportive of the media and he urged the media to support development.The government has made an effort to include the freedom of the press, including online freedom, in the Constitution to improve the economy, he said.Mucheru said some countries have benefited from such freedoms in attracting direct foreign investments.&ldquo;In supporting development, I call on the media to refocus on development rather than exceptional focus on criticism of government as hallmarks of good journalism,&rdquo; the CS said.Free media = more investmentsHe said companies are more predisposed to have more business interests in countries where media freedom is respected. Part of what has made Kenya a destination choice for investors is the idea of a free press.&ldquo;It is incumbent on media practitioners to passionately support Africa&rsquo;s development agenda. There is no doubt that Africa is a rising giant despite the challenges we face,&rdquo; Mucheru said.He said there is the Smart Africa initiative that aims at creating a single digital market in the continent.&ldquo;I urge you to take interest in the idea and become champions of this concept that will uplift Africa to the pinnacle of development,&rdquo; the CS said.However, Mucheru said media freedom has been curtailed by a lack of information infrastructure, skills and literacy for access of information and critical evaluation of information.He said many people do not have access to express themselves publicly."It is incumbent on media practitioners to passionately support Africa's development agenda.
