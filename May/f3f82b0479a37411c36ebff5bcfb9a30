A war of words yesterday erupted between ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale over the 2010 Mavoko cemetery land scam.The land was purchased at an inflated price but was unusable because it was too rocky for a graveyard.Mudavadi threatened to sue Duale over the remarks he made on Saturday, linking him to the Sh283 million lsale. Duale said Mudavadi must be held responsible.Mudavadi was then Deputy Prime Minister and Local Government minister, when the purchase took place.In a statement, Mudavadi said, &ldquo;To reply to Duale&rsquo;s aspersions is to give him credit he least deserves, except to caution that he should watch his woodpecker mouth lest he land in a legal quagmire.&rdquo; He said officials at the Treasury and City Hall were responsible for the scandal, saying the decision by Duale to revive the issue is to deflect attention from the &ldquo;corrupt Jubilee regime&rdquo;.
