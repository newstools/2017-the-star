The Jubilee administration has completed projects started by former President Mwai Kibaki and the NASA Pentagon should stop intimidation and issuing threats over the government's work, President Uhuru Kenyatta said yesterday.&ldquo;They (Opposition) should stop threats because the government belongs to wananchi and that is why we had to finish projects started by Mzee Kibaki first,&rdquo; he said.Uhuru criticised opposition leaders for giving ultimatums for participating in the general election.NASA has threatened to boycott polls if an appeal filed by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission succeeds. The IEBC has appealed against the decision that Presidential results announced in constituencies are final.The IEBC wants the results to be declared final by its chairman, as the Constitution allows the commission to declare all winners during the election. &ldquo;Let people sell their agenda and stop threatening us. It is a democratic country and let us focus on development,&rdquo; Uhuru said.He spoke at Ufungamano House during the Democratic Party National Delegates Conference, which endorsed his reelection bid. He was the chief guest."People must learn that issuing threats over issues does not yield results. Kenyans want a peaceful nation and as politicians we must learn to respect the will of the people,&rdquo; Uhuru said.He urged the opposition to accept and respect the will of the people in the August 8 election.&ldquo;We ask our competitors to let the will of the people carry the day. This issue of saying that if the voting does not go your way there will be repercussions is not helping," the President said.Uhuru called for peaceful elections and a united Kenya ahead of the August polls.He further stated he will campaign for all leaders who support his reelection bid to unite the nation."True democracy is letting people make their decisions without any intimidation and we will campaign together to ensure that we sell our agenda and ensure the nation remains united," Uhuru said.DP leader Joseph Munyao said, &ldquo;Uhuru is a good leader and we will support him because he has performed.&rdquo;On May 6, four parties endorsed Uhuru as their presidential candidate during their party delegates' meetings. They are Maendeleo Chap Chap, Narc Kenya, Kanu and Economic Freedom Party.The parties said they will field candidates for all elective posts countrywide except for President.
