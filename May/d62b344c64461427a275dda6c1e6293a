Controversial artist Michael Soi has gone ham on the National Museum of Kenya for commissioning work for the Museum Day, then turning it down, claiming it has "issues revolving around nudity". Soi told Word Is, "We presented our work to the museum three days ago and a few hours later we got a call to go to the museum. They told us they 'looked at the work and felt that the work was not appropriate for our audience.' We were literary told to present either new work as an option because this would never go up in the gallery." The theme for the Museum day was "Speak The Unspeakable". Soi opted to address this issue by painting art pieces about contemporary religion. "I'm talking about all these churches popping up all over Nairobi. Basically you will hear there is this church with 100% women congregants of a certain age, and the pastor is a very questionable individual who has a formula for praying for them to get wealthy husbands. I also had a piece of a pastor who managed to convince the congregation to undress." He adds that nudity is not a viable excuse to be censored because, "If you take a trip around the museum you will see they have a segment that revolves around the development of man." Soi is also famed for the designer tote bags that went viral when Oscar wining actress Lupita Nyongo endorsed it saying “What's not to love about our @soysos2 bags?!”
