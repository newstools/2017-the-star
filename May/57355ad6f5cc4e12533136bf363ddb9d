The firm&rsquo;s bourse woes began in October 17 2016 when it was suspended from the London Stock exchange&rsquo;s Alternative Investment Market Segment. This came following the resignation of the firm&rsquo;s nominated advisor, Stifel Nicolaus Europe Limited.The nomad&rsquo;s reason for exit was that Atlas&rsquo;s speciality in the oil and gas industry did not match the firm&rsquo;s current principal activity of sports betting. The company failed to hire another nomad within the required 30 day period ultimately leading to its delisting from the LSE Alternative Investment Market Segment.Atlas closed down its operations in Kenya in 2015 after selling its assets to focus on its investment in Ethiopia, mainly to a glass manufacturing plant. This has, however, ran into headwinds following a tax dispute with authorities.
