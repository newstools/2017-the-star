The NCIC has said it should not be blamed for collapsed hate speech cases.The Witness Protection Agency and careless translators should take the blame.Director of Public Prosecution Keriako Tobiko said the National Cohesion and Integration Commission has been providing weak evidence, forcing courts to dismiss cases.Commission vice-chairperson Irene Wanyoike yesterday blamed witnesses and agencies, saying some witnesses refuse to testify. She said the NCIC Act of 2008 focuses on hate speech and ethnic contempt, is weak, contains gaps and needs to be toughened up to &ldquo;bite&rdquo;. &ldquo;We have teeth, but we need a motive,&rdquo; Wanyoike said during the sensitisation of bloggers and TV, radio, and print reporters. The Act has largely been blamed for the lack of convictions.&ldquo;The Act was hurriedly done. It needs a beef up. Judiciary has prosecution powers, and we don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said.The Act was passed after the 2007-08 post-poll violence to mainly end ethnic profiling. Some hate speech cases pushed by the NCIC have been thrown out for lack of evidence. Tobiko&rsquo;s discontent came after the court in February acquitted two members of the &ldquo;Pangani Six&rdquo;. They were MPs Moses Kuria (Gatundu)) South) and Kabete&rsquo;s Ferdinand Waititu (pictured).Senior principal magistrate Charity Oluoch ruled that the prosecution had failed to provide enough evidence to warrant a conviction. But Wanyoike said media houses refuse to allow its employees to testify in court.
