Sometime last year, Bahati was rumoured to have impregnated a girl who was in her early 20s. The gospel star denied these claims on numerous occasions. One Instagramer, Bridget June, mused, &ldquo;I remember this scandal back in 2015. You denied you never got the said girl pregnant but its good you can now acknowledge your biological daughter.&rdquo; Fast forward to May 20, 2017, the Groove Award winner, famous for his hit single Nikumbushe featuring Tanzanian playboy Rayvanny, revealed that he sired a baby girl who is now two years old. It seems the gospel star has gotten his act right and taken responsibility for his actions.When announcing the news of his heir, Bahati thanked &ldquo;the love of my life, Diana, for being there for me in all situations.&rdquo;He promised to be the &ldquo;best dad ever&rdquo; to Mueni Bahati. However, the buzz online is, who is the lady who bore the beautiful child? It is confirmed that Mueni&rsquo;s mother is college student Kisha Yvette Obura, 23.Kenyans online were salty about this: Diana Deya reacted, &ldquo;Hypocrisy is when you parade adopted kids and hide your own flesh and blood for 2 years?Mungu halali.&rdquo;While Rwandese Bebe added, &ldquo;Juu una acknowledge Diana, is she the one who gave birth? Where is Yvette, nkt, your karma is doing sit ups?&rdquo;Women online speculated about this grand announcement by Bahati wondering if it will drive a wedge between him and his &ldquo;prayer partner&rdquo;, Diana Marua.Some even asked Kisha to &ldquo;fight&rdquo; for her family.Kisha responded to all this by shutting down any rumours that she and Bahati have a thing. Or will ever have a thing in the future. She gave her official statement before committing social media suicide. The pressure was too much for her.Kisha wrote, &ldquo;Jesus Christ! I don&rsquo;t want to be with Bahati. He is just but my baby daddy/ ex. The only thing that people should know is that the baby is not adopted but my own. Thank you.&rdquo;
