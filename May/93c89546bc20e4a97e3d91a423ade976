Presidential hopeful Peter Gichira has made a last-minute attempt to compel the IEBC to let him run for office.In an urgent application, the besieged aspirant said a decision to lock him out of the race was malicious and in bad faith.He said he was likely to be excluded from participating in the August 8 General Election after the IEBC &ldquo;deliberately disobeyed court orders allowing me to submit papers&rdquo;.&ldquo;There is real apprehension that the IEBC will print ballot papers for the presidential election and completely lock me out from contesting,&rdquo; Gichira said. On Monday, he was charged with attempted suicide, malicious damage to property and creating a disturbance.He allegedly wanted to jump from the sixth floor of Anniversary Towers, where the IEBC offices are located. The incident occurred Sunday.He was released on Sh200, 000 bail after denying the charges.Gichira said the decision to reject his nomination signatures goes against the principle of legitimate expectations, since he was confident he would be cleared and given the green light to present his nomination papers after the High Court invalidated some requirements for independent presidential candidates.He wants the elections agency blocked from making preparations for the presidential election - including printing ballot papers - until the issues he raised are resolved. Last week, Justice George Odunga nullified restrictions imposed on independent presidential candidates to enlist supporters who have no political affiliation.The judge declared unconstitutional the requirement by the IEBC that independent presidential aspirants submit signatures of their 2,000 nominees from 24 counties through electronic format. Odunga ruled that Section 29 of the Elections Act - which imposed the sanctions exclusively on presidential candidates - contravened Article 27 of the Constitution that enshrines freedom from discrimination.&ldquo;I find the requirement does not meet the fairness and reasonability test as provided for under Article 24 of the Constitution,&rdquo; the judge ruled. Odunga said the requirement that presidential candidates could only be nominated by members of their political party contravenes the Constitution.
