One faction of the Njuri Ncheke Council of Elders has cursed Lands CS Jacob Kaimenyi for the second time for fuelling division among them.The group met on Saturday at the Nchiru Shrine in Tigania West and performed a ritual to curse Kaimenyi.Secretary general Josephat Murangiri and chairman Linus Kathera said Kaimenyi is fuelling division in the council by supporting a splinter group of the Njuri Ncheke.They also cursed Chuka University vice chancellor Prof Elias Njoka for allegedly disuniting the elders, leading to the council splitting into two factions.They accused the duo of using their positions in the government to disunite the council, which they say was formed about 100 years ago.We put him in power&ldquo;We are the ones who lobbied for Kaimenyi to be appointed Cabinet Secretary and we are urging President Uhuru Kenyatta to sack him and replace him with someone else,&rdquo; Murangiri said.The elders said they will march to State House should the President fail to sack Kaimenyi by June 14.The Council&rsquo;s Igembe central chairman Salesio M&rsquo;ngechu, said Kaimenyi and Njoka have colluded with former council elders Phares Rutere and Paul M&rsquo;ithinkia and have tainted the name of the Council, which warrants their excommunication.In May 2015, the same group of elders cursed Kaimenyi for failing to honour summons over controversial remarks about the Council.The CS had to part with a white, spotless bull and Sh100,000 in cash on July 7, 2015, for the elders to lift the curse.But speaking at Meru National Polytechnic, Kaimenyi said it is wrong for elders to curse him and call for his sacking.&ldquo;They are not the ones who appointed me, it&rsquo;s President Uhuru Kenyatta who appointed me. If he finds me unfit he is the one who can sack me. It is not them to tell him what to do,&rdquo; he said.The elders are also forcing old men to join the council, Kaimenyi said.&ldquo;We know the Council of Elders does not force people to join. People are selected and asked to join of their own will,&rdquo; the CS added.Is the council genuine?He questioned the legitimacy of the faction led by Kathera and Murangiri.&ldquo;They are not recognised by the Registrar of Societies. Furthermore, they went to court against the Council norms ... Which Council of Elders would be rooting for the downfall of its own people?&rdquo; Kaimenyi asked.He said he is ready to mediate between the two splinter groups and restore one Council of Elders.&ldquo;Njuri Ncheke is very respected among the Council of Elders in the country but this respect will be brought down by a few individual&rsquo;s if they are not careful,&rdquo; Kaimenyi said.
