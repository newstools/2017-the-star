A Busia woman representative aspirant has accused the incumbent Florence Mutua of failing to disburse Affirmative Action Fund to women, youth and the disabled.Speaking to the Star in Busia town on Friday, Isabella Masinde, who is vying on a Jubilee ticket, said Mutua spent a lot of her time tabling unnecessary bills in Parliament. She said needy cases which include women, youth and people with disability across the county have not been addressed.Masinde said she will use every opportunity to embark on a marathon campaign at the grassroots to ensure she wrests the seat from the incumbent. &ldquo;I am fully prepared to dislodge the incumbent from office because she has failed,&rdquo; she said.Contacted for comment, the incumbent denied the opponent&rsquo;s claim, saying she has undertaken a lot of projects which include greenhouses, buying plastic chairs for women&rsquo;s groups and other income generating activities.&ldquo;I have done a lot for women with the affirmative action fund, so those claiming the same has been misused have a sinister agenda,&rdquo; Mutua said.On January 25, the National Assembly began debate on the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Bill, 2016.The proposed law, by Mutua, sought to deny plea to sexual offenders on grounds that such cases lack evidence.The legislation, which flopped, sought to seal loopholes that sexual offenders, who defile minors and school girls, use to escape justice by negotiating with the families. Sexual offenders were to be fined Sh500,000 or jailed for five years or both if found guilty. According to the Bill, unwanted contact between body parts with breast or buttocks but does not include penetration amounts to a sexual offence.
