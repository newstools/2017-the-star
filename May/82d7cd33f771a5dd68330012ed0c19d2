The Independent Policing Oversight Authority will be monitoring the police recruitment scheduled for Thursday, May 11.The National Police Service Commission will be enlisting 10, 000 recruit constabularies in GSU, AP and regular police service units.Dennis Oketch, the IPOA spokesman, said the authority understands that entrenching professionalism in the National Police Service must start at the recruitment stage.He said IPOA will partner with the NPSC and the IG Joseph Boinnet's office to monitor the recruitment process."Professionalism, accountability and transparency are attributes and practices that have to be inculcated.""They have to be practiced by all actors from the point of recruitment of an officer all the way to their retirement," Oketch said."Recruitment is, therefore, a key component of policing which IPOA is keen to ensure is done transparently and in a manner that is accountable to the public."Oketch said IPOA remains committed to being independent, impartial and shall monitor the extent to which the NPSC (Recruitment and Appointment) Regulations, 2015 will be observed during the recruitment.The last batch of 10, 000 police constables recruited last year graduated in March, bringing the number of police officers to slightly over 100,000.
