Marsabit Governor Ukur Yatani has said ODM&rsquo;s decision to sideline some leaders propelled his exit from the party.Yatani said &lsquo;big parties&rsquo; sideline leaders from the region due to the small population of the pastoral communities.In March, the governor decamped from ODM to form Frontier Alliance Party which supports President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s reelection.He was with four other MPs, 25 MCAs and more than 300 elders representing the 15 communities living in Marsabit county.The MPs include Roba Duba (Moyale), Chachu Ganya (North Horr), Nasra Ibrahim (woman representative) and Joseph Lekuton (Laisamis). Speaking in Loiyangalani, Yatani said the pastoral communities are rich in resources but lack a force to push their agenda.Yatani said FAP would be used to push the agenda of all pastoral communities and boost their bargaining power. He added that the communities were determined to bring change to the pastoral communities. &ldquo;It is time that the communities spoke for themselves.&rdquo;Marsabit hosts 15 out of the 43 communities. Fourteen of them practice pastoralism as their central economic activity. The region population, according to the 2009 census, is 291,166. &ldquo;When we were on the opposition side we were marginalised and were not given an equal opportunity in the party because they said we had no numbers,&rdquo; Yatani said. The party is fielding candidates in Marsabit, Isiolo, Samburu and Laikipia counties. The Marsabit leaders in 2013 joined TNA but later defected to ODM, citing neglection.&ldquo;We will support Uhuru&rsquo;s reelection because that is the wish of the people living in this region. The people were impressed with the recent development projects that had taken more than 50 years to be implemented, among them is the Isiolo-Moyale highway,&rdquo; Yatani said.
