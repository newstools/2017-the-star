There are more than 250 state corporations and Treasury CS Henry Rotich says these are too many.Rotich said some perform duplicate roles and should be merged or scrapped to improve efficiency and cut wastage. At a meeting with chairmen and CEOs of state corporations held at the Kenya School of Government yesterday, the CS received rare support from the chairman of the Strategic Food Reserve, Noah Wekesa, who said his organisation should be merged with the National Drought Management Authority, which performs closely related duties. Both also duplicate some functions with the National Cereals and Produce Board. &ldquo;We have created too many institutions which leads to failure in service delivery. It is not necessary for an authority to deliver government services, they can be delivered through ministries,&rdquo; Rotich said. &ldquo;Some ministries have become shells and only deal with policy.&rdquo; Rotich said the Enterprise Bill to merge the state corporations is before the Cabinet, after which it will be taken to the National Assembly.He warned state corporations that do not remit statutory deductions and taxes to the KRA. &ldquo;We will link IFMIS (a financial management system) and iTax to your institutions. As soon as money lands in any agency, the first thing, if you have not complied with KRA, money is deducted automatically at source,&rdquo; he said.He reminded the chairmen and CEOs that the largest segment of Kenya's population now is of youth aged between 19 and 30 years, who are impatient and need services to be delivered efficiently.
