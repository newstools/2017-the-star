Nairobi Diaries star Bridget Achieng has come hard at Huddah for not accepting that she bleached her skin. During an interview with Kiss FM, Bridget was asked why she bleached her skin yet she claims she's confident about herself. She went ahead to state that while growing up, she never had anyone to tell her that she was beautiful and she is proud of herself for bleaching. While still at it, she declared that she has always admitted to bleaching her skin, unlike some people who don't want to admit that they bleached. "I'm proud of myself and that's why I've said on many occasions that I've bleached my skin. I could as well say I didn't like some people. Huddah has never accepted that she's bleached and we all know that's not her original skin colour," Bridget said. She added that she's planning to go back to her original skin colour.
