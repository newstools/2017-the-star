The government has sent homicide pathologists to Eldoret to carry out postmortem on the bodies of three murdered children of Kapsoya MCA aspirant James Ratemo. Their burial, scheduled for tomorrrow, has been postponed until sometime next week. They were murdered last week and their bodies dumped in River Nzoia. Speculation has swirled about politics, a family feud and disputed land. Family lawyer Charles Nyamweya yesterday said they are yet to get clearance from the Uasin Gishu county government to bury the children at their home in Eldoret town. “We had planned to bury the children tomorrow but considering the way things are, we will not do so until next week,”Nyamweya told reporters at their home in Eldoret. Clifford Nyamweya ( 7 ), Dan Nyamweya ( 5 ) and Glen Ongaki ( 3 ) were reported missing on May 13, and their bodies recovered from River Nzoia on Friday. The homicide experts will determine how the children were killed. Initial DCI investigations showed the children were tortured, their fingers chopped off, eyes gouged out and their throats slit before their bodies were dumped in the river more than 60 kilometres from their home. Nyamweya said public health experts had already surveyed the home in Eldoret town to establish if it was possible to bury the children at the home but the county government was yet to give approval. “We are hoping that by the end of this week, we will be through with the postmortem and other requirements with police so that we can finalise burial arrangements,” Nyamweya said. The home is on Kapsoya estate, and environment agency Nema will have to give its approval for the burial. Ratemo is vying for the Kanu ticket. Onsase, the children’s uncle, was not charged with murder after the prosecution asked for 10 days to complete investigations. “I am innocent and I have not been told who saw me with the children as claimed,” Onsase said, though he could not yet enter a formal plea. Chief magistrate Charles Obulutsa granted the prosecution more time to remanded Onsase. The motive has not been determined, though there has been speculation about politics, a family feud and land dispute. State counsel Zachary Omwenga told the court they needed time to complete the probe in Eldoret and Trans Nzoia, where the bodies of the three children were found. “This is a serious matter of public interest, involving children who enjoy protection under the Constitution. We need time to carry out thorough investigations. We even have to get mobile phone data from Nairobi as part of the investigations,” Omwenga said. Obulutsa ruled that Onsase should be produced in court on June 6, when the abduction charges he was facing will be substituted with murder. Witnesses have claimed they saw the three murdered children with Onsase in Eldoret town moments after they were abducted.
