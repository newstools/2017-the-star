Former league champions Sofapaka have been boosted by the return of key players from injury ahead of their crucial SportPesa League tie against giant killers Nzoia Sugar at Sudi Stadium in Bungoma tomorrow. Veteran defender Humphrey Okoti, who last played during their 1-0 win over AFC Leopards last month, is back after missing five matches due to hamstring injury and is expected to be a major boost for the Betika-sponsored side. Team captain George Maelo and veteran midfielder Charles Okwemba are also back for the nail biting duel. Maelo, who has been out for more than six matches. He a part in the team’s 0-0 draw against Kariobangi Sharks at Narok Stadium last weekend and is expected to start tomorrow, after gaining match fitness while Okwemba, who missed the team’s last match due to stomach upset, has fully recovered and would certainly cause Nzoia Sugar defenders trouble. “I am happy with the return of some of my key players. We missed their services and I’m sure we will feel their impact in our last two matches of the league’s first leg,” said Ssimbwa before the team left for Bungoma by road. He added: “So far, apart from small knocks, Moses Odhiambo is our only player still on the injury list as he nurses a torn minicus. He has started light training with the team.”
