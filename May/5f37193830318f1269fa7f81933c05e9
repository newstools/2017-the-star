Gatundu North MP aspirant Patrick Karigi, popularly known as Wamaritha, has told opponents to stop spreading propaganda that he has dropped out to support them. The Maendeleo Chap Chap nominee called for mature politics. Karigi spoke to journalists on Wednesday in Kamwangi. He said he ditched the Jubilee Party after losing to radio personality Wanjiku Kibe in the primaries because the nominations were not free and fair. They were full of malpractices and in some instances there was ballot stuffing and multiple voting, Karigi said. “Those spreading rumours and propaganda are the same people who stole the nominations, denying the Gatundu North electorate the right to put in office the leaders of their choice,” he said. Karigi urged voters to elect leaders who will move the constituency forward. He denied allegations that he is in the opposition, insisting that MCC backs President Uhuru Kenyatta’s reelection. Karigi will be contesting against Kibe, and incumbent MP Kigo Njenga and former MP Clement Waibara, who are running as independents.
