Manufacturers have been urged to adopt waste water management practices in order to reduce their water bill and avert challenges arising from water rationing.&ldquo;If all companies would embark on waste water treatment and recycling, the current water rationing challenges would greatly be reduced. The effect would be lower demand for water and reduced cost of water among other benefits,&rdquo; Environment and Natural Resources CS Judi Wakhungu (pictured) said yesterday at the launch of Nestle&rsquo;s Sh47 million waste water recycling plant in Nairobi.The new plant is expected to produce more than 13,000 litres of treated water daily when at full capacity, an amount expected to reduce the firm&rsquo;s demand for water by 30 per cent and its water bill by Sh2.4 million annually.Wakhungu said that through the adoption of water treatment practices, firms could avoid the effects of the prolonged drought that led to water rationing in Nairobi county which have gravely affected industrial activities over the past few months.In April, the Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company announced that levels at the Ndakaini Dam which supplies 84 per cent of the city&rsquo;s water, had dropped to an all-time low of less than 25 per cent.&ldquo;On Saturday I was at the dam and it has only risen up to 31 per cent, Wakhungu said.
