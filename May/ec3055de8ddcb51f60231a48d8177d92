A Pokot chief was almost beaten after allegedly leaving out names of old starving women from the list of relief food beneficiaries at Lodengo in Tiaty, Baringo county, on Thursday.Kakabul location chief Daniel Lekewa did not include 80-year-old Chepochebunyo Mekela and 70-year-old Chepurai Riamatukei in his list of those to get food from the Red Cross.The relief agency partnered with the government and Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital.The women are among more than 10,000 hunger-stricken residents, who have suffered the impacts of the prolonged droughts.Kolowa division assistant county commissioner Rogers Ochieng&rsquo; and Red Cross North Rift regional manager Michael Ayabei calmed the angry residents before they could descend on the chief. Lekewa said not everybody could get &ldquo;the inadequate food&rdquo;.&ldquo;I think it is not time to quarrel. It&rsquo;s also good to hear from him. We are here as his bosses,&rdquo; Ochieng&rsquo; said. One resident said, &ldquo;This chief lists names based on his political affiliation, leaving out the weakest and neediest people.&rdquo;
