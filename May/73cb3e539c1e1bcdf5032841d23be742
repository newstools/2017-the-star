A key parliamentary watchdog panel yesterday cleared Kisii Governor James Ongwae (pictured) of irregularities in connection with the procurement of ambulances from the Kenya Red Cross.A report by the Auditor General for 2014-15 accused the county of violating procurement laws by engaging services from the charity organisation without a valid contract.&ldquo;I can see the procedure was accordingly followed upon perusal of documents. Because the county government could not foresee the delay, it was proper to continue engaging the services of Red Cross,&rdquo; Nyong&rsquo;o said. &ldquo;The onus to prove the delay is on the supplier and not on the governor, the query is therefore cleared.&rdquo; Nyong&rsquo;o ruled. The county made payments to Kenya Red Cross for the lease of an ambulance for three months after the valid contract expired.The contract expired on October 22, 2014, but the county went on to make authorised payments worth Sh5.7 million until January 2015.Yesterday, Ongwae said the county made arrangements to procure its ambulances but their delivery delayed, occasioning the extension of the Red Cross contract.&ldquo;The delay was not foreseen but to ensure services were uninterrupted, we decided to engage the services of Red Cross until our ambulances were delivered,&rdquo; Ongwae told the committee chaired by Kisumu Senator Anyang Nyong&rsquo;o.He said the supplier wrote to the county, saying the delivery would delay, making the county extend the contract.
