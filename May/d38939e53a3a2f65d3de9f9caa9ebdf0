The NASA coalition takes its vote hunt to Mumias East subcounty in Kakamega county tomorrow.Mumias East is Jubilee regional point man Ben Washiali&rsquo;s home turf.Experts say the decision to take its first rally to Mumias town could be to neutralise Washiali.NASA leaders Raila Odinga (ODM), Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper), Musalia Mudavadi (ANC), Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula (Ford Kenya) and CCM&rsquo;s Isaac Rutto are expected to attend the rally.The opposition leaders will attend the burial of former Mumias constituency MP Francis Obongita at Malaha village before proceeding to the rally.It will be the first rally by NASA in the region since unveiling Raila as its flagbearer and Kalonzo his running mate on April 27.Mudavadi, the NASA National Campaign Committee chairman, said on Tuesday the opposition will mount the mother of all campaigns to eclipse Jubilee in all spheres.&ldquo;We will take on Jubilee on the ground, in the air and even in the seas in the Unga revolution. Ours is called the NASA armada, sparing no Jubilee remnants. We&rsquo;re sweeping through the country in a strategy of the mole that burrows underground at the roots. That&rsquo;s how easy it will be to fell Jubilee thunderously like a giant,&rdquo; he said.The coalition will launch its official campaigns in Kakamega on June 3, according to the campaign programme released by Mudavadi. Jubilee is said to be planning to also launch its campaigns in the region in coming weeks.Meanwhile, Mudavadi will meet all ANC aspirants in Kakamega tomorrow morning before heading to the funeral and rally.The meeting comes amid complaints by his ANC followers that he had abandoned the party and concentrated on NASA affairs.The officials say Mudavadi&rsquo;s appointment to lead the NASA presidential campaigns was meant to keep him busy in national politics so ODM can snatch seats in Western.NASA has split its campaign into four groups to cover every corner of the country.Although Raila &rsquo;s presidential campaign will have different departments of the secretariat operating from different locations, it will have one presidential secretariat with a clear chain of command, with the five principals at the top, the Pentagon.One team will be led by Raila and will include Wetang&rsquo;ula, Lamu Governor Issa Timamy, Kajiado boss David Nkedianye and Narok governor aspirant Joseph Tiampati.The second team will be led by Mudavadi. His team will comprise ODM deputy party leader and Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho, new Council of Governors chairman Josphat Nanok, who is also Turkana governor, Rutto and Aisha Jumwa, the Kilifi woman representative.The third team will be led by Deputy President candidate Kalonzo Musyoka. The fourth team is comprised of Suna East MP Junet Mohamed, Wajir Governor Ahmed Abdullahi and Mombasa woman representative Mishi Mboko.
