NASA co-principal Moses Wetang'ula has been cleared by IEBC to defend his seat in the Senate. Wetang'ula bragged that he does not need to campaign as he will easily win the polls. "I will concentrate on campaigning for NASA throughout the country to ensure we send the corrupt Jubilee regime home," he said on Monday. Wetang'ula will be facing off with ODM's Bony Nyongesa in the August 8 polls. "Let him brave himself for an uphill task; this will be the mother of all battles and I am sure I will trounce him," the Bungoma Senator said. He said he will not accept results form a rigged election. "IEBC should ensure a free and fair process, failure to which the country will land in trouble," he said. He also warned Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery against being used by Jubilee and NCIC chair Francis ole Kaparo to intimidate opponents. "We all know that freedom of speech and expression and fair comment are
all rights that are enshirined in our constitution and nobody is going
to criminalise anyone during this 2017 campaigns," he said. “We want to
warn Kaparo that his role is not deprive us out fundamental  freedom of speech,” he added. He said as NASA they will not engage in hatred and propaganda; they will only tell the electorate the truth about rampant graft in the Jubilee administration. Wetang'ula was accompanied by, among others, Kalonzo Musyoka, Bonny Khalwale, and Mutula Kilonzo Jr.
