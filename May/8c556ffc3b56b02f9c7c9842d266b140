The 29,900 tonnes of maize imported last week is Mexican white maize transhipped to Kenya through South Africa, the government has clarified.Transport PS Paul Maringa yesterday said South Africans had imported maize last year from Mexico when they faced an acute shortage.The excess maize was stored in Durban and sold to Kenya by Inter Africa Grains PTY of Johannesburg, he said.Maringa spoke at the Port of Mombasa as he witnessed the offloading of the maize and the standard gauge railway wagons.Maringa said private millers, not the government, imported the maize.The millers are Kitui Flour Mills, Pembe Flour Mills and Hydery (P) Ltd.The importation followed a tax exemption notice on maize by the Kenya Revenue Authority on May 4.Kitui and Pembe Flour Mills imported 10,000 tonnes each and Hydery imported 9,900 tonnes.&ldquo;The ship only takes five days to sail from South Africa, and that is why the maize arrived quickly,&rdquo; Maringa said.He said the importing firms will share the maize with other millers to ensure even distribution throughout the country.&ldquo;We expect the millers to reciprocate the government&rsquo;s [gesture] by expediting the production process so wananchi can start accessing the flour on supermarket shelves soon,&rdquo; Maringa said.He said unga prices are expected to go down with the increase in supply.Maringa said another ship, the MV Interlink Priority, is expected to dock at the Port of Mombasa on May 24 with 37,050 tonnes of maize.He said as the government puts interventions in place to lower unga prices, it recognises there is need to protect the local farmer and Kenyan enterprises.&ldquo;That is why Agriculture CS Willy Bett indicated that importation is done in a careful manner not to jeopardise the position of our farmers this season,&rdquo; Maringa said.The government will allow the importation of six million bags of duty-free maize up to September.On Sunday, Agriculture PS Richard Lesiyampe said the window will close in early October.
