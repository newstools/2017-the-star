The story of David and Goliath in the Bible motivated me to run for Murang’a senate, says Kiharu MP Irungu Kang’ata. The first-time MP said the Bible, his favourite book, made him conquer the ‘underdog’ mentality, which made him trounce incumbent Kembi Gitura in the Jubilee Party primaries. “I have read the story many times and it gives me hope that even the smallest or weakest of us have a chance to leave a mark. And that is what I pray for,” the MP said. Speaking to the Star on Friday, the lawmaker said he has always ensured the needs of the people come first. “I thought of becoming Murang’a senator after I realised that I have more to offer to the larger county after serving my people for five years in Kijaru. And I thank God that I clinched the Jubilee ticket,” Kang’ata said. Kang’ata beat Gitura by more than 10,000 and garnered 158,164 votes against his rival’s 146,207. The MP has been vocal in the fight against corruption and has been pushing for fairness and good governance. “I also do not advocate for politics in church because that is where we go to worship,” he said “I have been voted as one of the top performing MPs serving the common mwananchi is my calling.”
