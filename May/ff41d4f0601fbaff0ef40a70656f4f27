Small parties that endorsed President Uhuru Kenyatta's reelection will each get a Cabinet post and other goodies if Jubilee wins the election.In a frantic courtship of small parties that had declined to merge with JP, and some that have cropped up, Jubilee will reward them with lucrative parastatal appointments and plum diplomatic postings.The Star has established that the number of slots for each party will be determined by the performance of each party in the polls on August 8.By wooing these parties Jubilee hopes to consolidate its support and penetrate NASA zones. After the big Tuko Pamoja Jubilee merger in September last year, the parties that refused to merge were treated like the opposition. Now they are embraced and catered to, as long as they support UhuRuto.They still may field candidates for other posts.Last Saturday, six parties separately held special National Delegates Conferences and supported Uhuru's reelection. They are Narc Kenya, Kanu, Maendeleo Chap Chap, the Economic Front Party, Frontier Alliance Party and the Kenya Patriotic Party.Yesterday Kanu secretary general Nick Salat told the Star on the phone that the Jubilee Party has entered into a post-election deal with small affiliates so each will get "at least a stake in the next government"."The law allows political parties to enter into pre- or post-election agreements. Kanu, among other parties, hase agreed to work with the President and we will be represented in all aspects of the next government," he said.He added, "Government is not a small unit. It is large enough to accommodate all the parties. There are Cabinet slots, diplomatic and other positions that Kanu and the rest of us will be asking for."On Saturday last week, President Uhuru disclosed that his government will fully accommodate all the parties, should Jubilee Party emerge the winner.&ldquo;The foundation of Kanu is unity and I believe that by being united we will win in August and I promise we will all be in government,&rdquo; Uhuru told Kanu delegates at Kasarani Stadium. &ldquo;We will be coming to Mandera very soon to ask for votes and we will work with your leaders to tap resources for the benefit of Mandera residents and Kenyans at large," he told the Economic Freedom Party convention at Nyayo Stadium."I assure you that you will be part of my government."Marsabit Governor Ukur Yatani, leader of the Frontier Alliance Party, said they will support the reelection of UhuRuto not only because of their development record in the Northern region but because Uhuru will accommodate the community.&ldquo;We have decided to support President Kenyatta because we are confident that only by working with him will we achieve our development aspirations," Yatani said.It it is no longer mandatory for civil servants seeking election to resign six months to the elections.Sources at State House told the Star, however, that Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua is carrying out an audit of posts that may have been vacated in the national government after office holders quit to join politics.The positions will be reserved until after the elections when they will be dished out to the various parties.The Employment and Labour Relations Court in Kericho struck down the quit-office provision of Section 43(5) of the Elections Act of 2011, calling it unconstitutional and without legal basis.The orders issued in March quashed a letter written by Kinyua on December 1, 2016, which required public servants eyeing election to vacate office on or before February 7.Already several vacancies have been created, especially in the diplomatic corps and in parastatals, as envoys, chairmen and members quit to try their luck in lucrative politics.Some of them got tickets in the just-concluded party primaries while others have opted to be independent candidates.There is a vacancy in the Anti-Female Genital Mutilation Board, as outgoing chairperson Jebii Kilimo is running for Marakwet East MP. Kilimo lost to incumbent MP Kangogo Bowen in the JP primaries, opting to run as independent. He said the nominations were not fair and transparent.Another position that will be reserved is that of the chairman of the Industrial and Commercial Development Corporation. Former secretary to the Cabinet Francis Kimemia is set to quit and run for Nyandarua governor after clinching the JP ticket.It is not clear if former Industrialisation minister Henry Kosgey resigned as chairman of the Tourism Fund as he ran against Nandi Governor Cleophas Lagat. Both were defeated by Nandi Senator Stephen Sang.Omingo Magara, seeking the Kisii Senate seat on his Peoples Democratic Party ticket, will relinquish chairmanship of the Kenyatta International Convention Centre.Former Information and Communication minister Samuel Poghisio, running for West Pokot senator, has also resigned as chairman of the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority.Chirau Mwakwere, who has been the Kenyan High Commissioner to Tanzania, has tendered his resignation, as he seeks the Kwale governor's job on a Wiper ticket.Kalembe Ndile of the Water Services Regulatory Board will step down before he can try to recapture the Kibwezi parliamentary seat.President Uhuru's political adviser Joshua Kuttuny will also resign. Kuttuny won the JP ticket and he plans to recapture his Cherangany parliamentary seat. Former Moyale MP Mohamud Mohamed Ali will resign from the National Hospital Insurance Fund in a bid to recapture his seat.Former aide de camp of President Mwai Kibaki, Retired Colonel Geoffrey King&rsquo;ang&rsquo;i, will resign as chairman of the of the National Cereals and Produce Board to contest the Mbeere South seat.Some public servants have already tendered their resignations, including Ombudsman Otiende Amollo, chairman of the Commission on Administrative of Justice, who is eyeing the Rarieda seat.
