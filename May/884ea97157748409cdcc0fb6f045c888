After nearly four months of severe drought that claimed more than two per cent of livestock in Garissa county, torrential rains have left Dadaab subcounty heavily flooded.The rains started two weeks ago, but on Tuesday night, Dadaab that hosts three refugee camps of Ifo, Hagadera and Daghaley, received a heavy downpour that lasted more than five hours. The rains left homes submerged and disrupted public transport.County director of meteorology Samwel Odhiambo said Dadaab received 110mm of rains, one of the highest on record in the recent past.the last time Garissa recorded good rains was in October and December of 2015, when it received 158mm. &ldquo;Although the 2015 rain was below the average of 190mm, it remains the best since then,&rdquo; Odhiambo said. &ldquo;The rains should not create an impression the area is now off the hook. We are still doing water trucking in Lagdera and parts of Dadaab.&rdquo;The rain is good news for pastoralists, who lost their livestock to drought.Kenya Livestock Marketing Council chairman Dubat Amey urged the government to prepare early for a possible outbreak of waterborne diseases by stocking drugs in public health facilities in the flooded areas.
