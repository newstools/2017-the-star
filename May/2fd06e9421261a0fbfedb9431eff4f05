Commercial loans taken by the government more than doubled in 10 months of financial year 2016-17 compared to a year earlier, official Exchequer data shows. National Treasury CS Henry Rotich says in the Statement of Actual Revenue and Net Exchequer Issues that loans between July 2016 and April 2017 jumped to Sh167.14 billion from Sh74.33 billion in the same period previously. This is a rise of Sh92.81 billion, or 124.86 per cent, according to the data published monthly in the Kenya Gazette on Friday. The upgrade of Kenya's economy to lower middle-income status following a rebase in September 2014 largely locked the country out of concessional loans, largely from World Bank Group's International Development Association. &ldquo;Following Kenya&rsquo;s elevation to lower middle income economy status in September 2014,recourse to borrowing on commercial and semi-concessional terms has increased while that on concessional terms has declined,&rdquo; the Central Bank of Kenya said in the quarterly Economic Review for October-December released on April 18. The Kenya Revenue Authority collected Sh989.94 billion between July and April this financial year, the data shows, a growth of 11.46 per cent, or Sh101.82 billion, compared to Sh888.12 billion total tax collected the year before. This is, however, a marginal Sh66.06 billion, or 6.26 per cent, off the Sh1.267 trillion revised full-year total tax income estimates on pro rata basis. Tax collection accounted for 63.33 per cent of Sh1.563 trillion total revenue the government generated in the 10-month period. This was Sh148 billion, or 10.46 per cent, more than Sh1.415 trillion realised in the first 10 months of the 2015-16 financial year. The revenue underperformed the Sh1.712 trillion target on pro rata basis by Sh149 billion, or 8.70 per cent. Treasury in the Quarterly Economic and Budgetary Review report to the National Assembly earlier this month, said revenue generation this financial year has been hurt largely by shortfalls in income tax. Other areas which have suffered shortfalls are collections from fees, charges and court fines as well as investment income and Imports Declaration Fee. Non-tax revenue in the 10 months to April 2017 grew by a fifth, rising 24.91 per cent to Sh39.76 billion, the Treasury data shows. Grants from foreign government and international organisations rose nearly two-fold, climbing 185.05 per cent to Sh23.66 billion from Sh8.43 billion previously. The Treasury says net domestic borrowing dropped by Sh118.79 billion, or 31.44 per cent, to Sh259.04 billion from Sh377.83 billion in April 2017. The government has a revised target of Sh423.65 billion for full-year period to June 30. Grants from the peacekeeping African Union Mission in Somalia went down by 15.85 per cent to Sh4.97 billion.
