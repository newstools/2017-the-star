Lawyers representing the family of former nominated MP Mark Too are demanding Sh12.5 million from Simon Lilan, who filed a case to block his burial at his farm in Eldoret in January.Lawyer Steve Biko said they want Lilan to pay the money as costs of the case he filed against the family and several other prominent people, including Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi.Biko said Lilan should foot the costs because he went to court, well knowing the consequences, which included costs for those involved.&ldquo;We have already filed our bill of costs and the case was to come up for hearing but the relevant file could not be traced&rdquo; Biko said.The case was to come up before Deputy Registrar of the High Court Harrison Barasa. It will be mentioned on June 14 to establish if the file has beentraced.The lawyers include Evans Monari, Professor Tom Ojienda and Gladys Boss Shollei. Biko appeared in court on their behalf.Lilan has not filed his response but has confirmed he will. He had moved to the High Court and obtained a temporary order stopping the burial of Too on January 9, But the lawyers teamed up and convinced the court to lift the orders. Then the burial took place in the presence of President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto, among others.Lilan had argued Too may have been killed due to his political influence and vast wealth. He wanted investigations done to establish the cause of Too&rsquo;s death.
