Kiambu Governor William Kabogo has blamed the United for Kiambu group led by Kabete MP Ferdinand Waititu for his loss in the Jubilee party primaries.Kabogo said the group used propaganda to tarnish his name and ruin his track record.While speaking on Radio Jambo on Wednesday, Kabogo stated that he will be vindicated on the accusations by God and the people of Kiambu in August."I have never insulted women in Kiambu or anywhere else because I hold them highly. The allegations which were put forward to the people were just political," he said.".......they should know that I am back and this time I will be ready to ensure the people of Kiambu get the leadership they deserve," Kabogo added.Read: Kabogo concedes defeat as Waititu widens gap in Kiambu Jubilee primariesKabogo who is defending his seat as an Independent candidate, however, affirmed his support for President Uhuru Kenyatta's reelection bid."
