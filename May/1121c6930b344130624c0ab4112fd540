Farmers in Trans Nzoia have been urged to join cooperative societies to benefit from the Mt Elgon Livelihood project and improve their income.Regional VI Agro-forestry officer Edward Masinde said the project is operating and targets farmers through saccos and groups. The project was rolled out in April 2016.He was speaking in Endebess subcounty on Wednesday.Masinde said through the project, farmers are trained in good farming practices through land management. They are also taught how to improve dairy farming and access markets for their produce. Training centres have been set up. &ldquo;We shall provide all services including linking you to good AI services and Agricultural Extension Services &mdash; only if you are in cooperative societies,&rdquo; he said.The official said the project encourages members to grow their own cattle feed because hay is expensive. Farmers will get free seeds to start them off. The officer said they have identified 15 saccos, which they are working with.&ldquo;We have employed two extension officers in each cooperative society to help stabilise them as we ensure good farming practices are adopted,&rdquo; Masinde said.He said the livelihood project is partnering with Brookside and East African Marketing Development Associates, with funding from the European Union. Masinde said more than 30,000 smallholder farmers will access funds.Mubere Cooperative Society, which was recently upgraded from a Community-Based Organisation, partnered with the project.The agreement has stabilised the cost of milk for members&rsquo; produce despite fluctuations in national prices. Farmers were urged to buy insurance for their crops and animals.
