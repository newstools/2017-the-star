Marion Kibor of Kahawa Barracks bagged a hat-trick of titles when she retained the 3000m crown on the second day of the 2017 Kenya Defence Forces Athletics Championships at the Nyayo Stadium yesterday.Kibor ran a tactful race from the word go in the warm conditions to romp home in 9:56.40 beating decorated Mercy Wanjiru Njoroge to second in 10:07.0 as Elizabeth Mueni bagged the bronze medal 10:23.3.Joylene Mutai finished fourth in 10:30.0.The race, which featured only six runners started a slow pace with Wanjiru surging to the front at the start of the second lap with Mueni and Kibor keeping close tabs. By the start of the fourth lap the battle was between the three athletes with the lead changing hands between Mueni and Kibor.In the sixth lap, Kibor powered to the front and accelerated, closely followed by Wanjiru with Mueni dropping off. At the bell, Kibor increased the tempo once more with Wanjiru unable to respond, dropping further behind with Kibor ensured of victory, although in a sluggish time.Kibor said there is room for improvement ahead of the national trials next month where she will be up against the likes of world champion Hyving Kiyeng alongside a galaxy of other top elite runners.&ldquo;It was a tricky race and at one point I found the pace too slow and had to take the initiative. But come the national championships, I think I can ran faster and compete against the best in the country,&rdquo; added Kibor.Seven-time Africa walk race champion Grace Wanjiru cruised to victory in the 20km event. Wanjiru was a cut above the competition in the event held in the early morning hours and showed her pedigree by posting 1:34:15 with Linda Waweru coming home second 10 minutes later.Ruth Wangui took the last podium position in 1:47:52 as Chepngetich Kosgey (1:48:34) and Mary Njoki (2:01.26) completed the top five places. Wanjiru has set her sights on seeking qualification to the World Championship if Athletics Kenya can give her chance to compete.&ldquo;I competed once in 2011 in Daegu South Korea but I am hoping I can be given another chance to go compete at the world event in London,&rdquo; said Wanjiru.Simon Wachira bagged the men&rsquo;s title by registering 1:24:18 with the ever-green former national champion and veteran David Kimutai second in 1:31:35. Nicodemus Musau placed third in 1:33:01 followed by Hezbon Ndiema (1:36:49) and guest runner Yusuf Masera (1:42:46).Mary Tanui clinched the women&rsquo;s 100m title after clocking 12:0. Roselyne Indimuli placed second in 12.1 with Sabina Mukoswa third in 12.2 ahead of Priscilla Tabunda (12.4).
