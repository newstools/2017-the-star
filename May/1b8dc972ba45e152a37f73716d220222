The Nairobi government&rsquo;s Sh35.9 billion 2017-18 budget was passed unlawfully and risks being declared null and void.The process will have to start all over again.The Star has established the Public Finance Management Act, which guides the process, was violated. The county Treasury published the Appropriations Bill &mdash; authorising expenditure &mdash; before MCAs passed the budget estimates, thus violating the law.Section 129 ( 7 ) of the Act reads, &ldquo;Upon approval of the budget estimates by the county assembly, the CEC member for Finance shall prepare and submit a County Appropriation Bill to the assembly of approved estimates.&rdquo;Assembly Clerk Jacob Ngwele said a voter pointed out the problem.&ldquo;Yes, there was an anomaly and we are consulting on the next move. The law is very clear, the estimates must be passed before the Bill is introduced,&rdquo; he said. Ngwele said the Bill was published on March 5, but the assembly passed the estimates on March 4.He blamed the county Treasury for publishing the Bill before confirming estimates had been passed. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know why they were in a hurry to publish the Bill. They should have waited for clearance from us before they move ahead,&rdquo; Ngwele said.&ldquo;Anybody can now move to court and challenge the budget. But that is a risk we cannot take. We are planning to start the process afresh.&rdquo;County Attorney Gad Awuonda yesterday said the bill would be republished but accused the assembly of making trouble.&ldquo;The assembly is being mischievous. They are the custodian of the dates and they should have communicated to us,&rdquo; he told the Star on the phone.The county has until June 30 to publish the Appropriations Bill. The process was concluded hastily so there would be a quorum before MCAs fled to campaign in primaries.
