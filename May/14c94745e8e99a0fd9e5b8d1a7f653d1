CID officers are analysing mobile phone communications by the prime suspect in the murder of the three children of Kapsoya MCA aspirant James Ratemo to establish if other people were involved.Data from suspect Enock Onsase has been taken to Nairobi for analysis to help in the investigations before he returns to court on June 6 to possibly face murder charges.Uasin Gishu county acting police chief Samuel Mutunga says the investigations are going on well. They expect to finalise the details within the 10 days given by the court last week.&ldquo;We are on the matter which we are taking seriously to establish details of the crime,&rdquo; Mutunga said.When he appeared in court on Tuesday last week, Onsase said he is innocent and asked chief magistrate Charles Obulutsa to have his mobile phone handed back, but the court rejected the request.&ldquo;The mobile phone is being used for investigations and police can help the suspect communicate through other means,&rdquo; Obulutsa said.Clifford Nyamweya, seven, Dan Nyamweya, five, and Glen Ongaki, three, will be buried at Nyacheke village in Kisii on June 9. A postmortem was conducted at the Moi Referral Hospital on Friday.Pathologists said the three children were strangled to death before their bodies were thrown into River Nzoia.A postmortem carried out led by Dr Keittany Kibet revealed the children lacked air in the lungs, an indication they had been strangled.&ldquo;Our finding is they had a lot of bleeding around the neck, pointing towards strangulation. The challenge we had is the bodies had decomposed, having not been preserved for more than three days,&rdquo; Kibet said.
