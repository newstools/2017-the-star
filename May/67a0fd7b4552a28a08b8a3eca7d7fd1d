The subsidised maize flour introduced by the Jubilee government is yet to reach rural areas, Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto has said. The CCM leader said families upcountry are starving because they cannot access the flour, which is only available in urban shops. Rutto said the flour made from imported maize from Mexico and South Africa has been stocked in major supermarkets, which many Kenyans do not shop in. He spoke at Olbutyo trading centre, Chepalungu constituency, on Saturday during a CCM rally. &ldquo;In fact, they do not require the flour but grains since they are not used to this habit of purchasing already milled flour,&rdquo; he said. Rutto claimed &ldquo;politically correct unscrupulous businessmen&rdquo; colluded in mopping up maize to create artificial shortages, and later released the commodity to the market to cushion the &lsquo;shortage&rsquo;.
