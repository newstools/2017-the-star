Nominated MP Isaac Mwaura has dismissed the reentry of former Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth in the Nairobi governor race.He termed as ill-advised, the decision by the former legislator to seek the seat as an independent candidate.Mwaura on Sunday urged Kenneth to bow out of the competition honourably and seek to vie for the same another time.He exuded confidence that Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko will clinch the seat."Peter Kenneth, there is great wisdom in knowing when to fight and when to bow out of the race.""Sonko is our candidate. He may have his flaws but when the contest is over, we all rally behind our nominee," he said."You are someone I have backed before in this race but on this one...I think it is an ill-advised move," Mwaura said.He made the sentiments on his official Facebook page."You will lose only coming a distant third despite your impeccable credentials. You should have lived to fight another day," he added.Kenneth ditched Jubilee Party and announced that he will vie for Nairobi governor as an independent candidate.The 2013 Presidential aspirant was floored by Sonko, said the primaries were shambolic and that there was no response on the malpractice concerns he raised with the party.The aspirant said he will unveil his running mate next week.He is facing off with against Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko (Jubilee) and ODM's Evans Kidero.Mwaura lost in the Ruiru MP Jubilee party primaries garnering 4,632 votes against his opponent Simon King'ara's 10,900.The MP conceded defeat, describing his bid as a debut for a person with albinism and also a youth, having run for a high level political office.Read: Isaac Mwaura concedes defeat in Ruiru Jubilee MP pollsAlso read: Mwaura discharged from hospital after 'assassination' claims
