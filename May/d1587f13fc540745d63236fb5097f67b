Independents in Nyanza will have a tough time campaigning, after NASA presidential flagbearer Raila Odinga opposed their candidature.Raila asked his supporters to only vote for NASA-affiliated parties &mdash; ODM, Ford Kenya, ANC, Chama cha Mashinani and Wiper &mdash; on August 8.In the March 4, 2013, general election, where the party pushed the six-piece voting pattern, independent candidates had a rough time then as well.No independents were elected in Nyanza. Only a handful of candidates who ran on party tickets other than ODM were elected, including Migori Governor Okoth Obado (PDP) and Kisumu West MP Olago Aluoch (Ford Kenya).The candidates will have to work harder on their strategies to beat candidates from ODM, and NASA as a whole.Most of the candidates are running against Raila&rsquo;s close allies for the governor seats.Raila told his supporters voting for NASA parties will bolster his presidency bid when he bags 25 per cent of elected leaders in the 47 counties.NASA co-principal Musalia Mudavadi said those who lost in the primaries should shelve their ambitions and support those who won. He said NASA co-principals shelved their ambitions after the select committee chose Raila as the presidential flagbearer.But this has not been taken lightly by some, who said ODM leaders should focus on the bigger picture and not antagonise the independents. The candidates have, however, remained optimistic and confident they will beat Raila&rsquo;s allies.In Homa Bay, incumbent Governor Cyprian Awiti will face Oyugi Magwanga, who earlier said Awiti was rigged in. In Migori, Obado expects a stiff competition from Ochilo Ayacko.
