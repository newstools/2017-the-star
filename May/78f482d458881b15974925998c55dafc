Presidential candidates yesterday put the IEBC on the spot for introducing tough rules that could lock them out of the August 8 polls.Sixteen presidential candidates, particularly the independents, said the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission&rsquo;s provision demanding nomination by 2,000 non-party members across the country is a ploy to bar them from the race.Section 29 {2} of the Elections Act 2012 requires an independent presidential candidate to collect signatures from supporters not affiliated with any political party in at least 24 counties.Section 29 {1} demands presidential aspirants from a political party to be nominated by 2,000 supporters allied to their party in 24 counties.Independent presidential aspirant Nazlin Omar termed the provision &ldquo;unconstitutional&rdquo; and said she is challenging it in court.Omar, also the President of the Caucus of Independent Candidates in Kenya, said the provision seeks to deny people their democratic right of supporting any aspirant they want by forcing voters to stick with the two largest political outfits, NASA and JP.She also wants the court to push back the August election date on grounds the Wafula Chebukati-led IEBC is not ready to deliver a free, fair and credible general election.&ldquo;I can clearly see IEBC set up to rule out independent candidates in Kenya. The Constitution is very clear that you need 2,000 voters to sign for you in the majority of counties, not independent voters. It is none of our business or the IEBC to verify that they are independent supporters,&rdquo; she said.Omar, the only woman aspirant in the presidential race, asked the commission to use its administrative powers to change rules undermining and attempting to block the independents&rsquo; bid.&ldquo;These are constitutional contraventions. The IEBC is calling for war on the ground. This is a recipe for mayhem. If you [IEBC] are going to block us unconstitutionally then we are going to fight in court,&rdquo; Omar said.&ldquo;The election process has already been rigged by trying to lock us out. There are no credible elections as we speak now unless you put your house in order.&rdquo;Chebukati, however, told off the independent presidential aspirants and maintained that no law has been violated. He admitted that there have been inconsistencies in provisions in the law but the commission has been respecting and adhering to new changes courts have been making through orders.
