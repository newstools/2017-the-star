Thursday morning was a dark day for family, friends, and fans of Ivan Ssemwanga, a Ugandan-South African businessman who succumbed to a heart attack. Before his demise, Ssemwanga, 40, was in a comma for 11 days at the Steve Biko Hospital, Pretoria, South Africa. He was the ex-husband of Zari Hassan, the current wife of bongo star Diamond Platnumz. Word Is exclusively talked to the Salome hitmaker, who revealed that it was a hard time for his family. “Nilisikia vibaya kwa sababu ameacha watoto wake watatu na mimi naamini bado wadogo walikua still wadahitaji malezi ya mama yao mzazi. Uwepo wa baba yao ulikua una nafasi kubwa katika maisha yao. Nimeipokea kwa masikitiko lakini unajua at the endof the day ni Mwenyezi Mungu anayepanga,” Diamond said. Diamond further revealed that he was going to stand up as a father figure to the kids Ivan had left, adding that he was going to do everything to raise them well. “Nilikua naongea jana na mama yao nikamwambia kwenye uhitaji wangu nisisite kuambiwa kwa sababu at the end of the day we are family. Nitajitahidi kadri ya uwezo wangu. They need our support and i’ll make sure i be there for them.” Ivan was Zari Hassan's husband for 12 years, after which the two parted ways over irreconcilable differences. The two were blessed with sons Pinto, Quincy and Raphael Junior. There is an ongoing debate on whether Diamond should attend the funeral set for tomorrow in Uganda, since Zari is still practically married to Ivan. There is also the issue of inheritance, with pundits wondering whether Zari is entitled to run Ivan's massive business empire. We will keep you in the loop as it all unfolds.
