Youths in Kiambu want politicians seeking elective seats to spell out their agenda for the county.Speaking in Kiambu town on Monday, the Kiambu Youths for Change outfit said politicians should address their issues.Led by Kariuki Wa Kiruga, the group said politicians usually make empty promises.&ldquo;The song that politicians sing during campaigns is that once they are elected, they will do this and that, but nothing is done. Now we want them to make a commitment and if they don&rsquo;t, we will give them a red card without waiting for five years for another election,&rdquo; he said.Kariuki said leadership and integrity is paramount as outlined in the Constitution and Kiambu residents have a right to scrutinise the leaders they want to elect.He said leaders make plans without considering the people.Kariuki urged residents to shun selfish leaders.&ldquo;We have the votes and we are looking at the political landscape. Leaders are plotting against each other and we always see them on television holding meetings without the input of mwananchi,&rdquo; he said.
