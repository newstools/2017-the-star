Nyandarua woman representative, Wanjiku Muhia, should accept she lost fairly in the Jubilee Party primaries and move on, candidate Faith Gitau said yesterday. &ldquo;She should concede like I did when she defeated me 2013 and God will bless her wherever she goes,&rdquo; Gitau said. &ldquo;In every contest there is a winner and a loser. If the people of Nyandarua said Faith Wairimu Gitau is their Mama County, she should not force herself on them. It is not possible to work for the people if they don&rsquo;t want you.&rdquo; She spoke at ACK hall, Ol kalou, after she was cleared by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to contest in the August polls. Yesterday morning, Muhia&rsquo;s body guard, Tirus Maina, came to the hall with a letter allegedly for IEBC officials which was meant to stop them from clearing Gitau. The letter is said to have been snatched by Gitau&rsquo;s supporters because they thought it was a court order. Gitau said Muhia needs to understand there is nothing she can do to reverse the situation. Muhia had challenged Gitau&rsquo;s win but was dismissed. Muhia did not respond to the Star for comment.
