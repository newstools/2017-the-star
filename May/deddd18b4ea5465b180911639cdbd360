Narok Governor Samuel Tunai has warned residents against splitting the Rift Valley vote by electing NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga.He said Raila is using Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto to divide the Kalenjin community and ascend to power.&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fall for Raila&rsquo;s tricks by voting for him because he is only interested in being President,&rdquo; Tunai said on Saturday. &ldquo;If you make the mistake of electing him, you are the ones who will suffer most because he will continue with his plans of evicting all the people in the Mau Forest.&rdquo;He was campaigning for Jubilee Imotiok MCA nominee Samuel Kositany in Narok West.Tunai criticised Raila for his role in the Mau Forest evictions when he was Prime Minister in the grand coalition government.He said the biggest casualty was the Kipsigis community.&ldquo;Let us not forget so quickly what he did to the community in 2009. Those are the leaders who cannot be trusted with the country&rsquo;s leadership,&rdquo; Tunai said.He urged residents to ignore Rutto&rsquo;s CCM party, which he said is working round the clock to discredit Deputy President William Ruto in Rift Valley.&ldquo;Raila knows very well that getting votes in North Rift Valley is a bigger task and he has now resorted to the South Rift through CCM, which is less popular and lacks political direction,&rdquo; Tunai said. Support DP Ruto, he urged the community.&ldquo;Your son is going to be a presidential candidate in 2022 and all of us should back him and President [Uhuru] Kenyatta in this poll. After that, we turn our focus on him in the other election,&rdquo; Tunai said.The governor was accompanied by Deputy Governor Evelyn Aruasa and Narok woman representative Soipan Kudate.
