Lari MP Mburu Kahangara has urged residents to analyse aspirants before voting.He said some do not know basic information about the area, and &ldquo;are just promising residents how they work as a team&rdquo;.&ldquo;We have a lot of people appearing during the campaigns and we have never seen them in past activities. They are making friendships with people quickly, but the people don&rsquo;t know them,&rdquo; Kahangara said.He spoke on Wednesday in Kimende town. Kahangara said it is wise to elect well-known leaders. &ldquo;How can we just know a person for two to three months and decide we are voting for them because they talk nicely. We don&rsquo;t even know where they live,&rdquo; he said.
