A class six pupil was defiled repeatedly in a Friday night attack by a gang dressed in police uniform in Khachonge village, Bungoma county.Five other people have been hospitalised in critical condition with serious deep cuts. Among them is a shop keeper who received a deep cut on his head as he resisted gang members.Police have launched a manhunt for the twelve men said to have been armed with a pistol and other crude weapons including pangas, an axe and rungus.The gang broke into homes and shops and stole cash and other valuables, including phones.Residents accused police of failing to respond to the attack in good time.A resident who sought anonymity said insecurity has escalated in the area over the past four months following the release of criminal gang members from prison some time last year."We are appealing to the county commissioner Joshua Chepchieng to have his officers carry out regular patrols especially at night as the election date nears because we feel very unsafe," he said.Police asked those with information on the gang members to share it with them and assured that it would be treated confidentially.
