MCA aspirants in Kiambu county are having a difficult time explaining to voters what running as an independent candidate means.Political analyst Ndung&rsquo;u Waweru said many voters expect the candidates to tell them they are running on the Jubilee Party ticket, as it is led by President Uhuru Kenyatta.Waweru says residents want to be associated with Uhuru and aspirants who lost in the JP primaries and are running as independents are conducting civic education before the August 8 election.&ldquo;It is very challenging when one goes to a place to seek for votes and you start educating them on independent candidates. Some were in JP and [now have to explain] why they are independent,&rdquo; he said.Waweru spoke on Wednesday in Kimende town, Lari constituency.President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s former personal assistant Njuguna Burugu, who will run as an independent, has trained his campaign team on how to conduct a quick civic education lesson when seeking votes.He said people are willing to vote for a leader from any party as long as the leader is available, approachable and understands their plight.Burugu spoke on Wednesday in Kagwe market where he had gone to thank traders for supporting him in last week&rsquo;s JP nominations for Lari MP.He garnered 9,576 votes and lost to businessman Jonah Mburu who had 14,228.
