NASA flag bearer Raila Odinga has claimed that the architects of the Ministry of Health scam are relatives and friends of President Uhuru Kenyatta.This was after the USAID suspended Sh2.1 billion in assistance to the ministry.US Ambassador to Kenya Bob Godec said the steps taken were due to concerns about corruption and weak accounting procedures.Read:USAid suspends funding for health ministry departments"It is common knowledge that the architects are highly placed people in Jubilee government," Raila said in a statement from Israel on Tuesday.He challenged Uhuru to come clean, arrest the architects of graft, arraign them in court and recover the money lost.The NASA leader said this will enable the country to be at peace with the donor community."We challenge Uhuru to stand with the ordinary women, children and poor people living with HIV/Aids for whom PEPFAR and other US programs on health were the only source of hope," he said.However, USAID maintained that health intervention programmes will not be affected by the proposed cuts.He said Uhuru needs to understand that Kenyans are running out of patience adding, "this betrayal of our citizens must come to an end."Raila said Kenya has been a focus country of US President&rsquo;s Malaria Initiative adding that it was unfortunate that the Jubilee administration has responded to the suspension "with the usual hubris and propaganda."Earlier, Health CS Cleopa Mailu said the suspension of the US does not affect them in any way.Mailu said support for the procurement of life-saving essential commodities has not been affected."Consequently, we assure Kenyans that stock-outs or non-availability of medical supplies will not be experienced," the Cabinet Secretary said.More on this: Sh2.1b USAID funding suspension does not affect Health ministry - MailuBut Raila said the ministry should not purport to be speaking for the US Government.Raila further said the Estama Ltd, which was paid to supply 100 container clinics at Sh1 million each, is associated with people close to the President."Only recently, the man who supervised this grand theft, Nicholas Muraguri, was transferred to a more lucrative ministry instead of being sacked and prosecuted," Raila said.Last year, the Health PS who was at the centre of the Sh5 billion &ldquo;Mafya House&rdquo; scandal, was under pressure from State House operatives to quit.The sleaze, also linked to President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s own relatives, turned into a public relations nightmare for the first family and the Jubilee government, just months to the August general election.Read: Uhuru sister, cousin were paid Sh200m Health cash[VIDEO] We got Sh41 million health tender legally - Uhuru cousin
