Elgeyo Marakwet deputy governor Gabriel Lamaon has accused his boss Governor Alex Tolgos of being a hypocrite. This followed their fallout which led to Tolgos picking a new running mate for the August 8 polls. The governor said he dropped Dr Lamaon due to public demand and settled for 28-year-old Wesley Rotich as his deputy. Rotich is an economist and has been serving as the county director of cooperatives. He will be the youngest Deputy Governor if Tolgos wins on August 8.

"He has embarrassed me to the extent that I cannot go the office or to Iten town." "People are asking me why I was dropped in such an unfair manner and I have to respond. This is a political betrayal of the highest order," Lamaon told journalists in Eldoret town. Lamaon says the governor had never got in touch to discuss the changes yet they have worked well for the past five years. "He could even have sent me a text message if he thought it was difficult to face me. Am also wondering where the public met to decide that I should be dropped." The DG had earlier said he is not bitter after he was dropped as Governor Alex Tolgos's running mate. "I
donâ€™t consider the sacking a disappointment. I have worked with
Governor Tolgos well and will continue to support him," he said.

The DG, who was still donning a campaign shirt in support of Governor Tolgos during the press briefing, excused himself to go and remove the shirt. He said the governor was relying on advisers who quite often mislead him. During the JP primaries, Tolgos lost in polling stations close to Lamaon's home. He got 17 votes at Kipsoen and 77 at Chebonet against Keiyo South MP Jackson Kiptanui's 500 and 300 respectively. Sources said Tolgos, a Marakwet, was unhappy that the deputy governor was unable to get him votes from the Keiyo community. Tolgos, however, faces a tough challenge after the Keiyo community resolved to back tea estate manager Moses Changwony (independent).
