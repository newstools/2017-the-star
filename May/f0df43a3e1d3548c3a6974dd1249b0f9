A group of professionals from the three counties of Ukambani has said it will ensure President Uhuru Kenyatta gets 350,000 votes from the region.The counties are Makueni, Machakos and Kitui.WONI Initiative chairman Musili Wambua on Wednesday said in 2013, Jubilee only garnered 89,064 votes from the region. The group claims it has 3,000 members.Wambua claimed among the key figures in the team are Health CS Cleopa Mailu, Deputy Chief of Staff Nzioka Waita, PSs Monica Juma (Foreign Affairs), Mutua Kilaka (Treasury) and Victor Kyalo (ICT). It also has chairmen and members of parastatal boards, together with senior government appointees from Ukambani.Wambua, a former partner of Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka in the defunct Musyoka and Wambua Company Advocates, disputed media reports that Uhuru had scheduled a meeting with them. He said the report is part of propaganda to discredit the lobby group.&ldquo;The media reports shocked us. There is no such meeting. None of us is aware. We don&rsquo;t know where the date came from. We only meet when it is necessary and after consultations,&rdquo; Wambua told the Star in Nairobi.Wambua, who is also the chancellor of Embu University, said residents have appreciated four mega projects in the region. They are the Konza Technocity, the Thwake Dam, the Kitui-Kibwezi road and the Grand High Falls Dam, which is in the tendering stage.The team has analysed the politics of the three counties to map out where the numbers will come from. Each member is expected to convince at least 50 people to support the reelection of Uhuru in August.&ldquo;We have facts the government has done a lot in Ukambani, including construction of roads, as well as youth and women empowerment programmes,&rdquo; Wambua said.
