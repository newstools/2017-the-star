Parents in Kerio Valley have been urged to take their children to school as an uneasy calm returns to the volatile region ahead of schools opening on Tuesday.Learning was disrupted in some schools in first term, following frequent banditry attacks.Elgeyo Marakwet county police commander Tom Odera yesterday said calm has been restored, following the deployment of more police officers and the Kenya Defence Forces-led disarmament operation in Baringo county.&ldquo;Parents should not fear to take their children to school,&rdquo; he said. Odera said there has been peace in the area for nine days.&ldquo;Politicians conducted their nominations in a peaceful manner and we thank them for that. We are asking the youth to stop engaging in cattle rustling and instead engage in meaningful economic activities,&rdquo; he said.Two people were shot dead in Mokoro near Tot trading centre on April 21, bringing the death toll in the skirmishes to 77 in the last six months.Learning in Chesetan, Kombases, Ratia and Murkutwo primary schools was disrupted as bandits intensified attacks between January and March.Queen of Peace, Liter and St Mary&rsquo;s secondary schools were also affected by the attacks.Marakwet Knut secretary general John Cheberi asked security agencies to be vigilant.&ldquo;We are asking security agencies to be alert to ensure learning resumes in all schools in Kerio Valley,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Parents and teachers are ready for the term. Locals are still living in fear.&rdquo;Cheberi urged the state to extend the school feeding programme to all schools in the Kerio Valley, as residents have not produced food since March 2016, when clashes between the Pokot and Marakwet communities broke out.In January, at least 600 teachers in 40 schools in the Kerio Valley declined to resume duties, following the 2016 attacks in the area.Teachers in Marakwet said they will not risk their lives and called for security to be restored before they resume duty.&ldquo;How will teachers travel to schools when criminals are targetting travellers in the entire area? Any teacher who will go to school will be doing so at their own risk,&rdquo; Cheberi said on January 2.He told journalists in Kapsowar, Marakwet West, that the frequent attacks have made the area uninhabitable for teachers and pupils.&ldquo;We urge parents not to send their children to school since teachers will not be available until calm is restored,&rdquo; Cheberi said.
