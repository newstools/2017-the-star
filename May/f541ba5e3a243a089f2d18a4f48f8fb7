North Mugirango MP Charles Mong&rsquo;are&rsquo;s daughter and her boyfriend have accused the politician of colluding with police to use bogus terror-related charges to break them up.Erisiana Sabiri Mong&rsquo;are caused a stir at the Milimani law courts on Friday after she claimed her father opposed her relationship with Ahmed Salim Lali, because he is Muslim.Sabiri, 22, and Salim, 24, were charged before magistrate Martha Mutuku. They are accused of engaging in terrorism activities.The two were arrested on Thursday. They were not required to take a plea as investigations are continuing.Investigators from the Anti-Terrorism Police Unit wanted to hold the couple for five more days.The two young adults objected.&ldquo;This young couple are in love and the investigating officer has concealed relevant facts, only claiming he has an intelligence report. But there is no evidence to that effect,&rdquo; the couple&rsquo;s lawyer Wilson Hassan Nadwa said.Mong&rsquo;are is running for reelection on an ODM ticket.&ldquo;The father of the girl is a politician and he is just using the ATPU to instil discipline into her and the potential son-in-law.
