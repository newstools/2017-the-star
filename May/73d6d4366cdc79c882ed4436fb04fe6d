Jubilee aspirants who won in the primaries will be issued with foolproof certificates from today.Party Secretary General Raphael Tuju on Friday said the President and Deputy President are the only ones with certificates.Tuju apologised to the aspirants for the delay, saying the party knew if they were issued peacemeal, &ldquo;it was going to be an arena for a lot of problems and fake certificates would by now be circulating, creating secondary market for certificates&rdquo;.&ldquo;Unfortunately one of the challenges we have in our country is that we have very creative people that would have created that certificate,&rdquo; he said at the Jubilee Party headquarters during a press briefing.The certificates have serial numbers that are unique to the owner with names printed on the certificates. &ldquo;It is not hand written. It is a machine-generated certificate to reduce chances of fraud,&rdquo; Tuju said.Each certificate has the ID card number of the person to whom it is issued.He said the list to be submitted to the IEBC has the unique serial number. This will cut off fraudsters and reduce confusion when aspirants appear before the polls agency.Tuju said a lot of resources were invested to make sure all went well. The party thought the certificates would be ready by Tuesday but close to 1,900 certificates were yet to be worked on.&ldquo;MCAs alone are 1,450 and then senators, governors and woman representatives. When all are added, it is quite a lot. All these numbers had to be verified with signatures,&rdquo; Tuju said. Last month, Jubilee Party warned it will disqualify aspirants who engage in violence during the primaries.Tuju said this will ensure easier management of the nominations.
