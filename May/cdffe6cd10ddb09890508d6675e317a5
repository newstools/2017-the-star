The Embu county assembly has slashed Sh158.7 million from recurrent and development budget in its supplementary budget and reallocated it for the Sh335 million unbuilt assembly offices and rent, among others. In its 2016-17 fiscal year Sh6.7 billion supplementary budget, a provision for rent for the governor’s home is Sh7.5 million a year, which includes Sh5 million annual rent and a further Sh2.5 million for maintenance, was factored under the Office of the Governor. This provision has been made because the county government has not provided an official residence for the governor. In the Education portfolio, the school milk programme was allocated Sh23.8 million. It will cater for the project which involves providing milk to children in Early Childhood Development Education centres for three days a week. It was launched by the governor a month ago. The proposed reductions in the supplementary budget included Sh55 million slashed from the tarmacking of Embu- Kibugu road and Sh5.5 million initially meant for the acquisition of land for the GwaCema-Kithiga road. A further Sh5 million was reduced from the construction of the county’s child protection and rescue unit phase two. Some Sh20 million set aside for the establishment of the County Integrated Monitoring and Evaluation System was also axed. In the county assembly, there were reallocations of Sh18.3 million for recurrent expenditure and Sh70 million from development expenditure as well as Sh335 million meant for the county assembly office complex. This left the legislature with an allocation of Sh504 million. The reallocation of the funds by the county executive was done pursuant to the Public Finance Management, Act, 2012 and the Public Finance Management (County Government) Regulations, 2015. The assembly approved Sh4.16 billion, representing 61.91 per cent of the total budget, to fund the recurrent expenditure. It comprised Sh2.6 billion salaries and allowances and Sh1.55 billion for operations and maintenance. Development was allocated Sh2.56 billion, representing 38.09 per cent of the total budget. Budget and Appropriations Committee chairman Joseph Mwaniki said The Danish International Development Agency provided Sh6.875 million for loans and grants to health facilities. The Ministry of Agriculture funds from donors worth Sh11.6 million was also factored in the budget.
