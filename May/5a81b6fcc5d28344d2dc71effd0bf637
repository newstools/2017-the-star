The National Transport and Safety Authority is assessing the soundness of construction of PSVs and will insist on better materials and engineering to reduce road carnage.The review started on Monday.It will cover construction of buses with a capacity of 25 or more passengers.Vehicles already operating have seven years before strict review. They will then be required to undergo the review.&ldquo;We do not want to create a crisis,&rdquo; NTSA motor vehicle inspection director Gerald Wangai Wangai said in Nairobi yesterday.The review will also include buses involved in accidents. They must undergo complete structural reconstruction, before being allowed on the roads again.Wangai said the review is required because poor vehicle body work has led to tragic accidents.He cited the 2013 Ntulele accident that claimed 41 lives and the Kambuu bus tragedy in April in which 27 people died.&ldquo;A strong body can minimise fatalities during an accident by 70 per cent. We established some vehicles operate with poor designs, poor quality steel and welding,&rdquo; Wangai said.Review standards will include an engineer&rsquo;s approval before construction or reconstruction can begin.New vehicles will also be required to have continuous pillars attached to the chassis of the vehicle. Review will cover the type of window panes used and their effect after an accident, anchorage of the seat belts and their types.&ldquo;This review will help those involved in construction of the PSVs to be held accountable in case of an accident. Previously, the driver of the vehicle carried the whole blame, but there is more to it than that,&rdquo; Wangai said.The review will be done in partnership between the Kenya Bureau of Standards and NTSA.However, vehicles that are already in operation and have not met the required standards of review will be allowed to operate for seven more years.Currently, the NTSA has approved 13 vehicle body manufacturers, who have the capacity to carry out the review from the 31, who had sought approval.
