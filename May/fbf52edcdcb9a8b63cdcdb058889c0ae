Health services in Nyeri were disrupted on Wednesday after nurses downed tools over promotions and shortage of staff. They issued a strike notice on April 6 demanding that the county hires more nurses and promote those at various facilities.Beatrice Nduati, Knun Nyeri branch secretary, said the county government has ignored numerous appeals on the matter. She said none of their members have been promoted for the last four years adding that they are not ready to resume work. Nduati said the failure to hire an additional 400 nurses has forced them to overwork hence they end up being demoralised. Patients seeking services at Nyeri county referral hospital were referred to private hospitals. Others were turned away.The union officials later stormed Governor Samuel Wamathai's office demanding to be addressed. The county boss was away.The strike comes barely two months after doctors called off a 100-day strike which crippled services at public health facilities.Read: Doctors sign deal ending 100-day strike
