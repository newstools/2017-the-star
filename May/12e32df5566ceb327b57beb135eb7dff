I used to wake up early for practice and I succeeded in all other examinations but I failed at the medical stage," she said."It is only one lady who was picked among hundreds who turned up. I will not venture into other businesses until I use an AK47rifle."Twenty-two men and 12 others in Tigania West and Tigania Central qualified.A bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Criminology and Security graduate Isaiah Murithi was happy to join the service after several attempts in the past. The Chuka University graduate said he was grateful to God for joining his dream job.Tigania West Police officer in charge of the exercise Corporal Mulu Kotobo said the turn up was large and peaceful.Many were turned away due to strict regulations on height, lacking letter of good conduct, medical, mental and physical fitness.Kotobo added different observers including Anti-corruption agents were present during the exercise.However, there were claims in Tigania Central that recruits fronted by high-ranking officers and prominent politicians were considered than the rest.Read: Human rights lobby dissatisfied with police recruitment, says rules violatedAlso read: Police recruitment: Samburu Central women cry foul as only one slot availableThe Kenya National Commission on Human Rights on Friday expressed dissatisfaction in the recruitment process.
