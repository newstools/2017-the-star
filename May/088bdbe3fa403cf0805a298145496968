Lamu residents demonstrated outside Malindi law courts on Tuesday, demanding the withdrawal of a case on land set aside for a wind energy project.They asked Cordison International to withdraw its case for Belgium-based Kenwind Holdings to start work on its Sh21 billion project at Baharini in Mpeketoni, Lamu.Cordison is reportedly owned by three Kenyan brothers. Two who live in the US moved to court to compel NLC and its chairman Muhammad Swazuri to issue lease documents as directed by the county.Kenwind, a subsidiary of Belgian renewable energy giant Elicio NV, plans to set up a wind power plant that will produce a 90MW on 3,200 acres of land.Cordison intends to work on the project at a cost of Sh23 billion. It obtained orders from the Land and Environment court restraining Kenwind from implementing project until the judicial review matter is determined.The American company is challenging the process of acquisition of 11,000 acres of land and part of the project development plan.Read: Court adjourns Lamu Wind energy case to May 29The protesters noted the case has frustrated the investor and that time and money are being wasted.Linus Gachoki, a resident of Baharini in Mpeketoni, said they didn't understand why the matter was in court as the county government set a location for the project.Gachoki added that the case has resulted in a lot of suffering. Ibrahim Shahib, Lamu Interface Initiative chairman, said they support the project by Kenwind as it will benefit the people.Kenwind representative Susan Nandwa said there have been many challenges.But she noted: &ldquo;We are not afraid because we followed legal procedures in obtaining the land."Nandwa said the company got approvals from the Lamu Energy department and negotiated the land acquisition with the NLC.She said the Lamu government must offer clarity on having the project at Baharini.The matter was earlier brought before Lands court justice Justice James Olola who was to hear parties' preliminary objections.Olola will make a ruling on the objections on July 7.
