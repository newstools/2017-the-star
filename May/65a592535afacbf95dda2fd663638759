The first two days of voter verification have been slow as Kenyans wait to do their customary last-minute dash.In Westlands Primary School, the agents said they had verified less than 20 people by yesterday afternoon. Two desks are for voters whose details are correct, and there is a third desk for voters with registration problems.Similar cases were witnessed in Moi Avenue, City and Highridge primary schools.&ldquo;The day has been slow. Not much activity has been witnessed despite the process being very simple and taking very little time,&rdquo; one of the agents at the Westlands Primary School said yesterday.The exercise will run until June 9. It aims to enable registered voters confirm whether or not they will be allowed to vote.The 30-day exercise will involve verifying the more than 19 million Kenyans who have been registered to vote in this year&rsquo;s General Election.&ldquo;We hope the exercise will weed out ghost voters and those who were registered irregularly,&rdquo; IEBC chairperson Wafula Chebukati said on Wednesday.The electoral agency on April recruited 41,940 temporary staff to carry out its voter verification exercise.The jobs will include 290 constituency ICT clerks, 1,450 register of voters verification assistants and 40,200 voter verification clerks.
