NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga and national campaign chairman Musalia Mudavadi have told candidates to prepare for stiff competition within the alliance in the struggle for numbers in the national and county assemblies. The two held separate meetings in Kakamega town on Saturday to encourage their candidates to go all out to ensure they win the majority of seats. Mudavadi met ANC candidates at Golf Hotel in Kakamega, as Raila met ODM hopefuls at Bishop Nicholas Stam Pastoral Centre on the outskirts of the town. They both told their candidates to prepare for stiff competition. The two then headed to Mumias subcounty, where they attended the funeral of former Mumias MP Francis Obongita, before they addressed a public rally at Bomani grounds. The declarations by Raila and Mudavadi bring an end to a narrative by ANC and Ford Kenya aspirants that ODM should leave seats in Western to either of the two parties because Mudavadi and Wetang’ula “sacrificed their presidential ambitions for Raila”. Raila told his candidates they should be proud to fly the flag of a major party in the coalition and should take advantage of the opportunity. He said, “We are in a competition and we want to expand our territory.”
