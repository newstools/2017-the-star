A Sh 39 million debt by the Kakamega government to the Kenya Medical Supplies Agency has led to an acute shortage of medicine in hospitals in the county.Patients visiting hospitals and health facilities in the region are being asked to buy essential medicine from local chemists after prescription.Heads of health facilities told the Star yesterday they last received medical supplies from Kemsa in November last year.County health executive Penina Mukabane said her office is working with the treasury to settle the debt and resume medical and non-medical supplies to hospitals.She said the November supplies were to last until February.&ldquo;We have already placed a Sh78m order for drugs and non-pharmaceuticals to go to all hospitals. Kemsa has promised to deliver the kit by end of next week,&rdquo; Mukabane said.Interviews by heads of facilities indicated they lack antimalarial, antibiotic and pain killers, collectively known as tracer drugs.&ldquo;We are supposed to receive medicine and other non-pharmaceuticals every three months, but the kits keep delaying.When this happens we ask patients to buy drugs on their own,&rdquo; a health official said.The officials said cases of malaria are on the rise, but the hospitals do not have enough medicine. Sources said Kemsa is reluctant to service orders by the county governments because they default in paying for the supplies made in time. &ldquo;It is unfortunate that the situation is becoming worse despite the fact that health is a fully devolved function. You go hospital and you are asked to buy drugs including Panadol from chemists,&rdquo; said a patient at the Kakamega County General Hospital.The hospital still serves as the referral facility for the four counties of Vihiga, Bungoma and Busia in Western region. The Sh6 billion Kakamega County Teaching and Referral Hospital is under construction.
