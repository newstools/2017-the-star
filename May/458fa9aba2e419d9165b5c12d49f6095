Jubilee&rsquo;s Kiambu governor nominee Ferdinand Waititu and Thika MP Alice Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a have been sued by two businessmen for what they call malicious damage to property and trespass on private land.The two landowners &mdash; Duncan Macharia and Michael Njiiri &mdash; say the legislators constructed a public road on their land in Thika without their consent.A temporary restraining order was issued on Wednesday last week, stopping the Waititu and Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a from interfering in the two pieces of land.They says Waititu and Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a invaded the land early this month and constructed an exit road at Chania Bridge near the Blue Post Hotel to end traffic congestion in Thika town.Court documents say that on May 9, the two &ldquo;dishonestly, unlawfully and capriciously entered the plaintiff&rsquo;s land parcels Thika Municipality Block 10/718 and Thika Municipality Block 10/719 and constructed a road&rdquo;.They say Waititu and Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a, through their employees and agents, began to excavate the ground, uproot trees, destroy crops and lay hard core on the plots. Attorney General Githu Muigai and Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet have been named as respondents in the suit.Judge Nyambura Gacheru of the Environment and Lands Court in Thika said, &ldquo;A temporary injunction is issued restraining the defendants, whether by themselves, their agents, employees, assignee acting with their consent, direction or authority, from entering, excavating, destroying vegetation, distributing boundaries, introducing hard core or directing traffic to the parcels.&rdquo;Macharia, in suit documents seen by the Star, says he is the legitimate owner of the land under a leasehold tenure of 99 years that began in 1952.He said he was denied possession of his property when the lawmakers constructed the road.Macharia added, &ldquo;The act was a breach of private property rights and is considered landgrabbing, invasion to property or trespass.&rdquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve suffered emotional and physiological stress as I&rsquo;ve been viewed as a landgrabber in the eyes of the right thinking members of the public,&rdquo; reads Macharia&rsquo;s affidavit.Taffic police officers from Thika police station have been accused of directing traffic through the new road, now called Baba Yao Mama Tena road.Boinnet and Githu are accused of failing their legal duty to protect private property by allowing agents and others under their authority to support Waititu and Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a&rsquo;s actions.
