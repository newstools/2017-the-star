Siaya Senator James Orengo will lead ODM campaigns in Siaya for three months before the August 8 election. Orengo, a political heavyweight in Nyanza, will be helped by Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga to ensure no independent candidate carries the day. During the just-concluded ODM primaries, Orengo only campaigned for two days and trounced his competitors by a wide gap. Orengo is also geared to ensure there is 100 per cent turnout in Siaya during the polls in favour of Raila. Earlier Orengo had hinted that ODM as a party must capture all seats in the county, from the position of the MCA to the top, by residents embracing six-piece voting pattern. Addressing the press in Siaya town on Sunday, Rasanga said all ODM nominees will be campaigning in unison to dislodge the introduction of independent candidates.
