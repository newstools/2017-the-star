CIC Insurance has set sights on more deals in saccos to support growth, group managing director Tom Gitogo said yesterday. &ldquo;We are alive to the fact that about 20 million Kenyans depend on the cooperative movement directly or indirectly, opening up huge possibilities for the reach and depth of addressing their insurance needs,&rdquo; Gitogo told the firm&rsquo;s shareholders in Nairobi. He said the leading composite insurer was investing in training of Saccos on leadership and governance. &ldquo;It is very encouraging that the youth are slowly joining and forming their own cooperatives which will potentially be a much bigger market for financial institutions such as ourselves,&rdquo; Gitogo added. The cooperative movement is estimated to account for about 43 per cent of the gross domestic product.
