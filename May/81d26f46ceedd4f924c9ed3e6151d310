Nominated Senator Paul Njoroge has claimed DP William Ruto is systematically locking out Central and Rift Valley politicians perceived to be opposed to his 2022 presidential bid.Njoroge, who represents the disabled in the Senate, lashed out at Ruto for "high-handedness against those blocking his way to becoming the next President."In a hard-hitting statement to journalists on Thursday, the Kanu Nakuru Senator aspirant told the DP to know that Central is rethinking its decision in supporting his ambitions.The 2022 politics reared its head in June last year when some Mt Kenya leaders said Ruto was not assured of their support in the Uhuru succession bid.This was sparked by Kiambu Governor William Kabogo, who before apologising over the remarks, was bashed by leaders from the region.MPs Maina Kamanda of Starehe, Irungu Kangata of Kiharu, Benson Mutula of Makadara, and John Kiragu of Limuru termed the governor's statement as "personal".Read: Kabogo 'not authorised' to speak for Central Kenya on Ruto's 2022 bid, MPs sayBut on Thursday, Njoroge reignited the debate saying Ruto has resorted to using government agencies to antagonise those opposed to his style of leadership."We saw that senior politicians from Central and Rift Valley who are opposed to Ruto were rigged out during the just concluded Jubilee primaries."He said the list published by a group of NGOs on blacklisting leaders with integrity issues was part of the scheme.The Senator's name appeared on the list but he termed the move as one way of locking out some leaders from taking part in the general election."We have seen that people like former Devolution CS Ann Waiguru who has openly differed with Ruto are on the list. This is a well-planned move to lock them out," he said.The legislator said he wonders why Ruto's office, despite being mentioned in various scandals, was not in the integrity list."Ruto should know there other credible leaders such as Gideon Moi will be seeking the post of president. He should stop his arm-twisting tactics," he said.Njoroge said that it was still too early to start 2022 campaigns. He warned Jubilee and other affiliate parties to concentrate on this year's general elections or lose to NASA.More on this: Joho, Waiguru among 20 politicians NGO wants blacklisted from poll over integrityThe Senator revisited the attack on his petrol station in February adding that this was also well planned to kick him out of business and politics."Polycarp Igathe who led the attack has now been awarded by Ruto as Mike Sonko's running mate at the expense of senior leaders in Nairobi county," he said.He called for mature and peaceful campaigns.[VIDEO] Gun drama as Senator Njoroge shoots at workers seizing his fuel station
