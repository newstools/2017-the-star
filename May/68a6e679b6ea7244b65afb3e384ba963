Candidates for the nine East African Legislative Assembly slots have stepped up their campaigns ahead of Thursday&rsquo;s polls.The House is expected to vote via a secret ballot in a high stakes election, following controversies surrounding some of the picks.According to an earlier schedule, MPs were supposed to vote today, but the elections were called off after the House approved a motion to suspend sittings to attend the IEBC pre-nomination meeting.Some of the nominees seeking the coveted seats have been holding meetings with MPs across the political divide as they intensify campaigns.Kennedy Kalonzo, NASA running mate Kalonzo Musyoka&rsquo;s son, yesterday met some MPs at a Nairobi hotel. He was nominated by Wiper in a move that sparked outrage from some Jubilee MPs, who accused the former Vice President of nepotism.Immediate former Clerk of the National Assembly Justin Bundi was yesterday in Parliament where he met several MPs in his bid to represent the country at the regional Parliament.
