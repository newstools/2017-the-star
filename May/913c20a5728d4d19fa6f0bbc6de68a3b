Meru Governor Peter Munya has said he has what it takes to beat DP William Ruto in the 2022 presidency race.&ldquo;Those criticising my bid should keep off. I have what it takes to beat Ruto. What does he have that I don&rsquo;t? He is not more educated than I am,&rdquo; Munya said.He spoke in Meru town on Thursday where he officiated the opening of a microfinance training at the KPCU coffee mill.On April 16, Meru Senator Kiraitu Murungi told Munya to drop his bid because &ldquo;he will go nowhere.&rdquo; &ldquo;We have seen many people going for that seat, but they have backed down. The likes of Martha Karua, Peter Kenneth, Koigi Wamwere and Paul Muite were all gunning for the presidency, but did they win? They have now opted for the governor seat and others have bowed out of politics, so there is nothing new about Munya&rsquo;s bid. He will be humiliated,&rdquo; he said.But the Meru governor said Kiraitu is wrong to believe he cannot win the presidency. &ldquo;I have not told him to seek the presidency in 2022, I am the one who is going for it. What is his problem? Why does he think Ruto is the only one who is capable?&rdquo; Munya said.He said in 2022 he will be on the ballot because in August he will support President Uhuru Kenyatta. &ldquo;The presidency is not hereditary, so those who are criticising my bid have to realise it is the voters who decide, so I have made no mistake,&rdquo; Munya said.He urged Meru residents to support his bid by reelecting him and other PNU aspirants. Munya said time has come for a leader from the Meru community to ascend to the presidency.He disputed claims that he was removed as the chairman of the Council of Governors, saying his term was over. Kiraitu has said if Munya was serious about his quest, he should have started campaigning for the post this year. &ldquo;Everyone must make their calculations. I can declare to run for President, but that alone does not mean I will win,&rdquo; Kiraitu said.
