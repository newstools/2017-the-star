Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has urged the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission to investigate cartels behind the frequent food shortages in the country.The Maendeleo Chap Chap leader blamed the shortage of maize on politics and unscrupulous traders. He said the shortage has led to high prices of key food commodities.&ldquo;The EACC should point out the individuals making billions of shillings through the food cartels and bring them to book,&rdquo; Mutua said. He added that the cartels are politically connected and are making huge profits at the expense of the suffering citizens.Mutua praised efforts by the government to subsidise the price of maize flour, which saw the cost of a two-kilogramme packet drop to Sh90 starting Wednesday. Prices of the staple food had hit Sh180 for a 2kg packet.Mutua spoke during a series of rallies in Wamunyu, Katangi, Kyua, Ikombe and Matuu towns during a meet-the-people tour in Yatta constituency.He said the national government should put in place mechanisms to boost food production. &ldquo;My government has initiated programmes that help farmers engage in tangible agricultural practices,&rdquo; Mutua said.
