Safaricom said yesterday it will start investing heavily in connecting homes to internet which it has identified as a future revenue growth segment as full-year net profit jumped nearly a third to Sh48.44 billion.The giant telco said it has created a full department to deliver fibre and other value-added products, including smart phone solutions, to household customers.Safaricom relaunched its internet-enabled digital television decoder, the Big Box, on November 22, 2015 after cutting price by half to Sh4,999 from the Sh10,000 it was charging when it launched on May 9, 2015. The price cut had followed suspension of sale of the decoders on August 24.Collymore said more than 53,000 homes have been connected with fibre.&ldquo;We are aggressively taking this to the market which we believe today is under-served,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This is an opportunity that will define our strategic direction in years to come following the pan-African trend that has seen the number of homes reached by fibre double in the past yea.&rdquo;He said the decision was taken after the firm recognised that customers&rsquo; needs for data were changing as the market continues to mature with demand shifting to &ldquo;more sophisticated use&rdquo;.&ldquo;We believe that our purpose is to empower Kenyans to achieve better; we believe that when we come together we can achieve the impossible,&rdquo; Collymore said. &ldquo;We know that we have the right mix of talent and technology to provide transformative innovation.&rdquo;He spoke during the release of the company&rsquo;s full-year financial performance for the period ended March 31.The telco&rsquo;s full-year net profit for the period ending March 31 jumped 27.14 per cent to Sh48.44 billion from Sh38.10 billion.&ldquo;We believe the strong performance was possible due to continuous expansion of our ecosystem in M-Pesa and relentless focus on what is convenient for the customers,&rdquo; chief financial officer Sateesh Kamath said. &ldquo;We have managed to keep our costs well under control and increased the costs where it relates to enhancing the capabilities that we deliver to our customers.&rdquo;Total revenues rose 8.8 per cent to Sh 212.89 billion from Sh195.68 billion in March 2016, the East and Central Africa&rsquo;s most profitable company said.Revenue from mobile data posted the highest growth of 38.5 per cent to Sh29.29 billion from Sh21.15 billion, while M-Pesa recorded 32.7 per cent growth to Sh45.08 billion from Sh41.50 billion.Voice revenues continued to account for the largest share of the revenues, although at a slower growth rate of 2.9 per cent to Sh93.46 billion from Sh90.80 billion.
