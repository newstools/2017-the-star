A recent post by Sean Andrew, a grandson of former President Mwai Kibaki, has left many wondering whether he was referring to Elodie Zone, a popular Kenyan YouTuber.The two lovebirds had a nasty split in 2016, with each accusing the other of a number of things, including drug addiction and abuse and disloyalty. A few months later, Sean was seen getting cozy with a lass who is said to be a student at at USIU.However, he came out to deny reports that he&rsquo;s in a relationship with the model. Sean said Samali is just a friend, adding that he&rsquo;s busy working on himself.Just recently, Elodie left tongues wagging after posting photos of a certain lad on her social media pages. Fans believe that there could be more than meets the eye between them, as she was seen planting a kiss on him in the photo.And now, Sean, presumably out of jealousy, recently posted a message on his Instagram page that has left many wondering whether he wants to get back with the YouTuber."I'll wait for you because I know I deserve you just as much as you deserve me," he wrote.Only time will tell if the two will eventually get back together.
