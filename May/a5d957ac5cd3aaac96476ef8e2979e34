Police have destroyed the meat of 35 donkeys that they found being slaughtered at Ndeiya village, Limuru on Monday night.They arrested two suspects while several others escaped leaving the meat and a van at the scene during the 2am incident.Police said they suspect the meat had been ordered for by different hotels and restaurants in Nairobi.Jane Kaingati, the area assistant county commissioner, said the donkeys were transported to the area in a lorry.She said they found about 30 men armed with knives and axes at the scene leading to the arrest of the two."We had to leave our vehicles and walked for a long distance as they were deep in the forest.""When they spotted the police, the men ran in different directions but we were lucky to arrest two of them," she said.Kaingati said they suspect one of those arrested is the owner of the business.The officer said that after discussions with public health officers in the area, they decided to burn the meat.The administrator urged public health officers in Nairobi to inspect all eateries to ensure residents are not fed with donkey meat without their knowledge."We have ascertained that the meat is not sold here. We need to fight the illegal trade by destroying the market cycle as well," she said."These butchers change tact all the time. They work so hard to ensure the meat is sold. It is important that public health officials deal with them."Public health officers in Nairobi and its environs are blamed for allowing uninspected meat in butcheries, restaurants and boarding schools.Vets argue that donkey meat is safe as long as it is inspected and certified as fit for consumption.Read: Donkey meat in Nairobi blamed on lax health officersAlso read: Butchers protest as donkey meat ruins trade
