National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale has asked Jubilee-friendly parties and independent candidates not to dictate terms of association with the ruling coalition.Duale spoke to the Star on the phone yesterday. He rubbished a team of independent candidates, led by Kiambu Governor William Kabogo, on calls to come up with a formula to share seats ahead of the August polls.He said those willing to support President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto should do so without giving conditions.Duale said he is confident that Jubilee Party will win the majority of seats in the National Assembly, governor, senator and ward races.He further warned NASA leaders on threats of boycotting the General Election. Duale warned NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga and running mate Kalonzo Musyoka that the polls will go on as scheduled.Duale castigated the opposition for continued unwarranted demands on the government, warning that they could lead to political unrest.&ldquo;They started with demands for removal of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission chairman Isaack Hassan, which we yielded to, but this time round we will stop at nothing. The elections will be conducted in August whether they like it or not,&rdquo; he said.The opposition led by Raila had early this month called on the announcement of presidential results at polling stations and not by the IEBC chairman as has been the practice. Raila warned the opposition will not take part in a rigged election, claiming results are usually altered by the IEBC chair when doing the final tally. Duale said the Constitution is clear on the announcement of the presidential results by the chair of the commission and not at the polling stations.
