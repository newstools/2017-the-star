Teacher Jackson Muvevi was thrilled to attend the Green Initiative Awards ceremony for students from St Martin Kaewa Secondary School in Machakos county. In fact, he decided to borrow a green leaf and implement the tree-planting programme in his own school,Tulimyumbu primary, Masinga constituency in Machakos. Muvevi is not only the Green Initiative Challenge teacher but also a champion. He has made sure teachers, students, parents and the community as a whole adopt the initiative. Regina Mutiswa, 15 has adopted tree planting, saying climate change can only be addressed if everyone plays his or her part. “Our school was surrounded by bushes we had to clear before we could plant trees,” the class eight student said. The bushes were home to snakes that could easily make their way into class. So they had to be careful. Mutiswa said when they learned of the benefits of trees — both environmental and economic — students and the community decided to start planting. School compounds can contain small hardwood and fruit tree forests. Woodlots can be maintained. Timber and fruit can be sold, increasing income for schools. “Water remains a challenge here, but we have to water the trees,” Mutiswa says. The nearest dam is two kilometres away. With 10 acres of land,Tulimyumbu now has trees, including blossoming passion fruits. Trees have many benefits. They help to combat climate change by absorbing excess carbon dioxide and reducing the overall concentration of greenhouses gases (nitrogen oxides, ammonia, sulfur dioxide and ozone). This reduces pollution. They also produce oxygen. Trees provide cooling and conserve energy. Their roots prevent soil erosion. Mutiswa has sister and two brothers and hopes to become a pilot. She says the family and her school want nothing but a win when it comes to planting trees. “All Kenyans need to plant trees,” Mutiswa says. On May 5 this year the KenGen Foundation launched the third phase of the green initiative at Tulimyumbu primary. Present were KenGen officials: Chairman Joshua Choge, Acting MD David Muthike and managing trustee Mike Njeru. Also present were Better Globe forestry managing director Jean-Paul Deprins, Bamburi Cement director of corporate affairs, communications and sustainability Susan Maingi. Others were Machakos county environment minister Joshua Musili. Musili said Kenya is a signatory to various environment treaties and protocols and is home to the UN Environment Programme headquarters in Nairobi. So it has to plant a lot of trees. “Despite the treaties and agreements, no serious effort has been put to tree planting,” he said. Musili said environment management is very costly. He said one million trees have been planted since 2014 but most died in harsh weather and drought. “If they were taken care of, they would have survived,” he said. A country like Sweden has 70 percent of land covered by forest, while Kenya has less than 10 percent. Of course, Kenya is a lot dryer. Machakos county, according to Musili, has only three per cent forest cover, which needs to be increased to 10 per cent. Musili said that he is going to propose a department of biogas so that residents do not cut trees recklessly. The Green Initiative Challenge (GIC) environmental project is implemented by KenGen Foundation, Better Globe Forestry and Bamburi Cement. Ninety-nine schools participate or plan to participate in its environmental activities. More are to join. The participating schools plant multi-purpose and hardy cassia siamea (muveshi) and melia volkensii (mukau) tree seedlings on their 0.5-acre school plots. Mukau is very much like beautiful, highly prized and expensive mahogany, which is poached in Congo. The greening project aims to promote environmental awareness through participation of students and the wider school community. It involves planting, nurturing and developing small woodlots and forests within school compounds for environmental and commercial benefits. Statistics from the UNEP show that deforestation deprived Kenya’s economy of about Sh5.8 billion shillings in 2010. In its second phase, the Green Initiative Challenge aims to plant 460 acres with more than 300,000 tree seedlings and more than 100,000 passion fruit and pawpaw seedlings. The GIC project is designed as a challenge to schools, mainly due to the dry weather conditions in their areas. Prizes are awarded based on the highest survival rate of seedlings and innovation in environmental management. The new schools are in the arid and semi-arid counties of Machakos, Kitui and Embu. They will compete for the top prize, an educational, week-long tour of Mombasa, all expenses paid by Bamburi Cement, at the end of the phase. The addition brings to 300, the total number of schools participating in the project since its launch in 2013. Speaking at the launch, Njeru said, “The third phase is a continuation of the GIC Expansion Project that seeks to enrol more schools and transform their compounds with trees. We are already working with 120 schools and are boasting of small woodlots in there.” Well performing schools also benefit from infrastructural development, water tanks and rainwater-harvesting, and cash awards, among other benefits. This encourages school children and communities to sustainably manage woodlots that provide schools with renewable sources of wood fuel, reducing pressure on surrounding vegetation and forest. “Our commitment to support GIC demonstrates our environmental responsibility as a cement manufacturing firm. The project is in line with our sustainable development program that seeks to conserve the environment, while partnering with stakeholders and communities. GIC, which we are proud to be part of, is one of the possible solutions contributing towards the commitment of achieving 10 percent forest cover that Kenya made during COP 21 [Paris Conference] on climate change,” he said. Once maintained, the trees represent an opportunity for schools to diversify income through sale of timber, fruit and other products. “Successful tree planting is achieved through mastering the fundamentals of patience and long-term vision. When properly initiated in schools, it is an all-round educational activity with a great number of individual and collective benefits for the future,” Deprins of Better Globe forestry said. KenGen chairman Choge said the green challenge complements the government agenda of increasing forest cover. “We have invested over Sh10 million annually,” he said. However, illegal logging and charcoal burning continue to threaten the environment and livelihoods. Choge pledged to give a facelift to some classrooms in Tulimyumbu. He said the fourth phase is set to be launched next year as teachers have shown commitment. GIC aims to green 460 acres with 324,300 tree seedlings in one-half hectare plots for both wood fuel and commercial forestry. The project’s ultimate goal is to raise the awareness and participation of school children in environmental conservation and hep increase forest cover from 7.2 percent to 10 percent minimum recommended by UNEP. The Green Initiative Challenge aims to green schools and communities around the Seven Forks Power Station Scheme. Last year, S. Martin’s Kaewa Secondary School got one-week educational (and fun) tour of Mombasa to learn about conservation. The school was the best among 80 schools that participated in the first phase of Green Initiative Challenge. It had the highest survival rate of seedlings and use of innovation in growing an impressive a small forest and a woodlot in their school compound. The students visited Haller Park and Bamburi Nature Trails in Mombasa, which Bamburi Cement Ltd pioneered and transformed from quarry wasteland to a world renowned nature and environmental park. It is famous for biodiversity in plant and animal species. Deprins said they are working with farmers establish mukau forests. There are a lot of opportunities in arid and semi-arid lands, he said. Deprins said mukau can be compared with mahogany trees that continue to be poached. Mahogany seen in Kenya comes mostly from countries such as Congo and mainly from rain forests. “Poaching will stop because the logistics to get woods from rain forest become s more and more complicated. Secondly, countries that export that kind of wood will not have the incentive any more,” Deprins says. He said once a lot of mukau trees are available, processing will be done for a ready market. Deprins said value addition might happen in the next 13 years, saying mukau timber has been given to different companies and groups to assess. Mukau timber has been given to the Kenya Forestry Research Institute and it compares favourably in appearance, grain and strength with other hardwoods. Mukau only grows to a maximum diameter of 40 to 50 centimetres and thrives in dry areas where it takes 15-20 years to mature. Deprins calls the tree “fantastic” as the wood is high quality and the hardy tree is native to East Africa. About 1,000 farmers are growing mukau. The KenGen Foundation was established by KenGen in 2012 to step up its Corporate Social Investment programs.
