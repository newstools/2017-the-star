Samburu Tourism CEC Peter Leshakwet was arrested on Thursday by EACC officers following corruption allegations. Leshakwet was arrested in Maralal town on grounds he abused his office by contracting a company to run Maralal Safari lodge. He was under investigations following the tender awarded to Africanity company. It is alleged that the official flouted the procurement laws as the contract was not subjected to a pre-qualification process. Samburu county police commander Alfred Agengo told journalists in his office that EACC recommended the CEC's arrest. The county minister will be taken to court on Friday. Ignatius Wekesa, EACC manager Upper Eastern, urged responsibility among public servants when dealing with resources assigned to them. "I urge all public servants to be very careful when dealing with public resources. Those found contravening the law will be dealt with."
