Kitui Senator David Musila has picked Deputy Governor Peninah Malonza as his running mate for the county's top seat in the August 8 polls. He made the announcement on Wednesday during a closed-door meeting with close confidants at Malonza's home town of Mutumo, Kitui South subcounty. He hopes to unseat incumbent Governor Julius Malombe, who recently dropped Malonza for Kyuso Knut executive secretary Agnes Kambua. Malombe expressed optimism that his new running mate will strengthen the grassroots-oriented campaign, and join "a team that is committed to improving the socioeconomic status and livelihood of the people of Kitui."
