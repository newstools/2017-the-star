After days of uncertainty, the Sports Kenya has finally given a nod for the much anticipated derby pitting hosts AFC Leopards and Got Mahia to be played at the Nyayo stadium this Sunday.Kenya Premier League CEO Jack Oguda in a terse statement yesterday revealed that the clash will be played this weekend after agreement between the league managers and the management of the Nyayo National Stadium&ldquo;Following a successful meeting between the Kenyan Premier League management and the management of the Nyayo Stadium, the facility owners have agreed to exceptionally allow the KPL match between AFC Leopards and Gor Mahia to go on at the venue on Sunday at 3pm,&rdquo; read Oguda&rsquo;s brief.The match had been postponed on Tuesday as KPL said intensive consultations between the KPL Vice-chairman Lt. Col. Erick Oloo, AFC Leopards chairman Dan Mule, Gor Mahia chairman Ambrose Rachier and the FKF President Nick Mwendwa had led to the clash to be called off due to safety and security concerns. Leopards had expressed concerns of not being well-positioned to make adequate security arrangements of hosting the match at the Afraha Stadium in Nakuru It was then unanimously decided that owing to the home team&rsquo;s confirmation of being unable to provide adequate security, no chance can be taken of hosting the match at Afraha, and therefore as a result, the match was been postponed until such a time when the Nyayo National Stadium and/or the Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani will be available.The two powerhouses are neck and neck in the league with Leopards in fourth place, just two points behind second placed Gor.Leopards&rsquo; CEO Ronald Namai confirmed the new development and urged fans to turn out in large numbers to support Ingwe who are having a better season in the league. He said in a statement: &ldquo;We wish to notify members that after successful negotiations involving Kenya Premier League and Sports Kenya, we have managed to secure Nyayo National Stadium for Sunday May 7, 2017. We therefore confirm that the derby match with Gor Mahia will go ahead as planned at the said venue. We encourage members to come out in large numbers to restore and confirm our superiority.&rdquo;Last weekend, Stewart Hall, the Leopards coach raised concerns about the Afraha Stadium stands, saying they could not withhold the number of fans who wanted to watch the most attended game in the country. The two clubs will now shift attention to the match which was on the brink of being postponed.
