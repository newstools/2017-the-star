A fresh boundary dispute between Meru and Tharaka Nithi has erupted after a Meru legislator issued a cheque for an office in Kaboto market, claimed by both counties.Tigania West MP David Karithi on Wednesday issued a cheque for Sh400,000 to upgrade the assistant chief&rsquo;s office.However, Karithi&rsquo;s meeting was disrupted by Tharaka South deputy commissioner John Ayienda.Speaking to the press in Meru on Thursday, Karithi said the administrator intercepted him while he was speaking.&ldquo;He grabbed the mic and I asked who he was. I was told he is Tharaka South deputy commissioner. I asked him what he was coming to do in Tigania West but he said the area is in Tharaka and we should leave immediately,&rdquo; Karithi said.&ldquo;I was very surprised as I always knew the area is in Meru county since the chief and assistant chief is answerable to the deputy county commissioner in Tigania West.&rdquo;He said the venue is just 200 metres from Kiorimba chief&rsquo;s home.Karithi said the administrator was accompanied by two politicians.On Thursday violence broke out in Kaboto after Tharaka Nithi Governor Samuel Ragwa and Senator Kithure Kindiki confronted Meru&rsquo;s Tigania West deputy county commissioner Alfred Makau.Makau had snubbed a meeting in Miomponi shopping centre on the border and gone to Kaboto market.Karithi said the administrator was accompanied by two politicians.Makau&rsquo;s guards shot live bullets and fired tear gas to disperse the crowd after he was hit with a stone. It was thrown by residents who had accompanied the two leaders to Kaboto.Kindiki dared the officers to shoot him dead instead of firing at the people.
