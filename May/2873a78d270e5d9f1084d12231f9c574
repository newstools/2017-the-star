Some presidential candidates could be forced to drop their bids following tough legal requirements by the electoral agency.As part of the clearance requirements, presidential hopefuls are supposed to submit 2,000 signatures from at least half of the counties.This means that every candidate must submit at least 48,000 signatures from 24 counties as part of the tough demands by law.The demand is meant to weed out jokers.Nyamira Senator Kennedy Mong&rsquo;are has already opted out of the presidential race, five months after launching his bid. A community newspaper - Gusii Star - linked to the senator reported on Monday Mong&rsquo;are would instead challenge John Nyagarama for the Nyamira governor seat.It was not clear if the senator had failed to raise the 2,000 signatures from the majority of the counties.Mong&rsquo;are had said he would run for President on the Liberal Party of Kenya ticket.The law demands independents be endorsed by voters who are not affiliated to any political party.Unfortunately, it is not easy for the independent candidates to tell which of their supporters are not members of a party as they have no membership registers held by the Registrar of Political Parties.The Constitution requires a presidential candidate be nominated by &ldquo;not fewer than 2,000 voters from each of a majority of the counties.&rdquo;The Elections Act is more explicit on independent candidates, &ldquo;The persons who nominate an independent presidential candidate shall not be members of any political party.&rdquo;Presidential hopeful Nazlin Umar said the IEBC&rsquo;s requirements meant that each candidate would then need to have the registers of all the parties so they can verify those offering to sign the nomination forms are not members of any of the parties.&ldquo;It is nonsense and the IEBC has no business checking the details of the voters,&rdquo; she said.Muthiora Kariara, another independent candidate, also complained. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be getting very negative reactions on this point,&rdquo; she said. Monday was the deadline for the submission of the list of supporters and their signatures. IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati told the presidential aspirants meeting in Nairobi the commission was working in line with the law.
