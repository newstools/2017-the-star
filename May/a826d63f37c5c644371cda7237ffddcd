Kilifi youths lag behind in repaying Youth Enterprise Development Fund and Uwezo Fund loans, Youth CS Sicily Kariuki has said.They have taken Sh209 million loans, but only repaid 31 per cent of the Uwezo Fund loans and 56 per cent of the Youth Fund loans.&ldquo;This means Kilifi youths are denying those in other counties the opportunity to do business because the funds should revolve to benefit others,&rdquo; Kariuki said on Wednesday.She spoke in Kaloleni and Rabai constituencies, where she officially launched the NYS Youth Empowerment Programme.The programme is meant to transform the lives of the youth and has been launched in 130 constituencies, benefitting 130,000 youths.President Uhuru Kenyatta is the patron of the programme.Kariuki dismissed claims by the opposition that the programme is a cash cow for government officials.&ldquo;The programme is not fake, as we hear some people say,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;It is meant to shield the youth from vices like drug abuse and other criminal activities, through economic and social empowerment.&rdquo;
