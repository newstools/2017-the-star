Insecurity is a major challenge for politicians in the volatile Baringo and Laikipia counties.Last week, the government extended the military operation in the two counties for 30 more days to sanitise and restore 100 percent peace.Rift Valley regional coordinator Wanyama Musiambo banned political campaigns.&ldquo;The areas are still unsafe for free operation to both local and political leaders. The military operation has been extended for 30 more days and immediately after the lapse of the period, the security team, led by the Interior CS, will review the exercise to see the expectations have been fully achieved," he said.This is a blow to politicians given that official campaigns begin on Sunday.&ldquo;The political campaigns will only be allowed after the declaration gazetted by Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery is lifted. We do not want cases where aspirants face hostility or get hurt in the areas where the criminals are still operating," Musiambo said.
