Corporates may be more confident of a peaceful outcome of the August 8 presidential polls than they were in 2013, African Trade Insurance Agency said yesterday. The leading regional political and investment risk underwriter said there were less inquiries on political covers than in 2013. This may be a vote of confidence by the private sector in a more peaceful electoral process, ATI chief executive George Otieno said. The 2013 polls followed the hotly-contested, disputed 2007 that resulted in deadly skirmishes which slowed down economic growth to 1.5 per cent from 7.1 per cent in 2007. &ldquo;Compared to 2013 (election), there were more inquiries coming through but now it is not as much as before. Probably, it could also be because there are some other providers within the market,&rdquo; Otieno said in Nairobi yesterday. &ldquo;But for us, we have not seen as much demand as before, maybe because people feel this coming election will be smoother than before.&rdquo; Meanwhile, ATI said it was in talks with the Central Bank of Kenya over proposed introduction of capital reliefs in the industry. This will see it offer credit guarantees to banks, enabling them to engage in more projects without raising additional capital. &ldquo;The talks are ongoing but unfortunately it has taken quite a bit long and we hope this year we will be able to unlock it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is normal bureaucracy because it involves changing of some parts Acts.&rdquo;
