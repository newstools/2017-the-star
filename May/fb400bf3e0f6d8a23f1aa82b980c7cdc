Migori ODM chair Philip Makabong'o has been replaced with Suna East chair Phesto Ogwada for campaigning for an independent candidate.County organising secretary Joseph Nyambori accused Makabong'o of defying party rules and regulations."We will not allow Makabong'o to be campaigning for non-party aspirants that show lack of respect to the party members and aspirants at this election period," he said on Friday.He also warned other party officials of facing the axe if they continue working with non-party members.&ldquo;This will not only be to Makabong&rsquo;o but to other officials who will be interfering with party regulations. We must remain steadfast to make ODM more vibrant,&rdquo; he said.Last week, Makabong'o led a series of campaigns for Ochillo Ayacko who is running for the Migori governor seat as an independent candidate.He warned NASA presidential flagbearer Raila Odinga of voter apathy for campaigning against the independent candidates.More on this: Six-piece vote push recipe for voter apathy, Raila toldMakabong'o had, in the recent past, threatened to resign if incumbent Governor Okoth Obado won the primaries.Raila asked supporters to only vote in candidates from NASA-affiliate parties in the August 8 polls."I have urged independent candidates to adhere to the wishes of the people but they have insisted on running as independent; let them not deceive you using my name to satisfy their selfish interest,&rdquo; Raila said during a burial in Rarieda.The ODM officials have supported the move stating that it will boost Raila&rsquo;s presidency after the August polls.&ldquo;Raila needs a formidable team of Governors, Senators, MPs and MCAs to defeat Jubilee in the first round. We should therefore not allow the party candidates to lose seats,&rdquo; Nyambori said.Incoming chair Ogwada said he is determined to unite leaders and supporters in Migori to ensure ODM wins more seats on August 8 than in the 2013 general elections.&ldquo;I am ready and will work closely with the branch and sub-branch officials to mobilise our supporters to rally behind Raila to achieve 100 per cent voter turnout,&rdquo; he said.
