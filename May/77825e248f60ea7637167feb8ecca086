Former Public Service PS and Mwingi Central MP hopeful Gideon Mulyungi has urged former LSK chairman Eric Mutua to accept he lost the Wiper primaries and work with him. He spoke in Mwingi on Tuesday. Mulyungi said Mwingi is a Wiper zone and he will not allow incumbent MP Joe Mutambu to retain the seat. Mutambu is running on the JP ticket. Mulyungi said it would be a shame for Jubilee to win in Mwingi, which is Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka&rsquo;s backyard. Eric told the court he is a very strong Wiper member when he sued me. Now that he has lost the elections twice during nominations, I ask him to join me. Let us work together,&rdquo; he said. On April 24, Mulyungi got 11,676 votes against Mutua&rsquo;s 3,587 votes. Mutua filed a petition and garnered 7,023 votes against Mulyungi&rsquo;s 15,833 during the repeat polls.
