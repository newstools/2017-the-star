A South African whose passport is held by Nairobi Hospital over unpaid doctor&rsquo;s fees has sued seeking the release of the document.Brand Floris Johnnes Cornelius says he settled his bill of Sh2.9 million with the hospital and he does not know where the new demand of doctor&rsquo;s fees is coming from.He also says he does not even know the sum of the alleged doctor&rsquo;s fees.He wants the High Court to grant him an order declaring that he be compensated for infringement of his right to dignity.Cornelius fell ill on July 18, 2016, which forced him to seek medical attention at the hospital.The doctors admitted him for surgery. He underwent two operations within 31 days.He was discharged on August 20 to enable him recuperate from home due to escalating medical bill.Before his discharge, he says he was informed his bill was Sh2.9 million.Cornelius raised Sh2.6 million immediately after which he was allowed to go home, leaving a balance of Sh328,000.An agreement was entered between the two parties and Cornelius had to deposit his passport as security.Cornelius told the court that in February he cleared the debt and officially communicated to the hospital about it However, in March when he went to collect his passport, he was denied the document on grounds that he did not clear doctor&rsquo;s fees.He says he demanded that he be given a breakdown of his bill and the doctor&rsquo;s fees.But the hospital never gave him the bill and informed him the amount entered in the agreement was erroneous, Cornelius says.He says the hospital is illegally withholding his passport. He wants it released.He needs the passport to arrange a renewal because it is due to expire on October 30.&ldquo;The passport issued on October 31, 2007, was valid for 10 years, hence due to lapse on October 30, 2017, and I urgently require the same to commence the renewal process, failing which I will no longer be the holder of a valid passport which will put my stay in Kenya at great risk,&rdquo; Cornelius says.
