President Uhuru Kenyatta has bowed to pressure to reduce the cost of living amid a public uproar.Tomorrow, the government will introduce a supplementary budget in Parliament aimed at reducing the cost of basic foodstuffs whose prices have gone up in the recent past.The prices of sugar, milk and unga, for instance, are way too high, especially for low-income earners.The prolonged drought has partially been blamed for the high cost of foodstuffs and the government has an obligation to cushion ordinary citizens.It has a duty to ensure citizens have food on their tables, and the food needs to be affordable and nutritious.The cost of living is often a major issue in a general election year the world over, with the incumbents doing all they can to claim the benefits of every relief and their challengers to push a cost-of-living and hell-on-earth crisis narrative for all its worth.The proposed supplementary budget is a good idea, and all MPs must support it.
