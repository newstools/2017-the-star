Meru Governor Peter Munya has defended himself against claims he is campaigning against Senator Kiraitu Murungi based on his age.Munya reiterated that it is time for political transition in Meru, and Kiraitu should prepare for defeat. He said Kiraitu chose not to run for governor in 2013 because his age could not allow him to perform well.&ldquo;We sat with other Meru leaders and asked him which seat he wanted in the 2013 polls. He told us the Senate seat because, and I quote, &lsquo;My years do not allow me to be governor. I cannot wake up at 6am and go to bed late. I want to be near the warmth of the national government&rsquo;. And in the first three years, he supported me, saying I had performed exceptionally. What changed?&rdquo; Munya said.On May 7 at Githongo, Imenti Central constituency, Kiraitu said he is being discredited by Munya for being old, whereas the governor does not use the same vigour to describe NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga.Kiraitu is seeking to unseat Munya.&ldquo;Munya says Kiraitu is old. Yes I am 65, and the US is led by a 70-year-old Donald Trump. It is the world&rsquo;s most powerful country. Which job can Munya do in his youth that Kiraitu cannot do when he is aged? The work of a governor is not hard. I have three degrees. Can&rsquo;t I deliver? Who are you to say Kiraitu is old?&rdquo; he said.Speaking to Buuri and Imenti North sub-county teachers at Gitoro on Saturday, Munya said due to the agreement reached by elders and leaders before the 2013 General Election on the sharing of political seats, Nyambene region was to retain the Governor seat for 10 years.&ldquo;Former MPs Silas Muriuki (Imenti North), Gitobu Imanyara (Imenti Central) and Kilemi Mwiria (Tigania West) were there and we later called all leaders from Meru and agreed to vote in a governor from Nyambene and a senator from Imenti,&rdquo; Munya said.
