Former Vice President Kalonzo Musyoka suffered a major political blow after Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama - his key ally - dumped him.The move could loosen the Wiper boss&rsquo; grip on his Ukambani bastion, 90 days to the August 8 polls.Kalonzo was on April 27 named the NASA presidential running mate.Muthama, a central pillar of Wiper, said he decided to sever links with the party despite &ldquo;giving my best both in ideas and resources.&rdquo;He said while he was one of the pioneers of Wiper alongside the late Senator Mutula Kilonzo and Kitui Senator David Musila, &ldquo;recent developments and party decisions have gravely disappointed me.&rdquo;&ldquo;A culture of killing democracy has emerged in our party and repression has been promoted. The party leader has been imposing candidates and ensuring that by hook or crook, these people become Wiper candidates,&rdquo; Muthama said in a statement.Musila resigned last month as Wiper chairman and announced he will run for Kitui governor as an independent candidate.He accused Kalonzo of rigging him out in favour of incumbent Julius Malombe. Muthama yesterday lifted the lid on the simmering tension with Kalonzo, accusing him of strangling party democracy.He said Kalonzo&rsquo;s tendency to &ldquo;impose certain candidates&rdquo; on the people of Ukambani has forced him to rethink his position in the party.Muthama tore into Kalonzo, telling him off for issuing a direct ticket to Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana and favouring Wavinya Ndeti as the Wiper governor candidate for Machakos county.He said the two were Johny-come-latelies and Kalonzo went ahead to support them at the expense loyal members members.Muthama cited the loss of Machakos Deputy Governor Bernard Kiala to Ndeti and Kibwana&rsquo;s direct ticket as some of the reasons he opted to leave the party. He said during Saturday&rsquo;s repeat Wiper primaries in Machakos, ballot papers were marked in favour of Ndeti and stuffed into boxes in Nairobi. Muthama said he is contemplating his next move. He said he chose to stand with those who have been &ldquo;bullied and intimidated&rdquo;.
