Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya has accused Senator Boni Khalwale of being behind the Senate push to bar him from the August 8 polls.The Senate Public Accounts Committee on Thursday issued an arrest warrant for Oparanya for snubbing its summons to appear before it and answer audit queries.But the Kakamega county boss said the Senate has no powers to bar any candidate from contesting any elective seat."What you are hearing in the media that I will not be allowed to contest the August election is all but lies. I am going to Nairobi today and that is where police are headquartered. Let them arrest me if they can," he said on Friday.He said he will never appear before the Senate as long as Khalwale is still a member."Khalwale knows I will beat him and he has taken the polling station to the Senate. The Senate does not vote. Let him face me; no institution can stop anyone from contesting."PAC chair Anyang' Nyong'o said after a consultative meeting with officials from the IEBC, EACC and DPP that the committee would also write to state agencies not to clear the governor for reelection.In 2015, Oparanya successfully sought temporary orders sheilding him from being arrested for failing to appear before the same committee to respond to queries raised by the Auditor General Edward Ouko.More on this: Senate can&rsquo;t bar my election &ndash; Oparanya
