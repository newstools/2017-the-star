Kenya Sevens team head coach Innocent Simiyu has cited inadequate preparations and strike as their main undoing in the just ended World Sevens Series.Shujaa finished 12th in the standings with just 63 points after failing to hit their target of at least 10 points per leg in the 10-round circuit.The team arrived in the country to a low-key reception on Monday following another disastrous campaign at the final leg of the 2016-17 season in London, where they picked just five points.The Sevens players went on strike a week before the opening series in Dubai and the team also saw strength and conditioning coach Ian Gibbons resign, developments that Simiyu said were detrimental to their plans for the season.However, he said the past season was basically meant for setting up structures following his appointment just before the series commenced.&ldquo;This year was more of laying a foundation and setting up the structures so that we can have a platform to compete at the World Cup and Commonwealth Games,&rdquo; noted Simiyu.&ldquo;The most important thing ahead of the World Cup is to have a thorough pre-season campaign since, for once, we have a chance to.&rdquo;Director of national squads and elite performance, Ian Mugambi, said the board will review the team&rsquo;s performance this season in the next few weeks to enable them plan ahead for next season.&ldquo;It will be a challenging season ahead. With the Commonwealth Games and World Cup Sevens coming up, we must start our preparations early and get the team in good shape physically,&rdquo; said Mugambi.Meanwhile, World Rugby has announced the dates for the 10-round 2017-18 series. The schedule sees one change from last season as Hamilton takes over from Wellington as the hosts for the New Zealand Sevens, the third round of the series, in February.Next season&rsquo;s schedule will also create room to accommodate the Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, Australia, which takes place in between the Hong Kong and Singapore rounds.The series begins in Dubai on December 1 and 2, followed by Cape Town a week later. After the December break, Sydney will welcome the 16 teams over three days between January 26 and 28, 2018 before teams move to the FMG Stadium Waikato in Hamilton a week later. The fifth and sixth rounds will then take place in Las Vegas between March 2 and 4 and Vancouver (March 10 and 11).Teams participating in the Commonwealth Games in mid-April will travel via the Hong Kong tournament, which takes place between April 6 and 8. The series resume in Singapore on April 28 and 29.With player welfare at the forefront of schedule planners and the importance accorded to rest weeks, the Paris Sevens takes place later than usual, May 26 and 27, before teams travel to London for the season finale at Twickenham Stadium between June 2 and 3. After the series, focus will turn to the United States of America west coast for Rugby World Cup Sevens set for July 20 to July 22 at the iconic AT&amp;T Park, home of the San Francisco Giants baseball team.
