Elgeyo Marakwet Governor Alex Tolgos is embroiled in a row over reports that he will drop his Deputy Gabriel Lamaon to pick a new running mate for the August 8 polls.Close advisors of the governor yesterday said there is intense pressure on him to appoint a new running mate to enable him to get more votes from the Keiyo community.The Keiyo community has resolved to back former tea estate manager Samson Changwony to vie as an independent against Tolgos, who is from the Marakwet community. The Keiyos are the majority in the county and could give Tolgos a run a for his money if they back Changwony. Auditor Benard Chepkulei dropped out of the race for governor before the primaries to back Tolgos. He is pushing to have a deal he signed in which he was allegedly promised the position of Deputy Governor.&ldquo;I backed Tolgos and I still support him for reelection, but other matters on how the county will be run are fully his prerogative,&rdquo; Chepkulei said.Other sources said some of the governor&rsquo;s advisors wants the county director of co-operatives, Wesley Rotich, also known as Lazaro, to be given the Deputy Governor slot because he is believed to have more support from the Keiyo community.Reports show Tolgos&rsquo;s team had settled on Rotich, who will be named soon, but supporters of Lamaon are angry over the plan. Tolgos did not pick calls or answer texts from the Star on the matter. Rotich also declined to comment.Political advisor Thomas Karamai said he had no authority to comment on such matters. Meanwhile, Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen and his rival David Kimaiyo will face a tough challenge in the battle for the Senate seat in Elgeyo Marakwet. A row over the JP primaries has caused the Keiyo community to front its aspirants.
