The leadership of the Nomiya Church Kenya has threatened to excommunicate its members who were in the group of &ldquo;imposters&rdquo; who visited State House on May 2 in the name of the church.Last week, a delegation of people posing as church members visited State House to allegedly support President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s reelection.The delegation (pictured) was led by Eng Caleb Olali, who, according to Archbishop Moses Okech of the Nomiya Church Kenya, does not hold any position in the church. The church has said they were not genuine members and did not represent the interest of the church.Speaking during a church service in Bondo town on Sunday, Assistant Archbishop Rev Jared Gondi said the church will hold a Synod Conference to discuss action against their members who colluded with the imposters without the church&rsquo;s consent.Leaders might excommunicate such members so they can join other churches that allow such misconduct, he said.Gondi said the church would wish to see NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga win the 2017 General Election.He added that the church cannot endorse Uhuru&rsquo;s reelection, when their own son Raila is also in the presidential contest.
