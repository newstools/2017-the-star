Police imposter Joshua Waiganjo has appealed at the High Court in Naivasha against a sentence handed out by a trial magistrate. He said resident magistrate Shadrack Mwinzi erred by convicting him on a count that was amended and removed by the prosecution for lack of evidence. Waiganjo faced charges of wearing a police uniform for senior superintendent in 2012 in Naivasha Township without written authority from the IG. Waiganjo said Mwinzi was biased and failed to adhere to the law. Waiganjo&rsquo;s lawyer, Chomba Kamau, questioned Mwinzi&rsquo;s competence, saying he admitted photographs of Waiganjo as evidence without a testimony of the photographer or crime scene officer. &ldquo;It is not known who was the scene of crime officer who took the photographs because he did not testify before trial court, under Section 78 of evidence Act. It&rsquo;s clear that scene of crime officer must be appointed by the police and later testify before court,&rdquo; Kamau said. Waiganjo was sentenced to five years in jail on October 6, 2015, after he was found guilty by Mwinzi of wearing the police uniform. He was also sentenced to serve six months on three counts. Waiganjo faced two counts of robbery with violence Kamau says Waiganjo has already served the sentences in other counts and he is still serving a term which is inappropriate. He reiterated his client is not an imposter. The lawyer said during his client&rsquo;s arrest, his appointment letter into the police was recovered in his house and he worked as a Police Reservist before it was disbanded. &ldquo;Your lordship, the magistrate occasioned a gross miscarriage of justice when he directed himself to hold that my letter of appointment to police was not formally signed. He rejected as an exhibit during the defence after the prosecution failed to prove that I was not an officer,&rdquo; reads appeal papers.The court will deliver its ruling on the appeal on June 9.
