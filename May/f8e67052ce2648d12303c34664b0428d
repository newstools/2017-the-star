Kenya&rsquo;s fast rising boy band Le Band strongly have often been asked about recruiting new members, but they are strongly opposed to the idea. They told Word Is they believe expansion is one of the reasons most bands break up.They saidL &ldquo;You cant join our band. We are not taking in any new members. This is something we are asked a lot on social media. We&rsquo;ve been building this band for four years and bringing in someone new to the band may mess everything up because we really don&rsquo;t know this person. This is something that most times breaks up a group or band.&rdquo;They added: &ldquo;We were friends even before we started the band, so we know each other pretty well. We can do collabos with other artistes, but having a newbie join us is a no-no.&rdquo;
