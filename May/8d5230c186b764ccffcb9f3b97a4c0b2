Over the last three days, thousands of Mombasa residents have diced with danger while crossing the Likoni Channel that links Mombasa Island to the north of the mainland.Ferries broke down, and one drifted out into the high seas, pushed by strong winds. It had to be towed back by a tugboat.Ferry services are expensive to run and maintain, but not the only option available.A bridge over the Channel would be the best solution to the connectivity problem between the two sides of the town.Ferries are synonymous with corruption in procurement and inefficiency in management. A ramp for passengers to board ferries that was recently launched by President Uhuru Kenyatta collapsed within a month, the result of poor workmanship.A bridge on the other hand is permanent, and can be made high enough to allow cargo ships to access Kilindini Harbour unhindered. Pedestrians can simply walk across.Tourists do not have to miss their flights due to incessant delays.One of the two levels of government needs to build the bridge.
