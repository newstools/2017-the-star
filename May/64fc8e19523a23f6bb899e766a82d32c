Serem from Mosop is considered a formidable opponent. Tirop has also been meeting various groups to prepare the ground for his campaigns.&ldquo;I won the Jubilee primaries against stronger opponents and I&rsquo;m sure people in Nandi will back me in August,&rdquo; Sang told the Star on the phone yesterday.
