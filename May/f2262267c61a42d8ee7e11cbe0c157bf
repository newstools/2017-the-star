President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday increased the minimum wage by 18 per cent.He issued a directive to increase the nontaxable bonuses and overtime to Sh100,000 to cushion low-income earners.Uhuru directed Industrialisation CS Adan Mohamed to urgently convene a meeting with employers &ldquo;to explore measures to cushion them [low-income earners] from costs associated with non-labour factors.&rdquo;Progressive efforts He has over the last two years progressively increased tax brackets and cut tax rates for workers in the low-income bracket.Currently, the minimum taxable income is Sh13,475.&ldquo;I understand you want to have more disposable income to be able to meet your families&rsquo; needs,&rdquo; Uhuru said.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m aware the workers on the lower income bracket are struggling to afford basic necessities. It is not fair that they should be taxed heavily.&rdquo; He was addressing Kenyans during the Labour Day celebrations in Uhuru Park, Nairobi. Uhuru said Kenya has one of the best pools of skilled workers in the world and that is why many of them have found employment overseas.Despite many of them having positive experiences, some have fallen into risky employment where their rights have been abused, he said.Foreign agencies Uhuru said the government has streamlined registration and management of foreign employment agencies.&ldquo;I strongly urge every Kenyan going abroad to use the approved agencies. You should make sure you register at the Kenyan Embassy serving the foreign country you are in,&rdquo; he said.Uhuru said the Jubilee administration has been keen to enable workers to know their rights and has worked closely with the Central Organisation of Trade Unions and the Federation of Kenya Employers to undertake the initiative.&ldquo;Together with Cotu and the FKE, we have developed a mobile labour law application that can be accessed online and on phones,&rdquo; he said.Workplace safety Uhuru said the government has reconstituted the National Council for Occupational Safety and Health to ensure the safety of Kenyans in the workplace is made a priority.The government has also revitalised the National Labour Board and a number of Wage Councils, including the Building and Construction Industry and Private Protective Security Services. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hopeful the Wage Councils will improve working conditions in the respective sectors,&rdquo; Uhuru said.information supportThe government, trade unions and the FKE are building a Kenyan labour market information system.&ldquo;It will be a one-stop shop for finding and advertising work that will also let us respond practically to your needs for training so you can advance in your career,&rdquo; Uhuru said.According to the government, the wage employment grew by 11 per cent in the past full year and more jobs are on the way.&ldquo;My administration&rsquo;s reforms and investments will make us even more attractive to domestic and foreign investors, which will, therefore, produce more jobs,&rdquo; Uhuru said.Regional leadershipKenya is working to build on its regional leadership in technology to open up the job market for the youth.Uhuru cited the Ajira Digital Programme, which introduces young people to online work and provides training and mentorship.&ldquo;This will continue opening up a worldwide employment market and ensure our youth keep building skills that allow them to raise their incomes steadily,&rdquo; he said. The idea is meant to ensure the government attracts more international technology firms to Kenya and encourage startups and growth of local enterprises.&ldquo;World class technology companies are establishing their regional and continental headquarters in Kenya. They are doing this because they know our people are by far the most competitive in the region, and are increasingly world-class in significant numbers,&rdquo; the President said.Konza cityThe government has approved Sh40 billion for the development of the Konza Technopolis, which will create more jobs for Kenyans.&ldquo;Construction is underway. Konza will generate at least 16,000 direct jobs as it is built, and over 200,000 upon completion,&rdquo; Uhuru said.He said the Jubilee administration has followed up the approval of the billions for Konza city, with a grant for the establishment of a post-graduate university &mdash; the Kenya Advanced Institute of Science and Technology.Those present included DP William Ruto, Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli and Governor Evans Kidero.
