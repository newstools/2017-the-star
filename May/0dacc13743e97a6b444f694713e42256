Jubilee leaders from Western have a clear agenda for the Mulembe nation unlike their confused NASA rivals, Sirisia MP John Waluke has said. He said it is no secret that Jubilee will form the next government and continue with its development agenda for Western. Waluke was speaking in Mayuba Stadium on Monday during the launch of an NYS programme for 900 youths from all the four wards in Sirisia. The youths will be paid Sh3,000 per week to clean and rehabilitate roads. “We are not confused like our brothers in NASA who don’t know what they want for the Luhya community and are following ODM leader Raila Odinga blindly,” Waluke said. He said the Jubilee brigade, led by Bungoma Governor Kenneth Lusaka, negotiated with Jubilee and knows what part of the “cow’s meat” they will take to the residents after the election. The JP Bungoma county chairman said they will soon tell residents how they will benefit by voting for Jubilee. “We are not like our Senator [Moses] Wetang’ula, who said he will bring an elephant. Then he said he has brought a rabbit and now he says he is bringing a rat. Who will eat a rat here in Bungoma?” Waluke asked. The legislator urged the youth to do a excellent job and not report to work drunk.
