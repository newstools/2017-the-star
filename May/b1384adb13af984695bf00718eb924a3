As a community, we are proud he will be a Deputy President in the NASA government."He dismissed those rooting for the community to join Jubilee further challenging them to point out the position they could have got in the ruling coalition.Ngilu, the Narc party leader, said there is nothing for the community to gain under the Jubilee government."Jubilee banked on me during the 2013 election for the Ukambani vote only for them to pay me with a donkey's kick."She exuded confidence the NASA coalition will form the next government urging the locals to ensure that they come out in large numbers to vote."The current Jubilee formation is the same KANU we beat in 2002. This time round, we will actually beat them much easier," she said.Kalonzo extended an olive hand to those who lost in the Wiper party primaries to join forces with the winners.He asked the community to prepare for the 2017 elections bearing in mind that they will be given better stakes in 2022."We are doing the 2017 elections with our eyes fixed on 2022. Every Kenyan now is aware that 2022 will be a culmination of the country&rsquo;s unity," Musyoka said.He asked the community not to sympathise with Jubilee adding that it was time for the community to fight for its rightful place in the country&rsquo;s politics.
