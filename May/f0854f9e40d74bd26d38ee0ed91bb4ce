A Kenya Defence Forces soldier based in Kahawa Barracks was on Saturday night bludgeoned to death by thugs at his Kandara home, Murang&rsquo;a.The attackers were arrested after checking into a hospital in Ruiru to seek treatment for injuries sustained while wrestling with Daniel Chege.The gang of six armed with crude weapons is believed to have broken into Chege&rsquo;s house in Kiguoya village at around 1am.A fight then ensued between the thugs and the soldier. His wife, Mary Wambui, said the gang hit Chege&rsquo;s mother, who was in the house, with a blunt object, leaving her unconscious. They then turned to her while Chege was still wrestling with the other thugs.&ldquo;It was raining heavily and the thugs managed to enter our house. I was hit and fell down,&rdquo; said Wambui, who was still in shock.Chege&rsquo;s aunt, who lives in Thika, was called by neighbours asking her to meet them at Thika Level 5 Hospital where she found Chege&rsquo;s mother still unconscious. Wambui was receiving treatment but had regained consciousness.&ldquo;I was told they had been attacked by thugs,&rdquo; she said. The thugs fled after the killing and Kandara police arrived and took Chege&rsquo;s body to General Kago Funeral Home.The injured thugs came to the hospital when Wambui and her mother-in-law were receiving treatment. Wambui raised the alarm when she noticed one had a deep cut in the stomach and was clutching it with a sweater belonging to Chege&rsquo;s mother. The other one had bruises.The doctors said one attacker claimed to have been attacked by thugs in Githurai, while the second indicated he had been involved in a motorcycle accident. Chege&rsquo;s body is now at the Armed Forces Memorial Hospital morgue, Nairobi.
