Peoples Democratic Party leader Omingo Magara yesterday said he refused to wind up his party even after he was offered Sh20 million. Magara said the Kisii community should have its own political party just like other tribes. He said Ford People, which used to be the community&rsquo;s party, no longer exists. Speaking to the Star in Kisii town yesterday, he urged residents of Kisii and Nyamira counties to support PDP, saying it has their interests at heart. Magara (pictured) said the party will boost their bargaining power in the next government. The PDP leader said he will not support Jubilee or NASA, but he will decide which one to work with after August 8 polls. &lsquo;&rsquo;Our community cannot afford to be taken for granted by the two main coalitions. We should ensure we elect leaders on PDP ticket,&rdquo; he said. Magara, who is contesting for the Kisii senate seat, said he was rigged out in 2013 but he is optimistic he will win. He will battle out with former UN-habitat ambassador Sam Ongeri of ODM, former CIC chair Charles Nyachae (Jubilee) and Richard Atemba of KNC.
