We must find a way of healing these wounds to move forward together as one team because the major challenge is ahead of us,&rdquo; Raila said.He wooed them to support the ODM&rsquo;s candidates, and blamed the chaos witnessed during the nominations on Jubilee Party.Raila said JP brought the law banning party-hopping after nominations to prevent its members who lose or are denied tickets after nominations from running to other parties.&ldquo;People have spoken their hearts out with too much bitterness. I have seen &ldquo;Chapia Chapia&rdquo; ranting and all, that is okay,&rdquo; Raila said at Charter Hall.
