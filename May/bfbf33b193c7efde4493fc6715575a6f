David Junior Odera, alias David Wonder, is the newest artiste signed at Bahati's EMB records after the exit of Faham hit maker Weezdom.Word Is caught up with the new gospel kid, who narrated his touching story and how he gets along with the Unikumbushe star."It's a strictly boss-employee relationship. Ni mtu nikiwa studio aingie, nanyamaza kwanza. Ni mtu mmoja akiingia ataniuliza we unaimba aje? Msionange Bahati the smiling kid on cameras, huyo jamaa ni mstrict na ikifika business, he means business. Hachekangi."Talking to this writer, David, who now has a new song called Niambie featuring DK Kwenye Beat, revealed how Mtoto Wa Mama got him out of the wrath of upcountry life."Meeting Bahati was one of the biggest things that ever happened to me in 2016. Before that nilikua naimba but vitu hazikua poa, so ilifika time siwezilipa rent, siwezifanya anything, so niliquit nikaenda ushago. I stayed over there for like seven to eight months."The Naelewa hit maker said he later ventured into the beauty market."Nilianza kufanya job ya beauty kutengeneza kucha na facial and other stuff."His friend would later connect him to Bahati, David's current boss."Alicall Baha, he didn't pick, after texting him, a very long text, na vitu zilikua kwa hiyo text nikasema Baha akiona hizi vitu zote ataniona mimi ni coward. I just had to call Bahati. Bahati took me in. Though sikufanya video for six months, alikua ananimentor."Nevertheless, Word Is can exclusively reveal a message Bahati send to Wonder, who was hoping to scoop a Groove Awards nomination for New Artiste of the Year.Bahati texted him:"Keep Focused. God's blessings on your life are not determined by awards. You are bigger, let God open your eyes to be able to see who you are."David Wonder, who is not up for grabs (he has a girlfriend), is definitely one to watch out for.
