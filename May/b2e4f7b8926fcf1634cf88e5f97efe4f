Deputy President William Ruto will campaign for a six-piece suit voting pattern in the Rift Valley.The move aims to lock out independent candidates, most whom are allies who lost in the JP primaries.The independents support President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s reelection.Speaking during an interview with Citizen TV on Wednesday evening, Ruto said although Jubilee welcomes the independent aspirants, the party will give priority to its own candidates.The DP&rsquo;s allies in the region say they are preparing to popularise the six-piece-suit campaign strategy ahead of the August 8 polls.&ldquo;We will go flat out to ensure that Jubilee gets all seats &mdash; President, governor, senator, MPs, woman reps and MCAs in all counties in this region,&rdquo; said Stephen Sang, Nandi Jubilee governor nominee.Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago says they are backing Jubilee to win all seats.The plan poses a challenge to strong independent aspirants who are Ruto&rsquo;s allies. They include businessman Bundotich Kiprop, known as Buzeki (pictured), who is running against Mandago. &ldquo;I will run as an independent, but I will also campaign for President Kenyatta&rsquo;s reelection. In fact, if there is someone with the capacity to deliver votes for Jubilee in Uasin Gishu, then it&rsquo;s Buzeki,&rdquo; he said.Ainabkoi MP aspirant William Chepkut, his Turbo counterpart Janet Koech and more than 100 other independents seeking parliamentary seats have declared their support for Jubilee. Formidable independents include Anderson Serem in the Nandi governor race and his Elgeyo Marakwet counterpart Moses Changwony.NASA is only targeting presidential votes in the Rift Valley because its affiliate parties have not fielded candidates for other seats. Except for Turkana and Trans Nzoia , NASA affiliates do not have aspirants for governor in Nandi, Elgeyo Marakwet, West Pokot and Baringo, which are considered Jubilee strongholds.&ldquo;But we have a few candidates who the coalition will campaign for,&rdquo; ODM strategist in the region Kipkorir Menjo said. Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto, who is a NASA Pentagon member, says they are targeting at least 1.2 million votes out of more than 4.5 million in the region. &ldquo;NASA is very strong in Rift Valley,&rdquo; Rutto said.
