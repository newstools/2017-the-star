Lamu county commissioner Joseph Kanyiri has cautioned activists against opposing projects being established by the national government. He said activists in Lamu were being used as agents by “enemies of development” to frustrate national government projects in Lamu. Kanyiri on Thursday specifically cited the Save Lamu, Wanaharakati Okoa Lamu, Sauti ya Wanawake wa Lamu and the Lamu Youth Alliance as activist groups. He said they were  being used by cartels to stall development in Lamu by opposing major projects, including the Sh200 billion coal-fired power plant. “People must appreciate what the national government is doing for residents. We also have potential gas and oil mining coming up in Pate, Lamu East. All this is for the benefit of residents,” he said.
