Jubilee Party Lari MP nominee Jonah Mburu (pictured) has urged losers to support him instead of forming alliances to sabotage him.Speaking at Kago Primary School in Lari on Sunday, he said he does not understand why his rivals are fighting him.&ldquo;I joined the race like anyone else, and we started campaigning. People nominated me as their preferred candidate for the JP ticket. In fact, there was no complaint lodged anywhere,&rdquo; Mburu said.He added, &ldquo;It is only you who will participate in the General Election and elect the leader you want. It is better to elect a candidate who has President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s ticket.&rdquo;Mburu told residents Uhuru needs JP-elected MPs to marshal support in Parliament.
