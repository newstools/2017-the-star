FOLLOWING the move to devolve elections management and the resistance by some of the former Regional Elections Coordinators, some are in an apparent rush to spend all the monies in the regions. Nairobi Region has particularly taken the lead on this. The REC has for the last one month been procuring goods that do not in any way facilitate the conduct of elections. The predetermined suppliers are obviously having a field day with provision of such things as TVs, water tanks and shredders. The irony is that the constituencies for which these goods are being procured have other pressing needs. Is this a move to ensure that the new County Elections Manager inherits an empty account?******************* JUST what motivates Amani National Congress leader Musalia Mudavadi? Those keenly watching the former Deputy Prime Minister say the guy's demeanour on the political podium has metamorphosed. It's said Musalia is exhibiting rare confidence, is happier, and brimming with energy. This is in contrast to the Musalia who ran a lonely campaign in 2013, especially after he was duped by Jubilee and branded &ldquo;madimoni&rdquo;. Musalia first displayed the current excitement when he unveiled the NASA lineup. Maybe the guy is just happy to become the country's first Prime Cabinet Secretary with the powerful docket of Internal Security to boot.*******************A senior officer at a parastatal could be in trouble. Reason? An EACC sleuth is on his case. The Investigator is said to be following a lead in one of the corruption cases after the parastatal man bragged to friends that his wedding cost tens of millions. He actually said the money spent could buy several acres in Karen. The wedding was in Karen sometime back. The investigator is among anti-graft detectives who have identified officials in government institutions said to have pocketed kickbacks. The man's luck could be running out and a case may be opened against him from next week. Word has it other officers have already faced interrogation pending prosecution.******************** THEY say a week in politics is a long time. Well, no one seems to understand this at the moment more than nominated MP Johnson Sakaja. Just a few days ago, Sakaja appeared to have had one foot in Parliament, after securing the Jubilee ticket. In fact, Sakaja secured even the support of influential trade unionist Francis Atwoli. Sakaja's then ODM competitor Gabriel Chapia Bukachi was not well known. However, Orange House has played a new card. Now they are fronting assertive lawyer Edwin Sifuna to take on Sakaja. A titanic battle is in the offing. Sifuna is a fighter. He staged a coup against Budalang'i MP Ababu Namwamba at Orange House.******************** THERE is a grand plot to divide the Luhya vote and injure the National Super Alliance in a region they believe is their stronghold. Sources whisper to Corridors that Kenyans may see at least two presidential candidates spring up from nowhere from Western Kenya. This is before the IEBC closes down the nomination process later this month. Those behind the plot believe that Jubilee Party will easily secure the 50-plus one per cent vote to avoid a runoff with multiple candidates from the NASA stronghold. It remains unclear whether NASA has any strategy to counter the plan or they are banking on hopes that the people of Western will reject the spoilers.
