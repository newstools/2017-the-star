The government is set to to carry out a national census of all street families, Special Programmes PS Josephta Mukobe has said. Mukobe said the survey will be done by the end of this month. She said the census exercise will be undertaken in partnership with the Kenya Bureau of Statistics. The census will provide the government with up-to-date information on street families to support planning and decision-making in efforts to have a country free of street families. The lack of clear information on the number of the street families has made it difficult for the government to coordinate. Agape childrenâ€™s ministryis helping carry out the survey in Kisumu, Kitale and Nakuru towns. Speaking during a street children rehabilitation consortium meeting in Kisumu on Thursday, Mukobe said the government is committed to rehabilitating and integrating street families across the country. Poverty, family disintergration, violence at home and terminal illnesses push families to the streets.
