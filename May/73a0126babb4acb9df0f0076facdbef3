Kirinyaga county JP chairman John Mithamo has resigned both as the chairman and a member to run for Ndia MP as an independent candidate, the Star has established.This development comes after the Star learnt that last month Mithamo was summoned to Jubilee Party headquarters to answer queries after aspirants complained that he had favourite candidates in the party nominations that were held two weeks ago.When reached for comment, Mithamo told the Star he will run for Ndia MP. He did not, however, give reasons for ditching JP.Initially, Mithamo had indicated he would run for Ndia MP, but made an about-turn during the election of JP interim officials where he expressed interest in being chairman.According to JP rules officials were not supposed to contest in political polls, which automatically locked out Mithamo from contesting for MP.Mithamo will battle it out with JP nominee for Ndia MP George Kariuki, Maendeleo Chap Chap&rsquo;s John Goko and Christopher Wanjau, who lost the Jubilee Party nominations but is running as an independent candidate.
