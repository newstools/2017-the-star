Nominated MP Oburu Oginga has threatened to commit suicide if Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo is issued with a nomination certificate, Midiwo has said.He said Oburu said the ODM certificate would be issued to him over his dead body.The National Assembly deputy minority leader said Oburu warned ODM leader Raila Odinga, his younger brother, not to intervene in a case in which Midiwo disputed the nomination results. &ldquo;Oburu maintained that plans to hand over the certificate to me will not happen at all,&rdquo; Midiwo told the Star on the phone yesterday.The legislator, who is Oburu and Raila&rsquo;s cousin, said Raila invited him to Nairobi to present his case before the national elections tribunal.More than a week later the tribunal has not communicated, yet Elisha Odhiambo, who was announced the winner, has the certificate.Oburu could not be reached for comment, as his phone went unanswered and he did not respond to SMSs.Midiwo has been cleared by the IEBC to run as an independent candidate. He said he is seeking to reclaim his lost victory, which was handed to Elisha Odhiambo, an ally of Oburu.&ldquo;If I cannot get justice because of Oburu, I&rsquo;ve decided to defend my seat as an independent,&rdquo; he said. Midiwo said he will campaign for Raila&rsquo;s presidency since he bears him no ill-will. Midiwo said that together with Siaya governor aspirant Nicholas Gumbo, they will roll out an aggressive campaign across the county to expose Oburu&rsquo;s underhand deals. Gumbo and Siaya woman representative aspirant Florence Aluodo have announced they will run as independents. Gumbo lost the ODM ticket to incumbent Cornel Rasanga while Aluodo lost to Christine Ombaka.
