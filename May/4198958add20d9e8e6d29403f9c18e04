ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi has said the party has given Kenyans the real alternative to the Jubilee governance mess.He addressed ANC candidates for the August 8 polls at Golf Hotel, Kakamega, yesterday. Mudavadi said ANC followers must be proud that their idea is the one driving the country&rsquo;s politics at the moment.&ldquo;I could still have become selfish and insisted that I must stand as President but I sacrificed my ambition because we realised that Kenyans are suffering,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;I will contribute to the NASA campaigns at the national level because they are important for the profile of NASA as well as ANC. I am still taking this thing personally because we created NASA. I may not be the flagbearer but if NASA wins, my primary objective and the collective objective of ANC in creating it will have been achieved.&rdquo;He said ANC will fight for its space within NASA by ensuring it wins more seats to benefit from other public appointments.&ldquo;I am going to take a personal interest in the performance of ANC. As much as I will be campaigning at the national level, I will take interest in the performance of ANC candidates all over the country,&rdquo; Mudavadi said.The party chief said his party is plotting how to sweep the majority of county seats in the four counties in Western &ndash; Kakamega, Vihiga, Busia and Bungoma. He said the rights of NASA anchor parties are guaranteed under the coalition agreement.Other benefits include nominations to either national or county assemblies.
