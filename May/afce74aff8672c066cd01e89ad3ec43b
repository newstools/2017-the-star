The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission today kicks off a month-long biometric voter verification.Kenyans will be able to confirm the accuracy of their details in the voters&rsquo; register and make corrections.Yesterday, the commission announced details of the verification and announced key timelines ahead of the August 8 vote.IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati said the voter verification will end on June 9.A similar verification will be rolled out from May 15 to May 30 in five countries where Kenyans registered to vote.They are Burundi, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda.During a press briefing at the IEBC headquarters, Chebukati said the commission&rsquo;s staff have been trained to operate the new technology, known as the Kenya Integrated Election Management System.The commission will use 10,000 devices during the exercise.&ldquo;Unlike in 2013 where verification machines were received too close to the polling day, the electoral body is now interacting with technology three months to the polls,&rdquo; Chebukati said.He expressed confidence polls will be transparent. But the electoral agency said the register being verified is the same one being audited by KPMG.&ldquo;The purpose of two parallel processes is to give the commission every opportunity to improve the accuracy of the register,&rdquo; Chebukati said.He promised that prior to certification and gazetting of the final register it will be updated with key findings and recommendations by KPMG.Meanwhile, the deadline for political parties to submit their list of nominees to the IEBC expired yesterday.The electoral agency announced it is mandatory for the 18 presidential candidates to submit a list of 2,000 supporters from a majority of counties.The mandatory requirement is considered the biggest obstacle yet to new candidates who recently announced their bid for State House.All the presidential candidates, including opposition chief Raila Odinga and President Uhuru Kenyatta, are expected to submit their list of supporters to the electoral commission between May 18 and 22.The presidential flagbearers will then be required to submit their nomination papers for clearance to the commission at KICC between May 28 and 29.Parliamentary candidates must submit nomination papers between June 1 and 2.
