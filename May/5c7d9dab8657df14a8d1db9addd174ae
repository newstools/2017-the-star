Some 61 per cent of smokers have recently considered quitting as a result of price increases, a new report has shown.However, 37 per cent did not think price a strong deterrent to smoking, a study by the International Institute for Legislative Affairs last year says.The study &lsquo;Influence of retail price on tobacco smoking habits in Kenya&rsquo; was conducted in Nairobi and Embu counties using purposive sampling method. Some 592 smokers were randomly interviewed.Kenyan smokers, according to the study, spend an average of Sh102.7 per pack of 20 cigarettes sticks. This is lower than what is spent on basic household commodities such as unga, milk, sugar and fuel.The report shows the current retail prices range between Sh100 for lower-end products such as Supermatch, Rooster and Safari to Sh250 for high-end products such as Dunhill.Mild range products such as Sportsman and Rothman retailed at Sh250, SM goes for Sh160 while Embassy goes for Sh200. The report shows that most of the initiation to smoking started in school at 45 per cent followed by the home at 30 per cent.The study says 89 per cent of smokers noted an increase in price changes, while nine per cent indicated the increase was negligible.Two percent observed there was a decrease.International Institute for Legislative Affairs CEO Emma Wanyonyi urged the government to protect the gains made against tobacco use.&ldquo;The current tax structure under the Excise Duty Act 2015 structure applicable to all tobacco products should be protected since it is in line with international best practices and WHO recommendations,&rdquo; she said. Wanyonyi said the two-tier tax system of Sh2,500 per 1,000 sticks of cigarettes with filters and Sh1,800 per 1,000 sticks of plain cigarettes is retrogressive.
