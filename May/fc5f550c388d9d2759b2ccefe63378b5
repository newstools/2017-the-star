Key politicians from Rift Valley have the green light to vie for posts in the August election after being cleared by the electoral commission.Gideon Moi, Kipchumba Murkomen, David Kimaiyo, Prof Margaret Kamar and Susan Kihika are among top regional politicians who have received certificates from the IEBC.Murkomen and Kimaiyo are competing for the Elgeyo Marakwet senatorial seat. Kamar is gunning for the Uasin Gishu seat, while Kihika is eyeing the Nakuru county Senate seat.Those eyeing governorship include billionaire businessman Zedekiah Bundotich, popularly known as Buzeki, and his rival, Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago. They are presenting their paper to the commission today. Yesterday, businesses came to a standstill in Kabarnet town as Baringo Senator Moi landed in a chopper to present his nomination papers before the IEBC. Traders closed their shops and lined roads to receive the Kanu national chairman, vowing to reelect him.Moi successfully presented his nomination papers under tight security at the Kenya School of Government, Kabarnet campus. He was accompanied by, among other Kanu supporters, Baringo county assembly speaker William Kamket, governor aspirant Isaac Chebon and former executive officer for Kanu Baringo branch Hosea Kiplagat.Residents in town were clad in red caps and T-shirts branded with Kanu emblems, a show of love and support for the independence party.The son of former President Daniel Moi will face former Betting Control and Licensing Board director Simon Chelugui (Jubilee Party).He arrived at 10.30am, unlike his opponent Chelugui, who was turned away on Sunday by the IEBC until afternoon for coming in late to present his nomination papers.Chelugui got a low-key reception while presenting his papers at Kabarnet show ground, where only a handful of people turned up.Moi, who is defending his first term seat, later addressed the public at the Kanu branch office grounds.&ldquo;I have accomplished the first examination test with the electoral commission, now I am begging you my good people with all the humility to vote for me in August,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Tako tai boriet...&rsquo;the battle is still ahead&rsquo;, Moi said, adding that it will be the last time he runs for senator before running for President in 2022.&ldquo;Vote for me now and you will not see my Senate posters around forever, we will forge ahead,&rdquo; he said.Last week on Saturday, Moi launched his reelection bid at his birth home in Kabimoi, Eldama-Ravine.He accused Deputy President William Ruto of frequenting Baringo to campaign against him, not spur development. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let DP Ruto &lsquo;castrate&rsquo; your own when other Kalenjin communities like Nandi and Kipsigis preserve theirs,&rdquo; said Moi.The residents vowed to support him, though they complained about him being unaccessible.
