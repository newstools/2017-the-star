The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights now wants politicians involved in past malpractices barred from participating in the election.The commission says this can be achieved through the law, adding all those seeking elective posts should first be vetted.KNCHR vice chairperson George Morara yesterday said the rulings by the High Court on vetting were not clear, adding that the determination by the top court will help in clearing the aspirants.Morara said Chapter Six of the Constitution was clear on who should vie for a political position.He said the Attorney General&rsquo;s working group should consider the ethical standards in the vetting.&ldquo;We are going to the Supreme Court on the 21st of next month. We will be given directions on the way forward, although, in our case, we have sought for the ethical standard to be used,&rdquo; Morara said.He said when ordinary Kenyans apply for jobs, ethical procedures are keenly followed.Morara said the same should be done to politicians and state officers. &ldquo;For a Kenyan to get a job, he must get clearance from the police,&rdquo; he said.
