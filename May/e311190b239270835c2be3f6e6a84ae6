Migori Governor Okoth Obado will lead the NASA campaigns in Migori and Trans Mara regions.Although several other teams will be created, Obado will lead a group of Migori leaders as opposition leader Raila Odinga prepares for his final bid for the presidency.Speaking during his home coming party, Obado said he will focus more on Raila&rsquo;s campaign in the Kuria and Trans Mara region to help Raila achieve his presidential ambitions.According to Obado, this will lighten the burden on Raila, who has been scouring every village for votes.&ldquo;I believe we will achieve a lot with Raila as President because he was the pioneer and the brain behind the Devolution System of Governance, the other team was against it,&rdquo; he said.Obado who won the ODM party nominations earlier this month said he has the mandate to campaign for Raila in his capacity as an ODM candidate.He also cited that he will pick a running mate from the Kuria community as he campaigns to retain his seat on the August 8th poll.&ldquo;My promise to the Kuria people in the 2013 polls was to work with them as my running mate so long as I still look for a political seat in Migori County, they are my Tharaka Nithi,&rdquo; he said.This comes barely days after rumors spread that the ODM party wanted Obado to work with his rival Anne Anyanga as a running mate.Obado disputed claims that he had picked his rival and Nyatike Mp&rsquo;s wife Anne Anyanga as a running mate.&ldquo;How could I pick someone who has been a rival from the last election as my running mate while I have my good friends in Kuria? he asked the jeering crowd.Obado requested the residents to work with the ODM candidates for this will strengthen the Party locally and at the national level.&ldquo;Our main aim now is to work with everyone and strengthen the ODM Party, our flag bearer is Raila Odinga who is also fully behind us,&rdquo; he added.Obado will face former Minister Ochillo Ayacko in the August 8 polls after a bruising campaign for the ODM ticket which the former Energy minister and other aspirants lost.Different ODM primary winners attended the event at Rapogi where a prayer service to the governor was conducted.Read:Governor Okoth Obado decamps from PDP to ODM, Raila promises fair nominationsAlso read: Joho, Obado, Ongoro among 14 summoned by ODM over violence
