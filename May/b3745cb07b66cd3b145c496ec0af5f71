Jubilee leaders have accused NASA principal Raila Odinga and his running mate Kalonzo Musyoka of having interests in the Sh5.4 trillion Mrima Hill minerals and Titanium.Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya, speaking at Tiwi in Kwale, said the only interest of NASA leadership in Kwale is resources, including minerals worth trillions of shillings. Mvurya said the two NASA leaders&rsquo; agenda is being advanced by Kwale Wiper governor aspirant Chirau Mwakwere. He has been accusing Mvurya of signing a mineral licence for Base Titanium to extract minerals. &ldquo;When you see people saying they are in NASA don&rsquo;t celebrate because they want our resources and that is why Raila is interested in Mrima Hill, while Kalonzo signed the mining licence for the Base Titanium, formerly Tiomin Company, in 1997. Mwakwere came to further their interests when he was the Environment minister,&rdquo; Mvurya said. He added that he has never been involved in signing a mineral licence as stated by Mwakwere. Mvurya urged residents in Kwale to support President Uhuru Kenyatta since his administration has implemented development projects.Tourism CS Najib Balala said NASA leaders should be the last to speak about corruption, saying the mining agreement between Base Titanium and the government was signed by Kalonzo.&ldquo;He signed the mineral agreement when he was the Environment minister. Mwakwere did not cancel it when he replaced him. Instead, it was during his time when he issued the Mrima Hill licence to Cortec, which was cancelled,&rdquo; Balala said.
