Former Registrar of the Judiciary Gladys Shollei and former Higher Education minister Margaret Kamar will battle strong independents for Uasin Gishu woman representative and senator, respectively. The battle in the county, home of Deputy President William Ruto, will also be spiced up with the contest between Governor Jackson Mandago and his main rival Bundotich Kiprop, popularly known as Buzeki. Kamar, who narrowly won the JP primaries against journalist Robert Kemei, will again face the media man who will run as an independent. Kamar garnered 73,608 votes against Kemei’s 51,474 votes, but analysts say Kemei has capacity to pull a surprise. They note that an aspirant, also known as  Kemei in the Jubilee primaries, got more than 14,000 votes and may have caused confusion among supporters of the journalist. “I am ready for the second round and I have confidence I will carry the day come August 8,” Kemei said. Kamar is from the Keiyo community, while Kemei is from the Nandi. But to win, they need support from other communities. Thomas Murgor of ODM and Kipsoi Kiyeng of the Labour Party will also run for senator. Keiyo-Nandi battle for slots Shollei, on the other hand, will have a tough battle against Loyce Kibor, the daughter of prominent Uasin Gishu politician and farmer Jackson Kibor. Loyce and another candidate, Rael Lelei, will run as independents. Shollei is a Keiyo, while Loyce and Lelei are Nandi. Shollei defeated 12 aspirants in the Jubilee Party primaries. ANC nominee for woman representative Moira Chepkok is also a strong candidate with a strong campaign team. Other aspirants are Cheruto Josphine (Kanu), Grace Kipkemoi (Maendeleo Chap Chap) and Mary Ann Sheikh Abdikadir of the Thirdway Alliance. Governor aspirant Buzeki is also from the Keiyo community. Analysts predict that Uasin Gishu will witness a major battle between Nandis and Keiyos for the top seats in the county. Most JP aspirants and the independents are close allies of Ruto. The Deputy President will likely be in a difficult position to decide whom to support during campaigns that begin on May 28.
