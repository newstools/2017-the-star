The Senate Public Accounts Committee yesterday declined to enquire into Uasin Gishu and Bomet&rsquo;s 2014-15 audit queries after the governors sent their accounting officers, instead of appearing themselves.Led by vice chairman John Lonyangapuo of West Pokot (pictured), it dismissed the officials and directed their county governments to surcharge them for the per diem they earned for travelling to Nairobi for the meeting.The move amounted to misuse of public funds and a waste of the senators&rsquo; time, members said. They accused the governors of ignoring their oversight role.Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago and his Bomet counterpart Isaac Ruto did not turn up because they were held up on unspecified commitments.&ldquo;The purpose of this committee is not to waste public funds. We are here for serious business and it is important that governors know that. We must adopt more serious measures to show the governors that we are not here for child&rsquo;s play,&rdquo; Liza Chelule said.They said the per diems should be recovered from the governors&rsquo; pocket because they authorised their officers to travel. They directed that Mandago and Rutto provide proof of the recovered funds.Uasin Gishu Deputy Governor Daniel Chemno was dissatisfied with the committee&rsquo;s move to dismiss them, saying the Constitution allows him to represent Mandago and respond to questions related to his county. Rutto was represented by Finance executive David Cheruiyot.
