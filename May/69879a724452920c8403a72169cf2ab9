President Uhuru Kenyatta and opposition chief Raila Odinga's key allies could be dealt a staggering blow over dubious integrity, as the IEBC is determined to bar them from the August polls.And they won't know what hit them until they are told by returning officers from Sunday May 28 to Friday June 2.The impending secret blacklist is likely to trigger a huge political uproar, as there are indications quite a few influential leaders are among the casualties of the first-ever electoral clean-up.Vetting of 15,082 hopefuls by interagency teams of experts was completed yesterday. Their report will be sent to the electoral agency today.The list will be kept under wraps.In a shocker for high-flying candidates across the country, the Wafula Chebukati-led commission will confidentially instruct returning officers to reject nomination papers from blacklisted hopefuls.Aspirants won't be told in advance because they could rush to court seeking injunctions that are freely dispensed in Kenya, virtually at the drop of a hat.Targeted in the crackdown are candidates implicated in mega corruption scandals, those with dubious academic certificates, those with other corruption, criminal and hate speech cases.These details emerged yesterday as rights groups upped the pressure on the vetting team to block aspirants with questionable integrity.They named 20 politicians who should top the list of shame.Whether they are blacklisted and barred is less certain.The Star has established that most casualties of the vetting will be governors who control billions of shillings.Some county bosses are under probe by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission and have consistently been fingered in audit reports by Auditor General Edward Ouko.IEBC commissioner Roselyne Akombe said the electoral agency will rely on verdict of the investigating team to decide who should be locked out.&ldquo;We will write to all returning officers with clear instructions not to receive nomination papers from such candidates,&rdquo; Akombe told the Star on Tuesday.Presidential candidates will submit nomination papers to the IEBC chairman, who is the the presidential returning officer, on Sunday and Monday next week.This ushers in the official 60-day campaign period.Governors, senators and woman representative candidates have a date with county returning officers from May 28 to June 2.Parliamentary and MCA candidates will hand in their papers for clearance between June 1 and 2.A furore is expected.In 2013, Uhuru and running mate William Ruto, then facing crimes against humanity charges at the ICC, were allowed by the Supreme Court to run &mdash; in which many consider a precedent-setting ruling.However, critics say the integrity bar was raised when ex-Deputy Chief Justice Nancy Barasa was kicked from the helm of the judiciary for pinching the nose of a security guard. It was considered abuse of office."The Nancy Baraza Judicial Tribunal addressed and resolved Chapter 6 application on integrity. Issues of criminal records are only a part of a core set of integrity parameters, which were well developed by the tribunal," International Centre for Policy and Conflict Executive Director Ndungu Wainaina told the StarBut Society for International Development associate director Irungu Houghton insisted the multi-agency vetting team must have what he termed the courage to act, despite the apex court ruling on the ICC cases.&ldquo;We are at a different moment. There was no Chapter Six working group in 2013. We now have a Chapter Six working group,&rdquo; Irungu told journalists yesterday.The multi-agency vetting team &mdash; also known as the Chapter Six working group &mdash; consists of the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, the Commission on University Education, the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions.Others are the Department of Immigration and Registration of Persons, the Directorate of Criminal Investigations and the IEBC.In a report titled 'RedCard20', the rights groups, Transparency International, Mzalendo Trust, Inuka Trust, and the Society for International Development named key Raila and Uhuru allies who they say should be blocked as unfit for public officeAll have them have denied any wrongdoing and said they are victims of witch-hunts and malicious rivals.Among the big guns are Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero, his rival Senator Mike Sonko and Governors Hassan Joho of Mombasa, Ken Lusaka of Bungoma,Cyprian Awiti of Homa Bay, Alfred Mutua of Machakos and Mwangi Wairia of Murang'a.Other governors on the civil society ist of shame are Okoth Obado (Migori), his rival Ochilo Ayacko, Ferdinand Waititu (Kiambu), Ann Waiguru (Kirinyaga) and Kazungu Kambi (Kilifi)The six parliamentary candidates on the list are National Assembly Security Committee Chairman Asman Kamama (Tiaty), Alfred Keter (Nandi Hills), Elizabeth Ongoro (Ruaraka), Oscar Sudi (Kapseret), Mathew Lempurkel (Laikipia North) and Moses Kuria (Gatundu South).Also listed are former powerful Registrar of the Judiciary Gladys Boss Shollei (Uasin Gishu) and Dandora Area 2 MCA Stephen Kambi.&ldquo;After objective and impartial investigations, their track record does not indicate that they are fit to serve in an appointed or elected public office,&rdquo; Transparency International chief Samuel Kimeu told a joint civil society press conference yesterday.In their report, civil society groups say Kidero should be barred over Sh4.6 billion procurement irregularities involving the botched launch of a metro transportation system and allegations of a Sh200 million bribe to former Supreme Court Philip Tunoi. He denies wrongdoing.The rights lobby singles out what it calls Joho's alleged falsification of academic certificates as an integrity question that should bar him from seeking re-election.Waiguru, the ex-powerful devolution CS, is being haunted by the Sh1.9 billion scandal, with the civil society accusing her of presiding over the massive NYS rip-off. She says she's the victim and whistle blower.According to the lobby groups, Waititu, who is a heartbeat away from becoming the second Kiambu governor, had been declared unfit to hold office in 2015 by the High Court.The state-funded Kenya National Commission on Human Rights has moved to the Supreme Court, seeking to have aspirants with questionable integrity barred from election. It says many candidates cannot pass integrity tests.KNCHR has sought an advisory opinion from the court on standards and guidelines applying to leadership and integrity, as leaders seek clearance to vie.The agency wants the court to clarify the matter after the High Court and Court of Appeal issued conflicting interpretations of Chapter Six of the Constitution, which focuses on integrity.
