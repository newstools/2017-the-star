More than 15,000 Pokot residents in Tiaty subcounty are in a dire humanitarian crisis amid drought and an ongoing security operation in Baringo.Residents need food, shelter and clothing. The most vulnerable are the elderly, pregnant women and children. The number includes more than 5,000 herders who were forced back while herding their animals across the border of Baringo North and South subcounties. While on a tour on Wednesday, Kaptuya chief Albert Kenimak said 3,400 herders were camped in temporary structures at Kaptuya. Another 2,400 were sheltering inside tents at Tangulebei. &ldquo;This is the first time in history Pokots are spending nights in IDP camps,&rdquo; Kenimak said. Initially, he said about 10,000 residents were by affected drought, but after the herders migrated back, the number has added up to more than 15,000.
