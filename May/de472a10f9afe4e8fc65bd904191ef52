The government will take full responsibility of funding the school feeding programme for primary schoolchildren from next year, Education CS Fred Matiang&rsquo;i said yesterday.The programme has since inception in 1980 been funded by the World Food Programme and its partners for purposes of improving enrollment and retention of children in school in arid and semi arid areas and urban slums.Matiang&rsquo;i said the ministry has been allocated an additional Sh1.6 billion in the 2017-18 financial year for the programme that benefits more than 1.6 million children. He said, &ldquo;The business of how we feed our children is our responsibility as government and as Kenyans. We can&rsquo;t have meetings with others to tell us how to do it.&rdquo;The additional funding means the total government spending will be Sh2.5 billion from the Sh850,000 annual expenditure.
