The Jubilee government is not doing much to restore peace among the warring communities in Northeastern, Isiolo residents say.They said there are many conflicts that require long-lasting solutions. &ldquo;This is a reaction to the incident of cattle rustling at Kuori Dam on Friday on Borana herders by Samburu Rendile morans,&rdquo; said Isiolo ODM senatorial aspirant Abaroba Godana.The residents addressed the press at a hotel in Mlolongo town, Machakos county, on Saturday. &ldquo;About eight Borana herders died in the incident. Confirmed reports indicate six others were seriously injured while some are still missing,&rdquo; Godana said.He said more than 1,000 cattle, goats and sheep were driven away by the bandits. &ldquo;We the people of Isiolo, and especially Merti, condemn the attack on innocent Boranas from Merti subcounty,&rdquo; he added. Godana said they were saddened by the barbaric act on their brothers, &ldquo;This is extremely retrogressive, backward and unmodern in this century.&rdquo;
