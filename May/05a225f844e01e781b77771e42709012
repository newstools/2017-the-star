Ford Kenya leaders in western have warned ODM against any attempts to impose leaders on the electorate during the August poll.Youth league secretary Wafula Wakoli said the party has to honour recommendations barring them from fielding candidates in the region.Arguing that western is a Ford Kenya and Amani National Congress zone, he said ODM should keep off the area's politics.Wakoli said their party will not be blackmailed by ODM deputy leader Wycliffe Oparanya to cede ground in the Kakamega governor race.Oparanya and Senator Boni Khlawale are facing off in the competition for the county's top seat."ODM has been granted the opportunity to present Raila Odinga as the NASA flag bearer. They should leave Kakamega to Ford Kenya."While campaigning for Khalwale, NASA principal and Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula, said ODM should forget about winning seats in western.Wetang'ula leader said the party will clinch various seats including Kakamega, Bungoma, and Trans Nzoia governor.He said the party will support Paul Otuoma and Moses Akaranga in their bids for Busia and Vihiga governor respectively."We will not entertain any other ODM aspirant. Let Raila not dictate the kind of leaders who will be elected in western," Wetang'ula said."We will vote for NASA even if Musalia and I did not get the flag. For other seats, Raila should not impose people like Oparanya on us."Khalwale said Luhyas will not allow the imposition of a leader.But Oparanya has maintained that ODM will field candidates in all elective positions."The party has more popular candidates who will win majority seats for NASA," the Governor said.Also read: NASA parties still negotiating joint Nairobi candidates
