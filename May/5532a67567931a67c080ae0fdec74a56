Nairobi governor aspirant Miguna Miguna is busy campaigning. The barrister, who is hopeful that come August 7 he will beat his opponents Mike Sonko and incumbent Governor Evans Kidero, has always shared his manifesto and one of them is job creation.Netizens have been interacting with Miguna Miguna on Twitter, asking him questions, and he replied, but Churchill Show comedian Eddie Butita got blocked after going overboard. Or rather after asking the &lsquo;savage king&rsquo; an irrelevant question.&ldquo;Miguna Miguna, what do you do you think of #NairobiDiaries is it good for the county?" read Butita's tweet.Miguna Miguna did not respond to the question but went ahead to block Butita.
