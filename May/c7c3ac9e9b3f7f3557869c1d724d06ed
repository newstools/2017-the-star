Sebastian Vettel ended Ferrari&rsquo;s 16-year wait for a Monaco Grand Prix victory and extended his championship lead in the process with a commanding drive.Michael Schumacher&rsquo;s victory in 2001 was the Scuderia&rsquo;s last here, but the German took his second win in the principality after some blistering laps midway through the race. They allowed him to jump pole-sitter and team-mate Kimi Raikkonen at the pit-stops.The Finn finished second with Red Bull&rsquo;s Daniel Ricciardo completing the podium. Vettel&rsquo;s third win of the season moves him 25 points clear of Lewis Hamilton in this season&rsquo;s title race, as the Briton recovered from 13th on the grid to finish a creditable seventh.&ldquo;If anyone overtakes here I&rsquo;ll give you a tenner,&rdquo; said Jenson Button on the pre-race drivers&rsquo; parade.How right the returning 37-year-old was. Wheel-to-wheel action was scarce around the famously tight street circuit, emphasising the importance of the 200-metre run from pole position to turn one in Monaco. Raikkonen made the most of his first pole since the 2008 French Grand Prix, easily holding off Vettel into Sainte-Devote to keep his lead.In fact, so tame were the opening few seconds that the top seven all retained their positions.Starting 13th &ndash; also for the first time since that 2008 race in France &ndash; Hamilton was one of the few to make up places, getting up the inside of Stoffel Vandoorne off the line.
