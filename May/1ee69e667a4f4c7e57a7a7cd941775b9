Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua (pictured) has hit out at Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka for nominating his son to the EALA. Speaking in the Machakos People&rsquo;s Park on Saturday, when he hosted 10, 000 leaders from the region, Mutua described the move as a show of selfish leadership. &ldquo;It is a shame. This shows he cares very little about the rest of the people,&rdquo; he said.
