Meru senator aspirant Kobia Maranya yesterday caused a buzz in town after he used a donkey handcart to present his nomination papers.He said there is no need of extravagance in campaigns.Maranya is an independent candidate. He said he used the donkeys to show his humility.&ldquo;My competitors have bought cars worth Sh50 million, choppers worth Sh500 million, while our people continue to languish in poverty. I will instead use Sh2 million, the money I would have used in the nomination, to buy food for the poor,&rdquo; Maranya said.He compared the process of being given nomination papers to a wedding.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just like a wedding. If you go to a wedding with two witnesses you will still get your marriage certificate. It does not mean God will not bless you,&rdquo; Maranya said.
