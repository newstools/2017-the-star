The race for the Nakuru West MP seat will be an all Kisii affair in the August 8 general election.Jubilee Party nominee Samuel Arama will face off with his fellow tribesman Isoe Ochoki who clinched the ODM party ticket in the primaries. The duo are the only candidates who will run for the seat in the cosmopolitan constituency. Nakuru West is home to Kisii, Kikuyu, Kalenjin, Luo and Luhya communities. The area is considered to be an ODM zone, and Arama was elected on the party&rsquo;s ticket in 2013. But he defected to Jubilee Party. Jubilee officials in the Nakuru county said they are confident the incumbent will retain his seat on the JP ticket. But an ODM official who declined to be named said Ochoki has the full support of party leader Raila Odinga and will trounce Arama. &ldquo;I will win the seat because Ochoki is no match for me,&rdquo; Arama said.
