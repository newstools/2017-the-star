Two people were severely injured on Wednesday after the vehicle they were test-driving veered off and crashed on Maralal-Nyahururu road, Samburu subcounty. The two were rushed to Samburu Referral Hospital, after which one of the casualties was referred to Kenyatta National Hospital for specialised treatment. A doctor told journalists he had severe injuries on the upper part of his body. "The vehicle was headed to Suguta from Maralal when the driver lost control, hitting several trees along the road reserve," said Samburu Central OCPD Abagaro Guyo. GuyoÂ said they were investigating to establish if the driver, said to be a mechanic, had a valid licence. He asked motorists to be more careful as the road is in a bad state. The wreckage was towed to Maralal police station.
