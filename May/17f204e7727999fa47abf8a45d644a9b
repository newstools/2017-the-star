Three children of Eldoret MCA aspirant James Ratemo Nyambane have been found murdered and their bodies dumped in River Nzoia five days after they went missing.Clifford (seven), Glen (three) and Taya (five) were reported missing last Saturday. They did not return home after leaving for Eldovil SDA Church.Taya was a class one pupil of Shalom Academy while Clifton attended Highlands Academy.Their father is vying for the Kapsoya ward representative seat on a Kanu ticket.The family had put up posters of the children amid a search for them. The bodies were found on Thursday night.Their uncle Enock Onsanze was arrested on Friday as he was the one last seen with them. He had already been charged with abduction.&ldquo;I wonder why someone would do this to my children. It&rsquo;s too much for me to bear and I just leave everything to God&rdquo;, said Nyambane.He ruled out politics in connection with the killing and said he had not differed with any of his opponents or any other politician.&ldquo;I just hope police will help us to unravel what happened causing the killing of my children&rdquo;, said Nyambane. His wife Ebby who is mother to children said she could not believe that they had been killed.A caretaker at the home said he had escorted the children to go church but just next to their house he met with a cousin to the family who offered to go with the children to the church which is located about three kilometers away.The cousin however met with an uncle to the children who offered to take the children to the church and that was the last time they were seen.Villagers at Machine village near Mois Bridge along River Nzoia spotted the bodies on Monday floating in the river and informed the local administration which called the police to retrieve them.One of the bodies was retrieved on Tuesday, the second one on Wednesday while the last one was retrieved yesterday.The area chief at Mois Bridge had seen in the media about the missing children and alerted police in Eldoret who traced Nyambane&rsquo;s family to inform them of the discovery. The bodies were yesterday moved to Eldoret from Kitale.The uncle to the children Enock Onsanze is still being held by the police in connection with the killing. Hundreds of people thronged Nyambane&rsquo;s home to console the family. The aspirant also said he has no family differences that could lead to such an incident.&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe my children are dead I can&rsquo;t just believe&rdquo;, said Ebby who works at the Moi Referral Hospital.Independent Governor Aspirant for Uasin Gishu Bundotich Kiprop urged the police to investigate the matter thoroughly and bring those involved to book.
