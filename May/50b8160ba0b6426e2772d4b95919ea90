Some Northeastern leaders have expressed concerns that the recent attacks in the region have not received adequate attention.They now fear al Shabaab could take over the region. The leaders have listed attacks on communication masts, killing of chiefs and the recent IED explosions in Mandera and Garissa as the cause for alarm.Speaking during the burial of officers who died in the IED explosion on Thursday, Wajir Governor Ahmed Abdullahi said the country should be careful not to lose the North to the terror group. &ldquo;The continuous attacks that are happening are dangerous and if communication equipment can be destroyed by terror groups and no one minds, then it is my fear that we could be conceding and losing a part of the country to the terror group,&rdquo; he said.Mandera Governor Ali Roba urged residents to be vigilant. He told the national government to step in urgently and address the issue of insecurity in the region. &ldquo;Over an year, masts have been brought down by these terror groups, but nothing much has been done to repair the network masts,&rdquo; Roba said.
