Gullible candidates for Embu governor may have lost more than Sh1 million buying the support of a group of women and men who claim they were supporters of MP Cecile Mbarire and are now looking for a political home. The MP was defeated in the Jubilee primaries and has personally not endorsed any candidate. But the group has &ldquo;endorsed&rdquo; two competing candidates on two consecutive weekends. It consists of a spokeswoman, dancers and some male &ldquo;elders&rdquo;. Word has it is they are now shopping for more candidates for MP, Senator, and woman rep seats who they can conveniently &ldquo;endorse&rdquo;. Residents of the county are not amused. ***** Have some Trans Nzoia county chief officers gone on a go-slow or are they busy campaigning? Residents are concerned building plans supposed to be approved by a committee are piling up as the team has not met for two months, leaving a big number of projects at a standstill. Applicants pay a good amount for the approvals and have set timelines for their projects and the delay is not doing them any good. ***** A Jubilee lobby group claiming to be campaigning for President Uhuru Kenyatta is terrorising businessmen in Nairobi. The group, led by two men who claim to be relatives of the President, has been moving from one shop to another fleecing businessman of their money, ostensibly to lobby for Uhuru&rsquo;s reelection. One businessman of Indian origin parted with some Sh5 million on Monday to the con-men disguised as the President&rsquo;s campaign team. ***** A sitting MCA from a ward in Kasarani is said to have panicked after residents smoked him out of his hideout. The MCA disappeared from the political scene after he lost in the Jubilee primaries, but stopped construction work at two critical link roads. Whether it was to punish the electorate or he wanted to make a killing, the act has angered residents. In groups of tens, the residents walked to his new home in Kahawa Sukari, where they demanded an explanation. The MCA pleaded with the locals to spare him, as he promised to make sure the &lsquo;contractor&rsquo; returns to the site. He is said to have pocketed millions from ghost projects.*****Did NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga just reach out to his running mate Kalonzo Musyoka yesterday, following a political feud between the former VP and Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama? Well, we are informed that the opposition chief held a lengthy telephone conversation with Kalonzo over the issue. While details of the discussion remain scant, our small bird tells us that the two dwelt on the Muthama issue and agreed to both meet the senator for &lsquo;lunch&rsquo; to sort out an issue that, if not checked. may well puncture the opposition presidential campaigns.
