Celebrated gospel star Ben Githae is at pains to explain why he has used his massive influence to churn out a catchy political tune for the Jubilee camp. His single, Uhuru Ruto Tano Tena is a call for voters to give the two another term to run the country. "Supportive messages regarding my song were plenty compared to the criticism. I support Jubilee, I am one of the brand ambassadors in the Team Uhuru Tano Tena campaign, I had to come up with something creative," Ben Gitae told Word Is. He continued, "I also have a democratic right to support whoever I like and I have been doing political rallies since 2011 so it shouldn't be an issue. I have not lost a fan, if I have then those are NASA supporters." When asked about how much he was paid for the sizzling single, Githae said that is his personal secret and couldnâ€™t say if he was paid or not. He actually confirmed that he will still continue doing gospel despite what people think of him.
