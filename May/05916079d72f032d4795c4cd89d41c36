Wiper&rsquo;s Machakos governor nominee Wavinya Ndeti yesterday urged her rival Bernard Kiala to join forces with her so they can form the next county administration.Ndeti won the Sunday party primaries. She praised Kiala for being a worthy competitor and added it was time they worked together to ensure party unity. She garnered 299,312 votes against Kiala&rsquo;s 4,663.&ldquo;I actually want to thank Bernard. I call upon him to join us. There is room for everybody. He is like a brother and I love him. Machakos county is bigger than any one of us,&rdquo; an upbeat Ndeti said.Kiala dismissed the overtures, saying the primary was conducted against a court order. He told Ndeti to wait for a court ruling on Wednesday. Kiala on Saturday obtained a court order stopping the exercise, saying its outcome had been predetermined.But Ndeti said it was out of respect for Wiper that she agreed to subject herself to a primary, despite a deal the Chama Cha Uzalendo made with the Kalonzo Musyoka-led outfit.&ldquo;The Wiper leader found it difficult to ask me to go for nominations with Kiala when there was a signed agreement in place. But because I was confident and knew I had done my groundwork well, I overlooked the agreement and decided to battle it out,&rdquo; Ndeti said.She thanked residents for turning up en masse to vote for her as the Wiper torchbearer and assured them of real development should she win.Ndeti&rsquo;s running-mate Peter Mathuki said their win has given them a revived spirit to face Governor Alfred Mutua.He said their administration will not allow the infighting that has permeated the Mutua administration in the past four years. Mutua fell out with Deputy Governor Kiala.&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll work as a team to provide much-needed services.&rdquo;
