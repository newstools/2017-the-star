Two women aspirants in Northeastern will battle it out for elective posts in a region where leadership is the preserve of men. Doris Gichuki, a Kikuyu running for MCA in Garissa, is among the women who have defied the region&rsquo;s patriarchal society that shuns women leaders. No woman from Northeastern has ever been elected MP or a member of the county assembly due to the community&rsquo;s rigid culture.Speaking to the Star yesterday, Gichuki said she grew up in Garissa town where she attended primary and secondary schools. She launched her campaign in Garissa town, and urged the electorate not to look at her as an outsider, but one of their own. Gichuki said she is best placed for the seat because she understands the needs of residents and can transform their lives.&ldquo;I was one-year-old when my father and I moved to Garissa. He was working for the Kenya Power and Lighting Company. So, I grew here and I&rsquo;m part and parcel of Garissa residents,&rdquo; she said.Gichuki will run against 14 other contestants.Mulki Warsame refused to run for woman rep and instead will face off with men in Iftin ward. &ldquo;I decided to contest for the county assembly to ensure people at the grassroots enjoy the fruits of devolution,&rdquo; she said yesterday.Saritho Mowsar, who is in the contest for Sangailu MCA, said people need to elect women leaders for tangible development. &ldquo;They understand the problems,&rdquo; she said.
