NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga yesterday urged losers in the primaries to stick with him, saying they will be part of his new administration.&ldquo;Nominations are part of the electoral process. I request everyone, including those who lost, to remain strong in the party,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;When we form the next government, they will have a crucial role to play.&rdquo;Raila said the Jubilee administration&rsquo;s days are numbered, adding that &ldquo;the wave of change is sweeping across the country because Kenyans want to be well-governed&rdquo;.He said NASA continues to grow nationwide.&ldquo;Our competitors should stop blackmailing the opposition and see the numbers,&rdquo; Raila said.His lawyers are working round the clock to establish if the alliance will field a candidate under NASA or ODM.At the 2013 election, Raila and then-running mate Kalonzo Musyoka run under ODM, despite working together under Cord.Raila accused the Jubilee administration of working closely with Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to come up with laws that micromanage party activities.&ldquo;The high numbers of independent candidates is because Jubilee wanted to stop people from defecting from their parties. But Kenyans have grown democratically and they know what is good for them,&rdquo; he said.The former Prime Minister said the new IEBC rules limit the duration the parties can conduct repeat polls in case some contestants have genuine grievances.He added that the laws do not provide a free and fair democratic environment for parties to operate.&ldquo;As ODM, we wanted to start early and ensure the process was smooth. Unfortunately, the IEBC told us it was illegal and we had to wait until they gazetted,&rdquo; Raila said.&ldquo;Parties are like societies and should not be micromanaged. They should conduct their activities in a structured manner.&rdquo; He spoke at the NASA secretariat in Capitol Hill, Nairobi, where he received politicians from Mount Kenya who joined the outfit.Former Subukia MP Koigi Wamwere said he was confident NASA will form the next government.&ldquo;We have joined NASA to push for the change we want us a country,&rdquo; he said. Former Minister Kirugi M&rsquo;Mukindia was also present.
