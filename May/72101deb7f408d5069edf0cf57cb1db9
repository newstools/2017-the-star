Maendeleo Chap Chap is fielding candidates for all seats apart from the president."I was in government for 10 years and saw MPs demand bribes from ministers to shoot down certain motions or support others.""Even after I was elected governor, there were senators who would demand even Sh5 million from governors so as not to recommend their probe," Mutua said.He said the party intends to field men and women of integrity to begin the change of leadership in the country."Our elected leaders engage in corruption thus denying the electorate quality representation," Mutua said.Mutua said at MCC headquarters in Nairobi that graft has derailed Kenya&rsquo;s economic growth and delivery of services."My party intends to reform the country&rsquo;s political leadership by weeding out such practices."He spoke when he received nomination certificate to defend his seat on MCC ticket from the party&rsquo;s elections board chairman Wilfred Nyamu.Senator Lenny Kivuti was issued the certificate for Embu governor, Vincent Musyoka (Mwala MP) and Gitobu Imanyara for Imenti Central MP.Nominated MP Robert Mutemi, who will be running for the Mwingi West MP, and Tharaka Nithi senator aspirant Francis Kiambi were also issued certificates.Nakuru and Narok women rep aspirants Assumpta Wangui and Josephine Koloo respectively were also cleared by the party.This was also the case for Nyandarua governor aspirant Frank Muchina and Wajir East MP aspirant Ali Maamud.Nyamu said those awarded the certificates were the bonafide winners of the party's nominations.
