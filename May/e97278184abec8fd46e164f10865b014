Expect to receive water for at least one more day a week if the rains persist.The Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company yesterday said the water level at the Ndakaini Dam &ldquo;is improving&rdquo; and the company will review the rationing schedule in a week if it keeps raining.&ldquo;The level is still below 25 per cent but, the way the rains are pounding, the level will be above 30 per cent by next week,&rdquo; head of corporate affairs Mbaruku Vyakweli said on the phone.This will come as good news to many residents, especially those living in informal settlements, who have been digging deeper into their pockets to buy the commodity. Residents receive water for a maximum of three days per week. But some, especially those in Eastlands, say they do not receive water at all and are forced to buy from vendors, who have hiked the prices.The city has experienced acute water shortage since January because of the fall in levels at the Ndakaini Dam.The dam supplies 84 per cent of water used in the city.The level has been at an all-time low &ndash; less than 25 per cent. This was caused by drought in the Aberdares, Kikuyu and Mt Kenya, the main water catchments for rivers feeding the dam.This forced the water company to tighten rationing.Most residents have been spending up to Sh80 for a 20-litre jerrycan of water from vendors. Some residents said they have not received water for a long time and have relied on vendors and salty water from boreholes.&ldquo;I have been spending Sh5,000 per month since January in buying water alone. I have not paid rent, I have not bought unga. This life is just unbearable,&rdquo; Umoja 1 resident Gabriel Nyongesa said. The weatherman has warned of inadequate rainfall in some parts of the country.
