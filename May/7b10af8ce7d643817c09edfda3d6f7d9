Former Nairobi PC Joseph Kaguthi wants Central Kenya to embrace polygamy, and faulted the clergy for opposing the practice blindly.Kaguthi, the chairman of National Committee for Implementation of Citizen Participation in Security, or Nyumba Kumi, said polygamy is enshrined in the Bible. &ldquo;This movement being led by married women in the Central Kenya that polygamy is illegal should stop if we have to increase our population,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;The President of Kenya is a product of a polygamous family. I come from that set of a union and there is nothing wrong in it being reintroduced in Central.&rdquo; Bishop (Rtd) Peter Njenga of the Anglican Church supported him. Kaguthi was speaking during a meeting on community policing. Elders, the clergy and youth leaders from six counties attended the forum in Naivasha.
