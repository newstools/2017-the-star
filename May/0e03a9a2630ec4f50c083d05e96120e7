Charles Njagua Kanyi, also known by his street moniker Jaguar, is now on the campaign trail in a bid to clinch the Starehe Parliamentary seat come August.The rapper-turned-politician introduced his father to his future constituents on the ground and on social media. This comes after Jagua confessed that his father was a recovering alcoholic. He checked his father into a rehab in Nyeri and told his online followers that: "It has been a long journey battling the addiction, but I believe he is finally overcoming it."Here are some reactions:Humphrey Mageso: That's good Kanyi... But don't expose too much of your profile, especially family. Wanasiasa ni wale wale, they will use that to break you down before you make a move...Just sell your manifesto to Starehe residents.Mirrie Kimiri: Best advice comes from parents....shikilia baba atakupea mawaidha poa.
