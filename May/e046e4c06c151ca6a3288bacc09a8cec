More than 800 nurses from Nyeri county say they will continue boycotting work as the county government has issued them with fake promotion letters.Kenya National Union of Nurses Nyeri branch secretary Beatrice Nduati said they have waited for a response from the county government for three weeks but no one has addressed their grievances.She said they are being shortchanged.Nduati said that the irregular promotion letters were given to 438 nurses out of 500 interviewed. &ldquo;It is totally unacceptable to change terms of agreement without consulting us. We will not accept these letters because to us they are fake,&rdquo; she told journalists in Nyeri town on Wednesday.Nduati also said the county government did not give letters of appointment to nurses recruited recently.She said nurses will only resume work after all the issues raised have been addressed fully and will not accept partial fulfilment that the government is attempting to use to divide and rule them.The nurses started their strike three weeks ago, demanding promotions and hiring of additional staff.Health executive Charles Githinji could not be reached for a comment. His phone was switched off.
