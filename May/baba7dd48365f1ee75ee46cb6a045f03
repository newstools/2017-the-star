NASA Pentagon member Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula yesterday said they have confidence in the IEBC, but warned the Jubilee administration against micromanaging the commission.He accused President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s Jubilee Party of influencing decisions the IEBC has been making ahead of the upcoming election.&ldquo;We demand that Jubilee stops forthwith interfering with the running of the IEBC,&rdquo; he said during a meeting with Ford Kenya nominees in Bungoma.&ldquo;We particularly take issue with IEBC&rsquo;s move to dispatch members of one community to oversee the election in Bungoma and Kakamega.&rdquo;There has been a public outrage at the IEBC&rsquo;s list of officers &mdash; many of them are Kalenjins &mdash; to manage elections in Western and Nyanza. NASA, led by flagbearer Raila Odinga, said it is Jubilee&rsquo;s ploy with IEBC to rig the election. &ldquo;We have no problem with any Kenyan tribe, but an act of profiling who is best-suited to supervise elections in some parts of the country is unacceptable,&rdquo; he said, urging the Wafula Chebukati-led IEBC to expeditiously correct the anomaly.Wetang&rsquo;ula maintained that the NASA administration will review all multibillion contracts signed between the Jubilee administration and other countries.He said they will not allow &ldquo;ravenous and meaningless&rdquo; contracts that have ballooned the national debt to about Sh4 trillion to continue hurting taxpayers. &ldquo;As a country, we can&rsquo;t continue borrowing endlessly in disregard of sound advice from reputable international partners like the World Bank,&rdquo; Wetang&rsquo;ula said.&ldquo;I want to put Jubilee on notice that as NASA administration, we will review and abrogate all contracts they have signed with other countries without sufficient justification and on fraudulent considerations.&rdquo;He warned Uhuru and DP William Ruto against plunging the country into bankruptcy and instead listen to advice given by international financial institutions. Wetang&rsquo;ula criticised Ruto for accusing NASA, especially Raila&rsquo;s running mate Kalonzo Musyoka, of nepotism following Wiper&rsquo;s decision to nominate his son Kennedy Musyoka for approval to East African Legislative Assembly.He said Ruto appointed his &ldquo;underage daughter&rdquo; as Kenyan deputy ambassador to Rome and added that Uhuru&rsquo;s relatives hold senior positions in government. &ldquo;Tell me which member of Uhuru&rsquo;s family is not holding a senior position in government, including his clinically senile siblings. If Jubilee continues with lies about us, we&rsquo;ll continue speaking the truth,&rdquo; the senator said.He also told Governor Kenneth Lusaka to prepare to leave office, saying he belongs in Kamiti Prison after looting Bungoma county.
