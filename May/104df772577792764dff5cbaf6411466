City Hall officials on Wednesday clamped down the Aga Khan Sports Centre in Nairobi over Sh4.7 million rates arrears.The officers posted a signage showing that the facility is now under the management of the county government."Any tenant will now pay rent directly to City Hall until we recover all the arrears," John Ntoiti, who led the operation, said.He said the Sports Centre is among the many properties owned by the Aga Khan Foundation which owes the county a total of Sh150 million."The Foundation owns many properties. They have hospitals, schools, and car parks but they don&rsquo;t pay rates," he said.Maendeleo House in the city centre was spared after the management cleared Sh450,000 arrears.This was just moments before the building was clamped.Ntoiti said huge debt by property owners has hampered effective service delivery to the residents.He warned that properties of defiant debtors will be auctioned, adding that last year, the county auctioned 10 buildings and recovered the money."We cannot effectively collect garbage or repair roads because property owners do not want to pay us," he said.Ntoiti said the national government owes the county Sh69.5 billion in arrears accrued from land rates and parking charges.The county has been clamping down both public and private premises in a bid to recover billions of shillings it is owed.Also read: State could deny counties income from land rates
