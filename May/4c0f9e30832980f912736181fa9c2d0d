Hopefuls in Kakamega county have protested against alleged skewed staffing of election officials by the IEBC in what they termed pre-rigging plans.Speaking after meeting Kakamega county IEBC manager Grace Rono at Golf Hotel on Tuesday, candidates said returning officers from one community have been overwhelmingly deployed to manage county polls.&ldquo;We&rsquo;re anxious and worried that these officers may have been sent here with a specific brief,&rdquo; governor aspirant Boni Khalwale said.Seven of the 12 returning officers in Kakamega county are from the Kalenjin community.He said the officers should be reshuffled to reflect the face of Kenya to ensure free, fair and credible polls.Khalwale said all aspirants are committed to peaceful campaigns.&ldquo;We are aware that we&rsquo;re competing against each other, but we are committed to confining the competition to winning votes. We do not wish to compete in terms of who is more violent,&rdquo; he said. Khalwale said the IEBC office in Kakamega is not prepared.Kakamega senator aspirant Cleophas Malala of ANC said the electoral agency is behaving like an appendage of Jubilee.&ldquo;If a returning officer does not know what the requirements for a Senate candidate are, then you cannot tell us she knows what to do and this is a disaster in waiting,&rdquo; he said.Khalwale also asked Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery to stop intimidating the opposition in their campaigns.NKAISSERY HAS NO ROLEHe said, &ldquo;It is interesting Nkaissery finds nothing wrong with Jubilee telling Kenyans they have 70 Plus One victory, but reprimands NASA for being on the brink of inciting Kenyans when we say we are 10 Million Strong.&rdquo;He said that Nkaissery has no role in the electioneering process.But Jubilee governor candidate Marble Muruli defended the IEBC, saying it was ready to handle the election.She did not comment on the skewed deployment of returning officers by the commission.Muruli said, &ldquo;Let the people decide. Khalwale is my brother and I will not contest if he beats me.&rdquo;During the meeting, Rono asked for time to consult commission headquarters on what clearance requirements for candidates are.The government has warned aspirants with questionable integrity or dubious academic certificates to prepare for shock as they will be locked out of the August 8 polls.IEBC commissioner Roselyne Akombe has told aspirants they will be vetted thoroughly by experts from various agencies and branches of the government.She said the commission will advise all returning officers to reject candidates who will fail vetting.Agencies and offices involved in vetting are the Commission on University Education, the Attorney General, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Department of Immigration and Registration of Persons, the Directorate of Criminal Investigations, the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission and the IEBC.The agency is examining whether the hopefuls possess the academic qualifications and integrity to run for public office.A number of aspirants, including Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho and Kapsaret MP Oscar Sudi, are battling cases over forgery of academic certificates.Presidential aspirants, governors and all their running mates are required to hold at least a university degree from a recognised institution. MPs and senators require a post-secondary certificate.There is a question, however, whether the IEBC can bar someone with a court case if alla appeals have not been exhausted.
