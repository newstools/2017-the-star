Three children were recently butchered and their bodies found in the River Nzoia in Uasin Gishu. An MCA aspirant was abducted and his body found in the Donyo Sabuk River.These three killings appear to be related to electioneering.It is absolutely wrong for political differences to result in murder. The children&rsquo;s throats were slit, a slaughter of the innocents and a totally insane thing to do.Political discourse and competition are supposed to improve as many lives as possible, not snuff some out. Somewhere out there, there are two sets of killers waiting to enter two county assemblies.The police should move fast and conclusively, bring watertight cases to court and put away the killers.Most importantly, criminal intelligence DCI and the security service NIS need to up their game and forestall some of these atrocities. The abduction of the MCA, who went missing for five days, ought to have produced some significant leads by now.The DCI and NIS need to return to preventive and swift actions in this sensitive electioneering period.
