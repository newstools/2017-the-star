Busia Governor has dismissed as lies a paid-up advertisement by the national government that it has disbursed Sh3 billion to settle doctors&rsquo; salaries for the three months they were on strike.The ad said the counties got Sh3 billion and Busia had more than Sh60 million.&ldquo;The government published lies. No county has received the funds as alleged by the Treasury,&rdquo; Ojaamong said on Saturday in Busia town.&ldquo;As a county that values the lives of its citizens, we used other means to pay the doctors as we wait the national government to remit the funds.&rdquo; He told doctors from the counties that have yet to pay to blame the national government.The county boss told the Treasury to shelve its plan to freeze funds to the counties at the end of this month, saying it will hurt services.&ldquo;Contractors have started repossessing completed projects until they are paid,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Service delivery has to continue even during transitions. Nobody will run away because the system has captured contractors&rsquo; details.&rdquo;Meanwhile, Ojaamong warned former ODM officials, especially from Nambale, against pretending they are party members and issuing statements &ldquo;on behalf of the party&rdquo;.&ldquo;The ODM Nambale chairperson is Margaret Kamito and no other person should claim the position.&rdquo;He also cautioned defectors, who back independents, against issuing ultimatums to party leader Raila Odinga, saying the NASA flagbearer is free to drum up support for the coalition&rsquo;s candidates.Independents want Raila not to campaign for NASA candidates and instead focus on his bid.
