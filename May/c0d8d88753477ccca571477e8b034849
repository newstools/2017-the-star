IT seems President Uhuru Kenyatta may face a hard time campaigning in Central Kenya. This is because a group of leaders who were voted out or first-time aspirants in the Jubilee primaries who believe the process was not free and fair are not ready to join him in the campaigns. Losers are reluctant to join Jubilee Party's top brass in Central Kenya campaigns. A group of supporters at the constituencies level have also sworn not to hear anything to do with Jubilee. They called one vernacular radio station and said the leader of their choice was rigged out and that the highest bidder was given the certificate, they are now saying President Uhuru will be voted for under Jubilee only if he keeps out of constituency and ward politics. *****************A number of aspirants who eyed party tickets for the positions of governors and lost are silently jostling to be named as deputy governors. Though a good number feel the primaries were not free and fair, most now believe the position of a running mate still suits them. And they have seriously invested in lobbying. Former Konoin MP Julius Kones, who eyed the JP Bomet ticket, vowed not to deputise Deputy Speaker Joyce Laboso. Kones believes the position is too junior for him, having served as Konoin MP. The former lawmaker said on his official Facebook account: &ldquo;For the record, any insinuation that I had or have an interest in being a running mate of Dr Laboso or any other person for that matter is misguided or driven by own motive. The DG post is too junior for me." However, Kones committed himself to serve the nation in another capacity. He assured his supporters that he will be strategically placed to play part in the nation building process.****************THE University of Nairobi seems to be an institution under siege. Corridors is reliably informed UoN might be struggling to service loans. It raises questions on the management of the learning institution. Word has it that workers on contract have not been paid their salaries since January this year. Some of those on six-month contracts have also not been paid - since November last year. The kitchen baptised as the Mess has no food. Students are being forced to buy food from outside. Suppliers have not been supplying food, claiming that they have not received their payment from the institution.*******************CORRIDORS is curious why aspirants serving in Parliament as elected leaders and who lost during the Jubilee nominations humbled themselves in a single day. Starehe MP Maina Kamanda and Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau are among them. Corridors is wondering who might have talked to them and what they were promised. Jubilee Party is known not to keep promises following complaints from the officials of parties who merged. Will they this time keep the promise if it's true that the losers were promised soft-landing spots.
