After leaving Citizen TV, Janet Mbugua has now decided to take a different path to concentrate on her young family and her growing blog.Janet's husband Eddie Ndichu has an identical twin and it's quite easy to confuse the two. But during an interview with Word Is, she said she has never confused her husband for his twin, which is something many would have thought has happened before."They look very alike but I think we got to know each other to a point it wasn't confusing."On what attracted her to her husband, she said: "It just clicked and we dated for a few years before we got married. I can say he's my best friend."When asked about what TV girls go through in the newsroom, she said there is a misconception about them based on where they are in their careers."We are judged, good or bad, and no matter what we say, we are all judged. It's something we have to live with. There's a misconception that a lot of us got to where we are because we slept our way to the top or because we look a certain way, and no matter what we say or do, people won't change their perception. We also have a lot of pressure because a lot of us have families now and no one understands the pressure we feel of trying to juggle a family and still trying to be a public figure," Janet said."It's very hard. I feel like, especially with my former colleagues at Citizen, Lillian Muli and Anne Kiguta, we talk a lot, so it's nice to have that support and understanding. And to talk to each other without the judgment."
