The Independent Electoral Boundaries Commission yesterday said the biometric verification of voters&rsquo; register is going on with minimal hitches. The exercise started on May 11. IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati said 11,000 Kenya Integrated Elections Management System kits are being used in the country and abroad. Some 10,850 kits are in wards, 138 in prisons and 12 kits in the diaspora.&ldquo;For the wards, we have deployed between three to 10 kits depending on the geographical size and the population of registered voters,&rdquo; Chebukati said.KIEMS kits distribution formula is similar to the one applied in the distribution of BVR kits during the second mass voter registration exercise.Chebukati said the use of biometrics for verification and authentication is a legal requirement, and represents the best approach to strengthen the integrity of voter identification. Verification ends on June 9.Chebukati (pictured) said in the event a voter finds their particulars missing or incorrect, the voter should fill a claim form given by verification clerks. He said the form will be taken to the constituency registration officer who will carry out a background search to determine if a claim is genuine.Chebukati said the exercise cannot detect all possible errors. It also cannot, without further control measures, identify and expunge names of deceased persons from the database. &ldquo;Therefore the ongoing audit by KPMG is crucial towards securing integrity of the register,&rdquo; Chebukati said.
