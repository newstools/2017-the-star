Changamwe politician Peterson Mitau will now run for Changamwe MP as an independent. He has been tussling with the Wiper over the party ticket, which was issued to Daniel Muange. Mitau said he won in the primaries and contested Muange&rsquo;s victory, but the High Court upheld the rival&rsquo;s victory. On Wednesday, Mitau said the war is not over. &ldquo;Let them wait for August 8. I will beat all of them,&rdquo; he said in Kalahari, Changamwe, where he donated Sh1 million food to residents whose houses were destroyed in a downpour. In a rejoinder, Muange yesterday said Mitau is deluded and bitter about losing the ticket. He told Mitau to join him so they can work together for the benefit of residents. Muange said, &ldquo;Mitau needs to relax. We&rsquo;re all leaders. We should set good examples. I&rsquo;m ready to work with him so he&rsquo;s not left out in the cold.&rdquo;
