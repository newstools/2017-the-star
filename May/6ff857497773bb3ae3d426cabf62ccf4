The NASA team has threatened to boycott August polls if IEBC amends law stopping declaration of presidential results at the polling station.The coordinating committee led by James Orengo told the electoral agency to withdraw the petition challenging the High court decision on tallying.The court on April 7 ruled that presidential results declared at the polling station and constituency during the August 8 polls will be final.The said results cannot be overturned unless by the order of the court, the ruling stated.Read: Presidential poll results declared at constituency tallying centre final - court"In which interest is this appeal made? That's mischief and we will not participate in the elections of 2017," Orengo said.IEBC has described as &ldquo;a recipe for chaos&rdquo; a court declaration that presidential results announced at the constituency are final.Chairman Wafula Chebukati said: "I was dismayed by that ruling for the simple reason that presidential results are supposed to be announced at the national tallying centre by the national returning officer, who is the chairman of the IEBC. That is very clear in the law,"But NASA leaders told journalists at Moi International Airport, Mombasa that IEBC's assertions means they have been changing results.Also read: Court ruling on presidential results is recipe for disaster - ChebukatiThey also claimed that the electoral commission has been arbitrarily deploying and sending returning officers without any basis.The opposition team demanded that the commission adopts an open and transparent process of deploying constituency ROs."The process should invoke open balloting where constituency coordinators are randomly picked and their constituencies selected," Isiolo deputy governor Gulleid Mohammed said.The team also demanded that the EVID kits be subjected to public inspection to confirm if they are suitable for the intended purpose."They should be deployed and distributed to all polling stations for purposes of supplementing the voter verification process," the Siaya senator said.On the Kilifi retreat, the team said they had serious discussions on how to unseat the Jubilee administration."There is no way Jubilee is going to win. We have looked at the numbers. We are soon rolling out activities starting with a rally in Nakuru.""This should be finalised by end of the week," Orengo added.On the unconstitutional positions created to accommodate NASA pentagon members, Orengo said they are not bound to use the existing names."We have consulted with our team of lawyers on the matter," he said.Raila's running mate is Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka.Musalia Mudavadi (ANC), Moses Wetang'ula (Ford Kenya), and Isaac Rutto (CCM) also joined forces to form the National Super Alliance.
