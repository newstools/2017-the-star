The maize shortage in Kenya is artificial as a cartel of traders and millers are hoarding it to control prices, former Naivasha MP John Mututho said on Wednesday.He spoke a day after the government announced maize subsidies and said a 2kg unga packet will retail at Sh90.Twenty millers will be involved in the programme as the government moved ahead to allow the importation of duty free maize, milk powder and sugar.But Mututho told journalists in Naivasha that the cartel is working with government officers to control the prices.He urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to use the state machine to unmask those who hoarded maize, leading to a crisis.&ldquo;When I was in Parliament the same cartel was responsible for hoarding the commodity and later releasing it in the market at a high price,&rdquo; the former Nacada chairman said.
