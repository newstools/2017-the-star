Nyanza residents have urged the reconstitution of NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga’s (pictured) campaign team in the region. Kisumu Residents’ Voice Association chairman Audi Ogada and Homa Bay Bunge la Wananchi speaker Walter Opiyo yesterday urged ODM and NASA to restructure the team picked to spearhead campaigns in Homa Bay, Migori, Kisumu and Siaya. They said those tasked with leading campaigns face stiff competition from their opponents and are likely to focus on their interests, to the detriment of Raila’s bid. The two spoke to the Star separately. They want ODM county bosses to lead the campaigns, saying the officials are neutral and are not running for elective seats. “It will be prudent if neutral people are included in the campaign process,” Ogada said. Opiyo shared similar sentiments.
