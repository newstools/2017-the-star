During a visit to Turkana in March,President Uhuru Kenyatta claimed that the revenue allocations to the county were equivalent to the total amount sent to Kiambu and Uasin Gishu counties.PesaCheck, together with the International Budget Partnership, has researched this issue and finds this claim to be false. From the financial year 2013/14 to 2016/17, the Senate allocated Kiambu County a total of Sh30.021 billion in bothequitable share and conditional grants.Total allocations for Kiambu County 2013&ndash;2017During the same period, Uasin Gishu county was allocated Sh19.864 billion.Total allocations to Uasin Gishu County 2013&ndash;2017The total revenue allocations made to both Kiambu and Uasin Gishu counties is therefore Sh49.885 billion, compared to the Sh39.430 billion Turkana county was allocated during the same period.Total allocations to Turkana County 2013&ndash;2017The table below shows the revenue disbursements made by the National Treasury to Kiambu, Uasin Gishu, and Turkana Counties in billions of Kenya Shillings. PesaCheck obtained the figures for the financial year 2013/14, 2014/15 and 2015/16 from the National Treasury&rsquo;sreport on fiscal transfers to the counties.The 2016/17 figures are from agazette notice on fiscal transfers toKiambu,Uasin Gishu andTurkana counties between July 1 and December 30, 2016. Allocations for Kiambu and Uasin Gishu Counties vs. Turkana countyThe amount the National Treasury has actually disbursed to Kiambu and Uasin Gishu counties is Sh39.996 billion. This amount exceeds by Sh7.656 billion the actual disbursments to Turkana County, which is Sh32.340 billion.Whether the President was referring to revenues allocated or the received revenue (disbursed revenue), his claim that Turkana county has received more revenue than both Kiambu and Uasin Gishu counties does not add up and we find it to be FALSE.
