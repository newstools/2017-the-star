Few Siaya MCAs on Tuesday attended the assembly&rsquo;s first sitting after the nominations, with the majority being nominated members who did not run for other posts.This forced the speaker to adjourn the sitting just after 10 minutes.The House had adjourned a few days to the nominations and resumed sittings on Tuesday.Almost half of the elected MCAs were floored in the primaries.Some MCAs, who have received their nomination certificates, said their colleagues who lost in the primaries are frustrated.They added that even those who won but were aligned to governor hopeful Nicholas Gumbo and Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo have not been given their certificates.The MCAs spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of victimisation.
