Ferry services at the Mtongwe Channel Crossing resumed yesterday after the KFS repaired a pontoon for Sh13 million.The pontoon was washed away by the Indian Ocean waves a month ago.Kenya Ferry Services managing director Bakari Gowa said engineers fixed two damaged pillars holding the pontoon. He said Mtongwe people will no longer be rerouted to the busy Likoni Channel. &ldquo;The island jetty has been repaired and the residents will use the Mtongwe jetty near Bandari College from today (yesterday) to ease congestion at the Likoni Channel and improve efficiency,&rdquo; Gowa said.There are plans to expand both channels to accommodate more users.The Mtongwe Channel will be expanded to accommodate vehicles, but at the moment, it will only serve commuters.The government has allocated Sh2 billion to buy two ferries from Turkey by July.
