NASA National Campaign Committee chairman Musalia Mudavadi has said the opposition has conquered some of the key swing counties.Speaking during an interview on KTN on Monday night, Mudavadi said Kisii, Nyamira, Narok, Bomet, Trans Nzoia, Turkana, Kajiado and Samburu counties are now fully NASA.&ldquo;We have turned some key assumed swing and battleground counties into NASA blocs. We&rsquo;re now waging and clawing at Jubilee strongholds of Nakuru, West Pokot, Uasin Gishu, Tharaka Niithi, Meru and even Kiambu to turn them into battlegrounds swing counties,&rdquo; he said.Mudavadi said unveiling NASA has dramatically changed the 2013 vote equation since the opposition now has the Coast, Western, Upper Eastern and Nyanza blocs intact.&ldquo;The 10 Million Strong is a fact, not a fantasy, like Jubilee&rsquo;s 70 per cent plus one. Going by the public reception of our introductory recent rallies, Jubilee is struggling and we&rsquo;re on a roller coaster,&rdquo; he said. The former deputy Prime Minister said the IEBC needs to earn Kenyans&rsquo; confidence based on how it manages the August polls.&ldquo;The commission is putting on a brave face amid too much secrecy and opaqueness and public relation exercises to meet law requirements,&rdquo; Mudavadi said.
