NASA presidential flagbearer Raila Odinga has accused former Devolutin CS Anne Waiguru of refusing to respond to queries that will enable him defend himself in a defamation suit.In a response filed at the High Court in Milimani yesterday, Raila said Waiguru has refused to respond to lifestyle queries. He wants the suit dismissed.Waiguru said Raila is on a &ldquo;fishing expedition&rdquo;. She said Raila is being unreasonable, irrelevant and is using delaying tactics to stall the suit.Waiguru said the 15 questions posed do not relate to the issues raised in the suit. Among the questions she has refused to answer include her basic salary between 2006 and November 2015.Raila wants Waiguru to state the allowances she earned monthly, give a list of property she owns &ndash; including houses and cars &ndash; and say what type and how much they are worth.He wants to know whether Waiguru traded in the Nairobi Stock Exchange while she was a CS, and how much her shares were worth.Raila also seeks a list of Waiguru&rsquo;s dependents and how much she spends on each of them. He said Waiguru&rsquo;s failure to reveal the &ldquo;crucial&rdquo; information will deny him a fair trial.Raila said Waiguru has a duty to answer the questions as ordered by the court, failing which she ought to be deemed to have willfully disobeyed the order.Waiguru said some of the questions relate to her children and other details that are not among issues in court.&ldquo;Information sought is malicious and threatens to unnecessarily violate the privacy of minors who are not party to this suit,&rdquo; she said.Waiguru sued Raila on September 29, 2015, saying he had &ldquo;recklessly tarnished&rdquo; her name in an address to the press at his office on July 17, 2015.She wants Raila found liable, saying his assertions that she was aware of the NYS theft meant she used her position to engage in corruption.&ldquo;He portrayed me as a woman of low moral standing who is involved in unethical and professional misconduct,&rdquo; Waiguru said.Last year, Raila told the court he wants President Uhuru Kenyatta to testify as his key witness against Waiguru. He said Uhuru&rsquo;s testimony is necessary to determine the real issues.But Uhuru is unlikely to show up as he enjoys immunity against civil proceedings.
