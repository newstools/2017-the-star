Police officers have been urged to behave ethically in their duties to win public confidence. Athi River police chief Peter Kiema said a combination of work ethic and National Police Service functions have earned him and the police station Ipoa awards twice. “When you join the two, you will render the best services to wananchi,” Kiema said in his office yesterday. He said the public needs to be served in police stations with dignity and without discrimination. “Ensure all enjoy their constitutional rights,” he said. Kiema condemned officers who conduct malicious prosecutions of innocent citizens. He said the station relates well with the public through public barazas, groups and stakeholders’ meetings through community policing.
