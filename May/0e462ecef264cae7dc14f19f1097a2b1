Wiper candidate for the Kitui woman rep Irene Kasalu&rsquo;s (pictured) foremost agenda once elected will be to push for a substantive affirmative action kitty.&ldquo;It is not fair to have the woman rep get Sh7 million while other MPs are allocated up to Sh100 million. I will seek to correct that glaring imbalance,&rdquo; Kasalu said.She spoke to reporters yesterday at the Kitui Kefri Centre, moments after she was cleared to stand by county returning officer Gogo Nguma. She said the affirmative action kitty was meant to empower poor women and youth.&ldquo;The work of a woman rep in empowering women and youth is inhibited by the insufficient kitty. Proper funding is necessary to solve water shortage problems, improve the standards of education,&rdquo; she said.Kasalu also joined Enoch Wambua (Wiper), Elijah Kilonzi (Chama cha Uzalendo) and Stephen Kilonzo (Maendeleo Chap Chap) in calling for peaceful campaigns. They were also cleared by Gogo to run for the Senate.
