Nyeri leaders yesterday described as self-seekers the disgruntled Mount Kenya aspirants who joined NASA over unfair Jubilee nominations. Led by politician Wachira Keen, they said such hopefuls have no influence, hence cannot tilt the political scale in favour of NASA. “They are self-seekers out to fill their own stomachs just like a few others before them, whose support for ODM leader Raila Odinga didn’t translate into any votes from Mt Kenya,” Keen said. On Wednesday, some JP losers called a press conference to announce their defection from JP. But Keen, the Athi Water Services Board chairman, faulted their decision and added they are failed politicians, who cannot win even an MCA seat. “The fact that they performed dismally in the Jubilee primaries shows their unpopularity in their home areas,” Keen said in Nyeri town. “They cannot sway votes to NASA. They allege unfair nominations in Jubilee and you wonder how they view the most chaotic and failed nominations in NASA.” He said Nyeri and Mount Kenya residents and their leaders support President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto. Keen told the disgruntled leaders to accept the outcome of the primaries, saying JP had the most credible exercise. He said, “They should desist from apportioning blame on others for their failed bids.”
