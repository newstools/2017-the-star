Paris Marathon winner Paul Lonyangata was picked as the reserve runner.The team was arrived at following a meeting of top Athletics Kenya officials and coaches at Riadha House yesterday as they sought to avoid further embarrassment following previous withdrawals.Olympic marathon champion Eliud Kipchoge and former world marathon record holder Wilson Kipsang withdrew from the previously announced men&rsquo;s line up while women&rsquo;s world marathon record holder and London Marathon champion Mary Keitany and Chicago Marathon champion Florence Kiplagat turned down their chances in the women&rsquo;s team.Kiprop expressed her gratitude for the consideration and observed that she is ready to represent Kenya for the second time at the global championships.&ldquo;I am very happy for the selection and my target is to ensure I get a medal in London,&rdquo; she said. She is fresh from finishing third at the Bangalore 10km race in India.&ldquo;My form is good and I have started my preparations for the season. I competed in India just to test my endurance and speed and I am impressed,&rdquo; she added.AK vice president in charge of competitions, Paul Mutwii, said the team is the strongest they have at their disposal following the earlier withdrawals. &ldquo;Kipchoge and Kipsang expressed their wish to attempt breaking the world record at the Berlin Marathon while the others said they are nursing injuries and they do not want to gamble,&rdquo; said Mutwii.&ldquo;We also had others who said they are just from running marathons and feel it would be hurried for them to commit into the team.&rdquo;&ldquo;The team we have is good. There are non-championship runners in the team who have been running big city marathons and performing well and we feel they can replicate the same in London.&rdquo;The team will report to camp at Naiberi Camp Site, Kaptagat on June 4 and commence training the following day.
