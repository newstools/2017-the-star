Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga was on Friday booed and jeered by West Ugenya residents for allegedly belittling their MCA nominee.The governor had claimed nominee Andericus Odongo is not &ldquo;sharp&rdquo; like Stephen Kadera, who was knocked out in the primaries.Rasanga was forced to withdraw his statements as angry residents demanded an apology from him.Trouble started when the governor was invited to address the gathering at the Ratado chief&rsquo;s camp by one of his aides, Augustine Omondi, alias Makamu wa Makamu.Things got out of control when he faulted residents for voting out county assembly deputy speaker Kadera and replacing him with Odongo.&ldquo;Kadera is my friend whom we have worked with well, but this one you have elected is not as sharp,&rdquo; Rasanga said.The crowd booed him in disapproval.Rasanga apologised, saying it was a slip of the tongue.
