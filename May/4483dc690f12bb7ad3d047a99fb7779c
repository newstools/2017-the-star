I remember throwing my hands all over in despair and had to be restrained because I wasn&rsquo;t aware of what I was doing. Over and over again, I would ask God why me? Babe, I was inconsolable. I cried for four hours nonstop. I felt totally helpless and told God if He wanted to kill us all, it was alright. Despite my anguish, God never abandoned me. He sent me human angels who stood with me.&rdquo;
