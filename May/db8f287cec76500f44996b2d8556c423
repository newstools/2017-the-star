The Kenya Revenue Authority was yesterday given seven days to probe more than 1,300 Customs agents operating without valid licences.Justice Roseline Aburili told the taxman to complete investigations and hand in a report in court by May 22.Although justice Aburili declined to issue orders in the suit filed against the taxman by the Kenya International Freight and Warehousing Association, she accused the KRA of taking too long to solve the matter.&ldquo;We cannot do without importation, something has to be done. We don&rsquo;t have food on our shelves. There&rsquo;s no big dispute here, just delay,&rdquo; Aburili said.The agents wanted the judge to intervene, saying they are suffering losses. They accused the KRA of refusing to renew their 2017 licences, despite complying with the required renewal obligations.Through Maanzo and Company Advocates, the association, alongside directors of 14 other clearing and forwarding companies, said KRA&rsquo;s action has blocked them from participating in lucrative tenders.&ldquo;Their action has put our business at risk,&rdquo; said William Ojonyo in an affidavit.But the KRA said it is in the process of renewing the licences and is investigating the companies to establish their status. &ldquo;There is a vetting process currently going on and all we are asking is a little more time. The orders being sought are to extend the licences for a whole year and granting the same will affect investigations,&rdquo; the KRA said.
