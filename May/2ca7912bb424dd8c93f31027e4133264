Health services in Nyeri county were paralysed yesterday after nurses went on a go-slow over promotions and shortage of staff. The nurses issued a strike notice on April 6, demanding that the county promote them and hire 400 more nurses.Kenya National Union of Nurses Nyeri branch secretary Beatrice Nduati said the county government &ldquo;has been dilly-dallying in hiring more nurses, despite numerous appeals&rdquo;. She said the county has not hired more staff or made promotions for the last four years. Nduati said they are overworked and demoralised. Nyeri County Referral Hospital was one of the hard-hit facilities. Patients were transferring to private hospitals. In health centres, tens of patients were turned away as no staff could give them care. The officials later stormed Governor Samuel Wamathai&rsquo;s (pictured) offices, demanding audience. He was not in.
