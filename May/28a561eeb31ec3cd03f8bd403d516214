It&rsquo;s pouring rain. The ground is shifting, cracks are opening, water is pouring from fissures, housing are collapsing and a catastrophic landslide and cave-ins are feared.That&rsquo;s the grim situation in Kirembu village in Mathioya, Murang&rsquo;a county.Villagers are living in fear of the earth opening and landslides as heavy rains fall.About 36 homesteads are undermined and many houses have collapsed because of cracks opening beneath them.Resident Nancy Gakure yesterday said she heard a noise outside a few days ago and when she went to check, she found large cracks in the ground.They have spread under her house and streams of water are flowing from them.&ldquo;These cracks are very deep, which scares us,&rdquo; Gakure said. The whole village is afraid the area may be swept away by a landslide. They are unable to sleep at night.&ldquo;We are wondering what will happen as rains get heavier and the cracks get deeper and wider,&rdquo; Gakure said.Residents don&rsquo;t know where the water is flowing. They tried to measure the depth of the cracks by putting logs in them. They were shocked when they all disappeared into the earth.Gitugi chief Lucy Irungu has urged families to move.&ldquo;There is imminent danger and we ask them to vacate until rains subside,&rdquo; she said. The residents said they have nowhere to go and asked the government for financial aid.&ldquo;We are waiting for help from the government and God as we have nowhere to go,&rdquo; Gakure said.This is the second county village to develop cracks since 2013. The first was Kirikoini in Kangema subcounty.Villagers were forced to vacate until the rains ended. In 2015, Nema recommended the government repossess the unstable land, seal it off and plant trees.
