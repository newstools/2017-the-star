The government is set to roll out the new curriculum in a pilot programme that will be implemented in both private and public schools.Parliamentary Education Committee chairperson Sabina Chege has said the new curriculum will improve the quality of learning and boost professionalism in the workforce.She urged stakeholders to support the implementation.Three schools in each county, she said, have been selected for the pilot programme. The programme will later be extended to other schools.&ldquo;We are hoping the whole education sector will have changed into the new education system by 2021,&rdquo; Chege said.She said the new system will help address the many challenges faced in the sector.&ldquo;The new syllabus will focus more on enhancing students&rsquo; skills and giving students an opportunity to explore their talents,&rdquo; Chege said.This, she said, will improve the economic development of the country as it will encourage learners to venture more into establishing businesses rather than relying on employment.
