"I will not lie to Kenyans...by the end of last year, I had spent about Sh20 million."While conceding defeat, Mwaura described his bid for a high level political office as a debut for a youthful aspirant living with albinism."This has its own challenges. It is never easy but someone had to do it. Someone had to be the first to pay the price and create a pathway of possibilities," he said.Mwaura's campaigns were not without chaos. Pictures posted on Facebook last week showed the MP with a bruised left ear and the windows of his four-wheel drive car shattered.Some reports indicated he suffered a gunshot wound but Ruiru OCPD Isaac Thuranira dismissed the claims saying nobody used guns during the fracas.More on this: MP Mwaura injured during fracas with rival camp in GithuraiAlso read: Mwaura discharged from hospital after 'assassination' claimsIt was reported on April 7 that President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s Jubilee Party had received Sh715.8 million nomination fees from aspirants ranging from MCA to governor hopefuls.This was in addition to the Sh150 million the party made from selling membership cards that were initially to be used for nominations.The party has one presidential aspirant, 106 for governor, 161 for senator, 171 woman representative hopefuls, 1,006 for MP and 6,568 for ward representative.The figure was the total of what hopefuls for the positions paid.
