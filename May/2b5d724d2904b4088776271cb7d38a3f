As the leadership of the CoG changed yesterday, governors raised concerns about the reluctance by both the National Assembly and the Senate to pass the Division of Revenue Bill 2017-18.Council of Governors chairman Peter Munya handed over leadership to Governor Josphat Nanok (Turkana). Vice chairman John Mruttu (Taita Taveta) will continue serving while William Kabogo (Kiambu) was elected the whip. The leaders will serve as interim officials before the August 8 polls.During the release of the Report on the State of Devolution, the governors said they fear delayed approval of the bill could lead to a chaotic transition as the country heads to the General Election.The revenue bill was placed in limbo after the mediation committee failed to agree.The National Assembly had proposed the counties receive Sh323 billion, but the Senate increased the allocation to Sh352 billion. The National Assembly rejected the Sh29 billion increase.The National Assembly went ahead to pass the Appropriations Bill, which allows for expenditure at the national level, despite the Division of Revenue Bill being at the mediation stage over the Sh29 billion increment.In what complicated matters further, President Uhuru Kenyatta assented to the Appropriations Bill, 2017, giving authority to the Treasury to start drawing its share of the revenue from the national coffers, while the counties remain stranded.Munya said the standoff between the two houses could paralyse the approval of county budgets.&ldquo;The counties need to prepare their budgets and that is only possible if they know the amount of money allocated to them,&rdquo; Munya said.He continued, &ldquo;We might not have the county governments if the National Assembly does not take action on this issue.&rdquo;Munya said the Sh29 billion addition proposed by the Senate was crucial in the dispatch of the governors&rsquo; mandate.He challenged the Office of the Attorney General over its advisory role to the county governments, adding it was only mandated to provide legal advice to the national government.
