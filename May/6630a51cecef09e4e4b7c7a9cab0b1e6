Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago wants his rivals who lost in the Jubilee Party primary to back him for a second term so he so can fulfil his remaining pledges.Mandago and Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi have also claimed that youths from Naivasha, Nakuru and Nyahururu have been illegally moved to Eldoret to interfere with the August 8 polls.Uasin Gishu county commissioner Abdi Hassan said police are investigating the claims.Mandago said, &ldquo;We have asked police to ensure that all strangers who have been brought here are investigated and dealt with.&rdquo;Sudi said some MCAs are behind plans to incite residents. Mandago said, &ldquo;People must stop arrogance and threats that will not work. They have been spreading propaganda that I don&rsquo;t like certain people.&rdquo;But the two MCAs accused Mandago of dividing Uasin Gishu residents along tribal lines in a manner that will embarrass DP William Ruto, who is from the region.He said he will unite residents, including those who did not back him during the primaries.Don&rsquo;t waste time, join meThe governor added that the primaries were free and fair and those still complaining should simply give up and accept the will of the people.Mandago spoke on Friday last week when he was handed the JP nomination certificate to defend his seat.&ldquo;Wale bado wanacheza lukumbalukumba huku waache na wajiunge nami (Those still dancing here and there should stop wasting time and join me),&rdquo; he said.In the party election, Mandago defeated businessman Bundotich Kiprop, popularly known as Buzeki, Dr Edward Serem, Charles Kigen and Felix Butit.Buzeki rejected the nomination results and said he will run for governor as an independent.He dismissed reports he is under pressure to withdraw from the race.Buzeki has insisted that the primaries were rigged and rejected reports that he has been pressured by Ruto to back Mandago.Analysts say Buzeki has a huge war chest and can give Mandago a run for his money.
