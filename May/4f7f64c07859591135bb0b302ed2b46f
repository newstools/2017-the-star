This season, Mo&euml;t &amp; Chandon celebrates THE NOW and proudly introduces a new lifestyle campaign around its bold and generous Mo&euml;t Nectar Imperial, soon to be officially launched in Kenya.The aim is to celebrate living in the now, achievements and milestones, as they happen, bearing in mind that a year races past in the blink of an eye, and taking the time to stop, acknowledge and celebrate is the essence of true luxury.The campaign is composed of four exclusive visuals captured by Italian photographer Giampaolo Sgura.
