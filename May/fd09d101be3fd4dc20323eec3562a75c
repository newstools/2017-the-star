Strathmore University surrendered a first half lead to play to a 1-all draw against Amira Sailors during the Kenya Hockey Union women&rsquo;s Premier League match at the City Park Stadium yesterday.The result denied the students a chance to move second on league log and probably close in on their perennial rivals Telkom Orange.Strathmore are currently fourth with seven points from four matches while Orange hold a comfortable lead with 18 points from six matches unbeaten.The students took a first half lead through Elizabeth Ngombo, who tapped a Diana Awino&rsquo;s penalty corner in the 23rd minute. The last season runners up seemed set for a win as they guarded their lead, going into the breather.Efforts by Sailors to level the scores in the second half hit the rock bottom as Strathmore mounted a solid defence to safeguard their lead. However, an error by the same defence allowed Sailors to restore parity through Pauline Naise, who scored from the spot after the umpire awarded a flick-kick in the 59th minute.Speaking after the match, Strathmore&rsquo;s stand-in coach Fred Oracha said, &ldquo;We were better side today compared to last time and a point from Sailors is better than none. We were both affected by the state of the turf and I am happy with my girls as they adapted faster. They played according to instructions and I think it was just by bad luck that we conceded a flick in the dying minutes.&rdquo;His Sailors counterpart, Linet Odhiambo said: &ldquo;The game was good. We played well not withstanding the bad state of the pitch and I am sure we will bounce back with a win.&rdquo; Meanwhile, inspirational Victor Osiche scored a brace to help Greensharks win 2-0 against Parklands Sports Club in the KHU men&rsquo;s Premier League at the same venue.Osiche scored in the 16th and 54th minute respectively to help the side, coached by Ben Owaga bag three points. They are now placed second on the standings with 17 points&mdash;one adrift of leaders Kenya Police.
