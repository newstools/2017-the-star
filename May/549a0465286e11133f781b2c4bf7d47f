Recently, celebrated pastors Allan and Kathy Kiuna were in the US to spread the gospel. But it seems their visit was not only about church assignments but also matters pertaining family.Well, Dad, as he is commonly referred to by his overzealous followers, posted a photo of Mum, his wife Kathy, his second daughter Stephanie and an unidentified white man and captioned it:"Just grateful to God for a wonderful family! Am so blessed. Words fail me just say how grateful I am to God for this gifts in my life. Love you."Bishop Allan accompanied the post with the pic below that has left Kenyans with more questions than answers."Madam Kiuna ..could that guy be your son in law to be? You all look dope," one of his followers posed a question.Could he be the man who is set to marry Stephanie Kiuna? Harusi tunayo hatuna?
