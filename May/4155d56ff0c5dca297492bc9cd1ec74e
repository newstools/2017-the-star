The CJ yesterday got a feel of the hardship Mombasa court users experience. Court rooms lack air conditioners despite the high temperatures at the Coast. Judges, magistrates and at least 1,500 users have to deal with this on a daily basis. David Maraga said the courts are in a horrible state and need an urgent upgrade. &ldquo;Some of these systems were put up in 1980 and they have never been repaired. I must say the working conditions are not pleasing,&rdquo; he said. Maraga added that they will expand the Shanzu court and make it a full-fledged law court. He said the Shimo la Tewa Prison has given more land to the Judiciary to put up a modern court. The Shanzu court, which mostly handles terror-related cases, has been named a &ldquo;cage&rdquo; due to the steel bars separating the suspects from other court users. Two more courts will be constructed in Changamwe and Likoni. More judges and magistrates will be deployed.
