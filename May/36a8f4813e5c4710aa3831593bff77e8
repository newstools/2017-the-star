Fifty-year-old Habiba Hudhow earns a living from selling camel meat known as nyirinyiri at Orahey market in Wajir town.Nyirinyiri, in the Somali language, is meat cut into strips and left in the sun to dry. It is later cut into cubes and fried with local herbs which preserve it for a long period.Wajir South livestock production officer Julius Mwangi says nyirinyiri is a Somali delicacy that is in high demand, and if well-preserved can stay fresh between one and eight months.Hudhow buys the meat from butcheries at Wajir shopping centre each morning. She says she wakes up at dawn to get the specific steak. &ldquo;My customers insist on quality, so I have to get the best meat,&rdquo; Hudhow said.&ldquo;I have to choose camel steak meat which is the best for the processing of &lsquo;Nyirinyiri&rsquo; and it retails at Sh400 per kilo.&rdquo; Hudhow, who belongs to a group of women who prepare the meat, said they transport it to Nairobi twice a week, and most customers are in Eastleigh. A kilo fetches about Sh1,200.Agriculture executive Yusuf Gedi says nyirinyiri is an intervention in food security, promotes culture, and is a source of income for pastoral women. He said hard economic times forced all Somali women to learn how to make nyirinyiri.Hudhow used to make nyirinyiri using traditional methods, but that changed when a non-governmental organisation, Oxfam, introduced advanced technology to process the meat. &ldquo;Making nyirinyiri requires high standards of cleanliness and a lengthy preparation process ,&rdquo; says Hudhow.&ldquo;We get orders; some for weddings in Nairobi and even Tanzania,&rdquo; said Fatuma Osman, a group member.
