Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has hit out at Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka for nominating his son for the EALA slot.Speaking at the Machakos People's Park on Saturday when he hosted about 10, 000 leaders from the region, Mutua termed the move as a show of selfish leadership."It is a shame that the Wiper leader is even pushing for his son to be nominated for the EALA post. These shows that they care very little about the rest of the people&rdquo;, said Mutua.Read; Storm in NASA as Kalonzo son, Oburu nominated to EALAHe laughed off the current wrangles within the Wiper party saying it is headed for a big fall."You have seen some of its top leaders including Senators Johnson Muthama and David Musila bolting out of the party. It shows the party's fortunes are dwindling," Mutua said.He said Wiper had its time in the Ukambani region but the political wave now belongs to Maendeleo Chap Chap party.Mutua said his move to form the party was driven by the desire to offer people driven leadership.MPs Vincent Musyoka (Mwala ), Robert Mutemi (nominated) and hundreds of party aspirants were also present.Mutua who will defend his seat on a Chap Chap party ticket urged Wiper party to brace for a bruising duel in Ukambani."A fish starts rotting from the head.Wiper leadership is rotten and that's why it cannot get aspirants in many parts of Ukambani. Its leaders cannot even agree on whom to run for the seat of governor in some counties&rdquo;, Mutua said.Opinion leaders present urged the governor to seek the Presidency come 2022.The leaders drawn from Machakos, Makueni, Kitui, Kwale and Taita Taveta counties also endorsed Mutua as the spokesperson of the Kamba nation."We as a community are tired of occupying position two in the leadership pecking order in previous governments. Mutua is our best bet for the presidency come 2022," said former Machakos Mayor Timothy Kilonzo.Mzee Mailu from Makueni said Mutua was capable of taking over when President Uhuru Kenyatta's term ends in 2022.The meeting was also attended by the Kamba Council of Elders to bless Mutua where they also gifted him a bow and a quiver of arrows.Read; Muthama quits Machakos senator race, accuses Kalonzo of mismanaging Wiper
