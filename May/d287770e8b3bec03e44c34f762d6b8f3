Ndeiya MCA Nelson Munga has urged parties to come up with strategies to conduct free and fair primaries to avoid chaos and instances where aspirants hold grudges.He lost during the Jubilee primaries to businessman Gideon Gachara. Munga said he will accept the IEBC results on August 8.He said some aspirants could avoid joining big parties with presidential candidates - no matter how powerful they are - to avoid frustrations.Munga said a lot of aspirants who sough tickets during the Jubilee Party primaries defected and opted to run as independents because &ldquo;they were frustrated&rdquo;.&ldquo;It is frustrating to see aspirants complain about how the best party in the country conducted its primaries. Their leaving the party shows they didn&rsquo;t have faith in JP&rsquo;s management. We need to clean up and allow people to support partys that have faith in them&rdquo; he said.Speaking in Limuru town on Saturday, Munga said the aspirants who lost in the JP primaries decided to run as independents because &ldquo;they want to ensure their supporters do not get frustrated and refuse to come out to vote.&rdquo;He said voter apathy is serious and could cost President Uhuru Kenyatta the presidency.
