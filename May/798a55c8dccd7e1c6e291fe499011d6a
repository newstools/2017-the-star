There is no development that can be achieved if our children remain illiterate,&rdquo; he said at Mariakani Secondary School.Kambi&rsquo;s close allies have told the Star the governor hopeful has been impressed with Mvurya&rsquo;s education model in Kwale and wants to replicate it in Kilifi.Mvurya has been paying secondary and university fees for qualified students from Kwale using county funds.&ldquo;If Mvurya can do it, why can&rsquo;t we do it in Kilifi?&rdquo; Kambi said.&ldquo;Your work will be to give birth. Mine will be to educate your children,&rdquo; he told Kilifi parents.The former Kaloleni MP will be contesting against incumbent Amason Kingi (ODM) and Jubilee&rsquo;s Gideon Mung&rsquo;aro.Kingi is riding on his development record to retain his seat, while Mung&rsquo;aro has been battling the corruption menace in the county and also says he will ensure sufficient water supply.Kilifi is perennially affected by drought and famine.No more water shortageKambi said he will make the county water-sufficient by harvesting rainwater and building a dam on the River Galana.The dam, he says, will help produce hydropower and be used for irrigation programmes.&ldquo;They say our people are lazy. Our people are not lazy. They farm but there is insufficient rain. That is why we will come up with irrigation projects to beat the drought,&rdquo; Kambi said.He said he will work with the national government to ensure the county does not lag behind in development.&ldquo;If Uhuru will be President I will work with him. If it is Raila who will be President, I will work with him.&ldquo;You cannot work in isolation and expect to develop at the same rate as other counties working with the national government. You cannot abuse the President who is elected by millions of Kenyans,&rdquo; Kambi said.He was referring to Kingi&rsquo;s frequent attacks on President Uhuru.Kambi said Kadu Asili is the only party that can pull Kilifi residents from the jaws of poverty because it is made up of people who have been at the Coast and have the best interests of residents at heart.
