Meru Senator Kiraitu Murungi has said he will not support any woman representative aspirant.He said if elected governor, he is ready to work with whoever wins. Kiraitu spoke during an interview on a vernacular radio station on Monday. Incumbent Florence Kajuju and Kawira Mwangaza are seeking the seat.Kiraitu said, &ldquo;They should stop dragging my name into their battles. I will not attend their meetings or mention them anywhere because they are tarnishing my name.&rdquo;Initially, Kiraitu was seen to support Kajuju. Kiraitu, Kajuju and Igembe South MP Mithika Linturi had formed the Kikali alliance - an acronym of their names.However, matters changed weeks to the Jubilee Party primaries when Mwangaza decamped from Meru Governor Peter Munya&rsquo;s PNU and joined Jubilee. She was received by Deputy President William Ruto.Mwangaza lost the JP primaries to Kajuju. Analysts say Mwangaza lost support after leaving PNU. Munya had urged the Water executive to shelve her ambitions in favour of Mwangaza.The analysts say Mwangaza is now treading on dangerous ground and may end up losing more supporters if she quits Jubilee as well.Last week, Munya said he warned Mwangaza against decamping, but she would hear none of it.He said he suspected the primaries would be unfair.Munya said Mwangaza has learnt her lesson the hard way.Kajuju garnered 131,349 votes against Mwangaza&rsquo;s 119,246.Mwangaza protested, saying the results were unfair.&ldquo;We went round many polling stations and the number of votes exceeded the number of registered voters,&rdquo; she said.Mwangaza, who owns Baite TV, has said she will run as an independent candidate.
