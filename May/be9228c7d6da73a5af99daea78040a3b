Ndhiwa MP nominee Martin Owino (ODM) has urged incumbent Agostinho Neto to support his bid.Owino said he has lost the seat twice to Neto and supported him afterwards, and the incumbent should reciprocate.Neto&rsquo;s support would ensure residents turn out in large numbers to vote for NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga, he said.&ldquo;If we walk together then Ndhiwa residents will be sure of peace and back my candidature. There is a Kiswahili saying that whoever does not accept the victory of another cannot win,&rdquo; Owino said.He spoke on Sunday in Ndhiwa town during a thanksgiving rally.Owino urged his rivals, who lost in the primaries, to support him. They are Michael Agwanda, Joshua Orero and Johnson Oduru.Yesterday, Neto told the Star on the phone that Owino did not win fairly.He said he will be on the ballot papers on August 8.
