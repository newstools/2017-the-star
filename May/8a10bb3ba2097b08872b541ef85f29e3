NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga (pictured) yesterday denied as &rdquo;propaganda&rdquo; claims he plans to evict settlers from the Mau Forest if he wins the election.Speaking on a Kalenjin vernacular radio station, he said he has no intentions of punishing the Rift Valley residents.Raila said the 2008 eviction from the forest was a Cabinet decision aimed at protecting water sources.He said the region is a known water source, but evictees should be resettled.On Friday last week, the African Court on Human and People&rsquo;s Rights said Kenya was violating the land rights of the forest-dwelling Ogiek people.Answering questions from charged callers on the radio, Raila accused the Jubilee government of neglecting evictees, saying they are still in IDP camps.&ldquo;These guys have neglected evictees. During their campaigns, they claim they would resettle them within 100 days when they assume power,&rdquo; he said.He said, however, no one should be allowed to engage in illegal logging in the water catchment area.The ODM leader said he did not individually oppose Sh38 billion Itare Dam in Kuresoi North. He said he was approached by elders who filed a petition at the High Court in Nakuru, asking him to get them a lawyer to follow the case.Early this month, Mau evictees in Narok South said they will support NASA. They said the Jubilee administration has failed to resettle them and has lied to them. They defended Raila against claims he was responsible for their evictions in 2009 when he was PM .
