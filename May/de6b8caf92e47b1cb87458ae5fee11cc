Nineteen out of 26 Kitui Wiper MCAs are unlikely to savour the glamour, comfort and beauty of a new assembly chamber after they lost to newcomers in the party primaries.It is unclear how many of them have opted to go independent.It has emerged that the biggest casualties of the Wiper nominations were majority leader Jacob Maundu and deputy speaker Ndemwa Mbiti.In a cruel twist of fate, the losers have a minimal chance of returning to the assembly, given that Wiper enjoys significant support in the region. And this despite having played a critical role in the construction of the multimillion-shilling ultra-modern facility.The MCAs appeared to have fallen victim to the intense war between then-Wiper big guns Kitui Governor Julius Malombe and Senator David Musila.The two camps were at daggers drawn throughout the lead-up to the primaries, each trying to outdo the other as they wooed voters for support.Attempts to have them build consensus to avert a fallout were unsuccessful, and, with this, the ward representatives fell by the wayside. Musila ditched the party, of which he was chairman, after losing to Malombe in the governor race. He will run as an independent. Five Wiper MCAs survived the purge as voters cracked down on their colleagues. They are Finance committee chairman Antony Muthui (Matinyani), Jackson Mwanduka (Mutomo Kibwea), assembly chief whip Alex Munyoki (Mulango), Daniel Ngoina (Kitui Township) and Benard Munyasya (Mwingi Township).They are almost assured of returning to the assembly if residents&rsquo; loyalty to Wiper is anything to go by. However, another two &mdash; Stephen Kithuka (Mutonguni) and Muryungi Ikunga (Tharaka) &mdash; were not subjected to the nominations. They ditched Wiper for the friendly Muungano Party.
