The government is planning to construct more than 221 kilometers of road in the six coastal counties at a cost of Sh102 billion.Infrastructure Principal Secretary John Mosonik said the money will be used to tarmac three major road projects in the region.&ldquo;The projects will be completed in the next two years,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.Mosonik told journalists in Malindi on Saturday that work on the 119 kilometer Garsen- Lamu road was progressing well.He said the construction of the 110km Malindi-Salagate roads and the Taveta-Mwatate roads was also on course.&ldquo;There is major progress in the rehabilitation and surface-dressing of Garsen-Hola-Bura-Garisa highway which had been neglected for long.Mosonik said the major road projects were geared towards spurring economic activities and uplifting the people's living standards.The Opposition and the ruling coalition have been fighting for votes at the Coast, one of their tactics being steering development or promising to do so.President Uhuru Kenyatta and Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho have clashed over development projects in the county.Joho was barred from attending the Mtongwe ferry services relaunch and the President warned him against following him everywhere.The two also disagreed on financial allocations to the county and quoted different figures.More on this: [AUDIO] Stop following me like I'm your wife, Uhuru tells Joho at Mtongwe ferry launchAlso read: Uhuru and Joho: Who is lying about Sh40 billion Mombasa allocation?The PS warned contractors against slow construction, especially of Garsen-Lamu road, which was behind schedule.Mosonik said they have set up two teams to work on the road to ensure it is finished quickly.One team will start from Witu to Garsen and the other from Mokowe to Witu, he said.The PS said Jubilee has reduced the cost of construction for a kilometer of road from Sh200 million to Sh36 million.But he noted Garsen-Mokowe road will cost Sh80 million per kilometer as it is high density.Mosonik said plans to upgrade Garsen-Mombasa road were at an advanced stage.He said the design was already out and that the government was sourcing funds.Mosonik was on a two-day tour inspection of projects including the 50 km Mariakani-Bamba and the Mavueni-Mariakani roads.The 35 km Sabaki-Marafa road is also being constructed.
