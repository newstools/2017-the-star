UDP presidential candidate Cyrus Jirongo (pictured) has told NASA and Jubilee to prepare for “fireworks” in Western and Nairobi. He said he decided to run for President because the Luhya community is neither in NASA nor in Jubilee. “Our people must know they are not regarded by either NASA or Jubilee. I’m going to give them a run for their money,” Jirongo said on Friday. “It’s disheartening that Luhyas in NASA have been promised non-existent positions, while those in Jubilee do not even know what their share is.” He presented his name to the IEBC after the collapse of talks between his party and NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga on how the two parties could work together. The former Lugari MP said he will hit the ground running, immediately he presents his nomination papers to the IEBC for clearance. Presidential candidates are supposed to present their papers to the commission between tomorrow and Monday. Raila will present his nomination papers to the commission on Sunday. NASA will hold its first campaign rally in Mumias town in Western on Saturday. Jirongo had earlier said he would not run for President if NASA named ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi the flagbearer. On Friday, Jirongo said Jubilee has not told the community what its share in government will be if it is reelected.
