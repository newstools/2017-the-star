Is someone intentionally digging up Nairobi&rsquo;s Jubilee governor candidate&rsquo;s past dirty linen?A letter has been circulating in social media indicating that a warrant of arrest has been issued by a Mombasa chief magistrate against Mike Sonko.The letter indicated that a warrants of arrest against him were still standing after police previously failed to effect them.Jubilee nominee for governorSonko won the primaries in a landslide, beating his opponent Peter Kenneth and giving him a clear path to run for the Nairobi top job.However, a senior court official at the Mombasa court has disputed the letter and said people have misinterpreted the letter.He said the letter was a response to a letter of inquiry by William Kenga Advocates, who wanted to know the availability of the case files and if he could access them.The court official said the registrar of criminal cases A. Abubakar, however, informed the law firm that they could not give them the files as they were untraceable due to the backlog.He said it was not easy to trace the files because the case took place years ago and they have been categorising the files.Were his court cases concluded?In court records, Sonko had previously faced four charges under different case files.He had been charged in case file number 196 of 1998, where he is accused of obtaining money by false pretences.He was also charged on case file number 630 of 1998, where he allegedly handled stolen property, forgery, stealing and obtaining goods fraudulently.However, the conclusion of the cases remain a mystery as they are not in the records.It is not clear whether the cases were concluded or, dismissed or the accused was acquitted.The records further revealed that a warrant of arrest against Sonko had been issued by resident magistrate Mugambi Babu.However, it is also not clear whether the warrant was effected or lifted.Two other cases 950 and 951 of 1997 were not on record.
