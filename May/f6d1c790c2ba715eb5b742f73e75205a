Starehe MP Maina Kamanda has accepted the decision by the Jubilee Party Appeals Tribunal that declared his rival, Charles Kanyi alias Jaguar, the winner in the parliamentary primaries.The lawmaker said he will not ditch JP and neither will he run as an independent candidate, but maintained the exercise was a sham and he won.&ldquo;I have been saying those who lose the nominations should not leave Jubilee for other parties. You have quoted me on many occasions advocating for that,&rdquo; Kamanda said.&ldquo;The party has made a decision. Being a key member of the party, I only urge my supporters to back whoever was nominated.&rdquo; On Wednesday, the Jubilee tribunal overturned Kamanda&rsquo;s victory following a successful petition by Jaguar.Constituency returning officer Charles Odero last week declared Kamanda the winner with 10, 374 votes against Jaguar&rsquo;s 8, 391.But the celebrated musician rejected the results, insisting he won.&ldquo;I want to commend JP for the way it handled this complaint and made the right decision. This is proof the youth have a chance in the party,&rdquo; Jaguar said after he was given the nominations certificate. Speaking to journalists at his Muthaiga home yesterday, Kamanda with his family accused JP secretary general Raphael Tuju of &ldquo;engineering&rdquo; his downfall.&ldquo;We need to be told if there&rsquo;s room for old people in the party. I won the nominations but someone else was given the certificate,&rdquo; he said.Kamanda, who has served as Starehe MP for 19 years, said non-party members were allowed to vote.&ldquo;We had an issue with the manner in which the party conducted the nominations. The party messed by allowing Nairobi people to vote with IDs. 50 per cent of those who voted in Nairobi were members of ODM,&rdquo; he said.
