Traders at the Buxton matatu stage in Mombasa barricaded roads in the area on Tuesday during protests over the destruction of their kiosks.They lit bonfires, disrupting traffic for at least two hours, before police arrived and dispersed them using teargas.The kiosks were pulled down by county askaris."We woke up to find our business premises destroyed. They have taken our goods," said Chongwai Githai. "The national and county governments should sit with us so we can discuss how to solve this issue. They have to give us alternative space."Omar Hamisi, a watchman hired by Munawar Shuttle, said the askaris demolished the kiosks at around 11.30pm on Monday."They beat me up despite my protests. They did not want to listen to me. We lost passengers&rsquo; parcels during the demolition. If the owners complain, the blame will be on the county askaris," he said.Munawar Shuttle director Mohammed Badawy told The Star that business was slow on Tuesday morning."Our shuttles usually take about five to 10 minutes to fill up. It has been two hours since the protests began yet the vehicles are not even half full," Badawy said.The county constructed 30 stalls at the Buxton stage for which the traders paid a one-off Sh30,000 deposit that was followed by monthly payments of Sh10,000.There are more than 300 traders in the area.Badawy said they had information the county wants to expand the bus stage.Trade CEC Tawfiq Balala was not immediately available for comment.County communications director Richard Chacha said they were held up in a meeting.Governor hopeful Suleiman Shahbal condemned the demolition saying it was heinous and lacked legal backing."Where does the county want them to go? Why couldn't they offer an alternative site where they would be settled upon the evictions?" he asked.
