Mike Sigei, who was the chief campaigner for Franklin Bett in the Kericho JP Senate race, yesterday told Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen to keep off Kericho politics.He blamed Bett&rsquo;s loss to incumbent Aaron Cheruiyot on Murkomen&rsquo;s interference, saying it is high time the senator confined his politics to his county.Sigei said Cheruiyot would not have beaten Bett if Murkomen did not compromise the primaries.&ldquo;Kericho, like Elgeyo Marakwet, has its own leaders who can plan on who to campaign for without Murkomen&rsquo;s input,&rdquo; he said.Meanwhile, four Kericho MPs who lost in the Jubilee nominations have resolved to defend their seats as independents.Eric Keter (Belgut), Benjamin Langat (Ainamoi), Leonard Sang (Bureti) and Jackson Rop (Kipkelion East) lost to newcomers, but dismissed the results, saying the exercise was marred by irregularities and terming it an abuse of democracy.Since losing in the nominations, they have been meeting with elders and the youth separately.MPs Justice Kemei (Sigowet-Soin) and Joseph Limo (Kipkelion East) survived voters&rsquo; onslaught. Unlike their colleagues, they said the primaries were free and fair. Keter lost to Nelson Koech Sonko, with Sang losing to Japheth Mutai.Silvanus Maritim won the nomination ticket for the Ainamoi seat. Incumbent Langat unsuccessfully ran for governor, which was won by incumbent Paul Chepkwony.He has rejoined the race for Ainamoi MP, saying he erred in joining the contest for the county top job.Hilary Koske Nyiganet defeated Rop.At the 2013 election, Keter won the Belgut seat on the Kanu ticket. He later defected to Jubilee Party.Keter has said he will campaign for President Uhuru and DP William Ruto&rsquo;s reelection.He expressed confidence that he will win on August 8, saying he has faith in the IEBC.
