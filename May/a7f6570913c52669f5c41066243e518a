More than 90 per cent of Jubilee MCAs lost in the party primaries in Nandi, Uasin Gishu, Elgeyo Marakwet and Trans Nzoia counties. Voters in Elgeyo Marakwet led the purge of MCAs, rejecting 15 out of the 17 Jubilee ward representatives. Only Sengwer MCA David Kipketer and Arror MCA Christopher Chemosong survived. “During the campaigns for the primaries, voters openly said they would not reelect their MCAs because of massive graft that was witnessed at the assembly in the last four years,” civil society representative Ben Kiptoo said. Wasteful foreign trips He said voters had constantly complained that MCAs had used a lot of resources on foreign trips and allowances while abandoning their roles at the assembly. Elgeyo Marakwet speaker Albert Kochei ran for Keiyo South MP and lost. In Uasin Gishu, only eight of 30 MCAs won in the primaries. Assembly speaker Isaac Terer lost his bid for Kesses MP. He was defeated by Mediheal Group of Hospitals CEO Dr Swarrup Mishra. Journalist wins party ticket In Nandi, only seven out of 30 MCAs survived in the primaries. Those who lost include majority leader Julius Menjo, who was defeated by former journalist Nancy Jemutai in Kobujoi ward. “I am happy that I have been given a chance to serve residents of Kobujoi at the assembly because I am confident that I will also carry the day come August 8,” Jemutai said. In Trans Nzoia, 10 out of the 38 MCAs won the primaries in their respective parties — Jubilee, Ford Kenya and New Ford Kenya. Two months ago, all the Trans Nzoia MCAs had been charged with abuse of office at a court in Eldoret town. They were rounded up by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission and taken to court for allegedly misusing public money on a funeral. Some of the MCAs said the case had affected their reelection bids, as voters were angry with them. The campaigns for the primaries were heated in most wards, most of which had more than 15 aspirants each.
