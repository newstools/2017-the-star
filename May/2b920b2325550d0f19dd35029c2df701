A Kisumu court has acquitted Kitutu Chache South MP Richard Onyonka of Sh 21 million tax evasion charges.He denied being part of conspiracy resulting in the non-payment of the money to Chemelil Sugar Company in 2008.The charge sheet stated that the money, which was used to buy the sugar from the factory, was from the CDF kitty.The prosecution had earlier told the court that Onyonka, with another suspect, failed to remit the cash to KRA following the purchase.Onyonka and the other person, the court heard, lied that the CDF had lawfully withheld the tax.The court was also told that Onyonka, using his position as the CDF patron, conferred the money to James Siro.This was by causing Chemelil Sugar to sell sugar purportedly to Kitutu Chache CDF at a price less Value Added Tax.The legislator was charged with the first count of conspiring to commit an offence involving an economic crime.The prosecution said the action was contrary to the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act.As an alternative to the first count, he faced the charge of conspiring to defraud the public, contrary to the Act.On the second count, the lawmaker was charged with abuse of office, also contrary to the same Act.All the offences were said to have been committed on or about April 23, 2008.Senior principal magistrate Thomas Obutu on Friday acquitted the MP under section 210 of the Criminal Procedure Code.The court found out that Kitutu Chache CDF neither purchased sugar nor did Onyonka himself do so.The magistrate, in his ruling, said tax evasion case could not stand because there was no sugar purchased.The court also found out that there was no documented evidence connecting Onyonka and Kitutu Chache in the purchase of sugar.This was on grounds that the signature in the document and rubber stamp do not belong to the legislator.Obutu said that the state failed to lead any evidence towards the charge of conspiracy."I do not think it will be safe to convict the accused persons if they chose to keep quite in their defense."He added: "The investigations officer left several gaps which were never filled for me to put the accused on their defense."Speaking after the ruling, Onyonka said it has been a tough eight years but he was happy the process finally ended.
