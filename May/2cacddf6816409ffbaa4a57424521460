About half of the Sh6.58 billion 2017-18 Nyeri county budget will go to the wage bill.Nyeri Finance executive Charles Githinji read the budget at the county assembly yesterday.He said the wage bill will constitute 47 per cent, leaving only 53 percent of the budget for development, operations and maintenance. Githinji said the wage bill was occasioned by the county government inheriting workers who were previously posted at the central provincial headquarters.He said the wage bill continues to be a major problem and to make it worse, the clamour for an increase of salaries has become stronger than ever. &ldquo;To overcome this challenge, the county government will expand its local revenue base by undertaking a valuation roll to ensure all land rate payers are brought on board,&rdquo; he said.The county will also acquire a revenue management system besides the Integrated Performance Management System expected to account for every employee&rsquo;s productivity. He said the 2017-18 budget of Sh6 billion will be financed by the equitable share from the national resources.
