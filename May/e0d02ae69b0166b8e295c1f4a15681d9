The Jubilee administration is playing politics with the lives of Kenyans, Mavoko MP Patrick Makau has said. He said it is wrong for the state to reduce the price of maize flour, while those of other basic commodities are still unaffordable. &ldquo;The Jubilee administration should lower the price of sugar, milk and bread to liberate the majority of Kenyans from suffering due to high inflation,&rdquo; Makau said. He spoke in Mlolongo town on Monday. Makau said reducing maize flour has no impact on the common mwananchi if the other commodities are still expensive.&ldquo;Jubilee must go home. We want a government that will make everything affordable to all Kenyans,&rdquo; he said. Makau said the government had lowered the price of maize flour to woo voters.
