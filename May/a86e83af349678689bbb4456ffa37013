Former multiple Safari and Kenya Rally Champion Carl &lsquo;Flash&rdquo; Tundo was peerless as the second round of the Kenya National Rally Raid Championship ended in Magadi over the weekend.Carl co-driven by his long-standing navigator Tim Jessop, was not only the fastest overall driver in his Milner machine but claimed his second straight win of the season to savour a flawless score of 160 points in the car class.Ross Field in his South Africa built CRT was second overall with former champion Adin Haq &lsquo;Paps&rsquo; completing the podium dash in his Range Rover Ebowler.Former motorsports personality of the year, Shivam Vinayak, riding a Kawasaki 450 won the bikers&rsquo; class in fourth overall position.Day 1 of the Vintage Club-organised raid featured 115km of competitive mileage. With 15 competitors enlisted to take part in the event, car class drivers dominated the race with few bikers at it with no quads or buggies. It was a proper raid rally route that consisted of fast flowing roads, twisty sections, rocks and long grassy tracks.Flash Tundo led Day 1 with 16 seconds ahead of Adin Haq &lsquo;Paps&rsquo; and Ross Field third, about 1 mins behind Paps. Joost was a distance fourth, more than 25 mins behind Flash on Day 1 which saw the legendary Ian Duncan encounter navigational issues. Day 2 featured 130kms of competitive mileage and Joost didn&rsquo;t complete the last leg due to mechanical problems.Ross Field, who is a former bike class raid champion, said: &ldquo;The event was very good. The track very hard and serious navigation was required. Some stretches had mega rocks but not without nice fast flowing sections in there. We had a good battle with Flash and Tim but he had the speed and beat us to second position. The organiser did a great job and we look forward to the next raid with new cars coming in.&rdquo;
