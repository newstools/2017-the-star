Kikuyu elders (Kiama kia Ma) in Kiambu county have suspended chairman Waweru wa Mbugua for five years for &ldquo;misrepresenting&rdquo; the group.The elders also suspended 16 other members for four years. They had accompanied Mbugua to visit Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero and promised that elders from Kiambu will support his 2017 reelection.Interim county chairman Choru wa Muiruri said the elders were angered by how Mbugua and the group cursed Royal Media Services chairman Samuel (SK) Macharia in Murang&rsquo;a early this year.He spoke at an elders&rsquo; meeting in Kikuyu town. Muiruri was with Kikuyu constituency chairman David Kinuthia, Lari chairman Patrick Mundati and Kikuyu constituency treasurer Mbugua Njuguna, among others.He said they suspended the officials because &ldquo;they promised Kidero that we are supporting his reelection but we have never discussed the issue as an agenda. The message went as if we had discussed it. We are sending the message that those sentiments were his, not the elders&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;He has misrepresented us on many occasions. This has to stop.&rdquo;The elders said they are Christians and their souls do not allow them to believe in curses, adding that Mbugua did not consult them before attending the activity.
