WHAT is Joe Nyagah upto? President Uhuru Kenyatta's adviser has reportedly quit his position for "something big". It is unclear what the former Cabinet minister is plotting, but we are told that the Man from Mbeere was spotted at the office of the Registrar of Political Parties at Lion Place, Westlands, seeking to be cleared to run in the General Election as an independent. Yesterday he was also spotted at the IEBC, where he obtained relevant clearance for him to run. The question that has got tongues wagging most is: Just what is Joe planning?******************GOVERNORS who lost in the party primaries may be finding it difficult to concentrate on their work, almost six moths before they officially quit office. Most of them have dissapered from the public limelight. A Jubilee governor who lost in the primaries was spotted crestfallen at Party HQ. He could not access the well secured building and had to wait for his appeal like other ordinary Kenyans - outside the gate. Kiambu Governor William Kabogo, for instance, resurfaced on Wednesday. He went to inspect the Thika Level 5 Hospital's reproductive health unit. The 300-bed unit will be opened in June this year. This was among his development records he dangled before the electorate but which they refused to buy.*****************THE Orange party national elections board and Orange House operatives must seek proper security ahead of their National Delegates' Convention today. Reason? Some aspirants and their supporters are so upset by the recent primaries that they may just attack some officials. The aspirants believe NEB officials were bribed to lock them out. In some instances, the same board has defied the party's appeals tribunal, defeating logic how the two organs of the party operate.********************A renowned NGO executive is said to be under intense pressure to vie as an independent candidate for governor in Murang'a County. Corridors has learned the influential CEO has been receiving calls from key people in the county, but he has turned down all requests. It is claimed he is lying low and planning to go for the seat in 2022 and has chosen to instead campaign and support the reelection of the current governor.**********************TROUBLE seems to be brewing in the Mount Kenya region. There are muted murmurs that some of their most vibrant sons and daughters were rigged out in the Jubilee Party primaries. But nobody is courageous enough to name them. Yesterday, a group of tycoons ran a paid advert dissociating themselves from the rumours. The group said they strongly back President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Deputy William Ruto. Those in the know however say the disgruntled group are ready to take the bull by the horns - after the 2017 polls.*************************TALK of capitalising on a dire situation to reap big from people who are desperate. Some nondescript political parties took advantage of a huge number of desperate independent aspirants camped at the Registrar of Political Parties' offices to recruit more members. The parties sent their agents to the entrance of Registrar's offices to woo the candidates. The agents, mostly cute ladies wrapped in tight dresses, approached the aspirants, drawn from all corners of the country, with party fliers. But this was a feint, as the law no longer allows aspirants to party-hop. It may well be the agents hoped the Independents would drop their bids altogether!***********************
