Wananchi Group has reached an agreement to sell off its corporate data services unit to deep-pocketed Synergy Communications for undisclosed value subject to regulatory approval, the entertainment and connectivity firm announced yesterday. SynCom is owned by Convergence Partners Communications Infrastructure Fund &ndash; Africa&rsquo;s largest private equity fund dedicated to ICT infrastructure.The deal, which ends more than a year of sale negotiations which first came to the limelight in March 2016, will see SynCom buy the struggling Wananchi Business Services.Wananchi Business Services operates SimbaNET, Wananchi Telecom and iSAT which offer wholesale internet, data security and video connectivity services, respectively. The services are offered over the company&rsquo;s fibre, wireless and satellite networks for the corporate and enterprise market in East Africa.&ldquo;The decision by the board to sell Wananchi Business Services has been guided by a desire to deepen Wananchi Group&rsquo;s products and services portfolio within the consumer / retail service segment and to provide best-in-class customer experience to all our clients,&rdquo; Wananchi Group chairperson Alex-Handrah Aime said in a statement. The transaction will have to be approved by authorities in various countries, the two companies said. The regulators include the Communications Authority of Kenya and Competition Authority of Kenya. &ldquo;We believe that the transaction will unlock shareholder value amidst a competitive and dynamic operating environment defined by rapid technological changes,&rdquo; Aime said. The two companies, however, declined to divulge more details of the deal, saying: &ldquo;Due to the regulated approval process and varied laws that govern each jurisdiction, Wananchi Group and SynCom are bound to confidentiality tenets that minimise the amount of information that can be shared about the transaction during this pre-approval period.&rdquo; The completion of the transaction will leave Wananchi Group to concentrate on Zuku business which provides internet-enabled home entertainment and telecommunications services. SynCom chief executive Geoff Hardwick said Wananchi Business Services focus on corporate and enterprise customers fit into the company&rsquo;s &ldquo;goal of providing high quality, enterprise communications services and products across the sub-Saharan region&rdquo;.
