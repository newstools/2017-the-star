Opposition chief Raila Odinga yesterday said NASA will not back down on its push to have results declared at the constituency level.The NASA presidential candidate said the opposition will be enjoined in an appeal by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission seeking to overturn a High Court ruling, which affirmed that presidential results announced at the constituencies as binding.But Raila said like in the USA where elections take place at the individual states, the electoral body should allow its constituency returning officers to exercise their constitutional mandate.&ldquo;We have already made an application to be enjoined in that case,&rdquo; Raila said at his Capitol Hill office. Raila said the constitution is clear Kenya&rsquo;s Presidential elections are held at the constituency level.&ldquo;Returning officers at the constituency level are empowered under the law to declare presidential results. The results declared are final and not even the returning officer has powers to change them,&rdquo; the opposition chief said.He said declaration of Presidential results at the constituency level will be critical for the commission in addressing presidential poll petitions.&ldquo;The commission will only address petitions from those specific constituencies where presidential results have been challenged,&rdquo; Raila (pictured) said. &ldquo;In case of a problem in an constituency the returning officer there should be answerable not the Electoral Commission. IEBC has no responsibility over this.&rdquo;
