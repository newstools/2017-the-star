Wiper nominee for Machakos governor Wavinya Ndeti has criticised the losers in the repeat primaries, Bernard Kiala and Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama, for wasting residents&rsquo; time.Ndeti beat Kiala in the repeat polls conducted on Saturday. This came after a court annulled her earlier victory.Ndeti spoke yesterday when she received her nomination certificate. She said Kiala should not have challenged the voice of the people.&ldquo;There are those who felt I was being favoured because I&rsquo;m a woman. They went to court to challenge the voice of the people, unaware that it is also the voice of God. We have now proved to them who we really are,&rdquo; Ndeti said.She garnered 227,947 votes against Kiala&rsquo;s 4,508. In the first polls, Ndeti had 299, 312 votes against Kiala&rsquo;s 4,663 votes.Kiala said he will pursue his political interests outside Wiper, and will make an official communication soon.He said the election was court-instigated and there was no way he would get justice &ldquo;as there was already bad blood between me and the party.&rdquo;Ndeti expressed confidence she will be the first Machakos woman governor. She will face incumbent Alfred Mutua of Maendeleo Chap Chap.Ndeti said just like other women who came before her, she has stood up for the interests of the county and will not relent until it is liberated from misrule.&ldquo;We had female leaders like Syokimau, Syotune and Syonguu, who stood up for the community when things got thick. Just like them, I&rsquo;m now standing up to make sure that never again will we have our community disrespected,&rdquo; she said.An upbeat Ndeti said in the past four years, Kenyans have been deceived that Machakos is doing well, yet residents continue to suffer in poverty.
