The biggest story this week has been about MC Jesse supposedly getting a divorce. The story doing rounds has been one that painted MC Jesse, one of the biggest brands in Kenya let alone comedy as a vile man who has hamstringed his own marriage by first bedding Shix Kapienga. As such, he was in the process of getting a divorce from his wife Nkirote whom he wed in 2010.Speaking to Word Is, Jesse clarified the whole affair."We married while the relationship was on the rock. So we sat down and decided to take a break and try to figure things out back in 2012. We are still friends and continue to raise the most beautiful gift I ever received in my life together. That is only possible because we are friends. And because I keep a small circle, only our immediate families know." He added, "I met Shix through my work at Hot 96 and Churchill Raw. We started off as friends, just going for the same events and gigs due to work but we started dating later. I pursued her because I felt "si nitafute mtu?" I need to move on because I have been living my life as a separated man. I didn't leave Nkirote to be with Shix. No! I focused on my business and making Kenyans laugh after getting separated but the heart wants what the heart wants. She's not a home wrecker as I have seen people alleging. She's a kind, loving person."MC Jesse continued, "It's unfortunate that someone who loves my son and whom my son loves is being dragged through the mud because some blogger wanted hits. How can I stress the fact that Nkirote and I are still friends? We still talk and raise our son together. We have been at peace because there was no malice in my actions. I remember praying to God first to get guidance from God so I would know how to best move forward. That is also why I am sharing my story because I can see how it is hurting the people I hold dear to me more than my own life itself."
