Safaricom's full-year net profit for the period ending&nbsp;March 31&nbsp;jumped 27.1 per cent to Sh48.44 billion from Sh38.1 billion, the giant telco announced&nbsp;Wednesday.&nbsp;The rise in profitability was helped by continued growth in M-Pesa and data services, the listed company told an investor briefing on Wednesday.&nbsp;Total revenues rose 8.8 per cent to Sh 212.89 billion from Sh195.68 billion in&nbsp;March 2016, the East and Central Africa's most profitable company said.Revenue from mobile data posted the highest growth of 38.5 per cent to Sh29.29 billion from Sh21.15 billion, while M-Pesa recorded 32.7 per cent growth to Sh45.08 billion from Sh41.50 billion.Voice revenues continued to account for the largest share of the revenues, although at a slower growth rate of 2.9 per cent to Sh93.46 billion from Sh90.80 billion. Income from SMS services however dropped 3.7 per cent to Sh16.68 billion from Sh17.33 billion the year earlier.Chief executive Officer Bob Collymore&nbsp;attributed the growth to increased revenues from M-Pesa and said&nbsp;three million additional Kenyans joined Safaricom in the past year.&nbsp;"Voice, M-Pesa and data continue to show growth although we have seen a slight decline in SMS revenue," he said."We continue to focus on business that can weather the regulatory and economic forces currently shaping the commercial environment," he added. "We believe in the vast, untapped potential of the Kenyan economy and we will leverage increasingly on intimate customer insights alongside deep investments in critical technologies to drive a long-term strategy for growth."Fixed service revenues jumped 37.4 per cent to Sh5.24 billion from Sh3.82 billion while total customers rose 11.8 per cent to 28.1 million.Safaricom's board further proposed a dividend payout of Sh0.97 a share from Sh0.76 last year.In 2016, the company's net profit for six months to September increased to Sh 23.93 billion from Sh18.08 billion in the same period in 2015.The telco attributed the 32.35 per cent growth to increased revenues from non-voice services, largely M-Pesa and data.Total revenues rose 5.02 per cent to Sh102.1 billion from Sh97.22 billion a year earlier.Voice services was still the single largest source of income at Sh45.77 billion in the six months, although at the slowest pace of 1.1 per cent compared with last year's Sh45.19 billion.More on this:&nbsp;Safaricom half year net profit hits Sh 23.93 billion
