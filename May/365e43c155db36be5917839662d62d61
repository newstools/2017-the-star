Laikipia Governor aspirant Ndiritu Muriithi has blamed the incumbent for failing to tame incessant attacks by herders invading ranches in Laikipia county.He said in a statement on Saturday that Joshua Irungu has not done enough to end the crisis and should be held to account.The politician spoke after a guard was hospitalised in a Nyahururu hospital with bullet injuries he sustained in an altercation with armed herders.The herders had raided Kifuku Ranch on Wednesday in an incident that has cast doubt on whether the attacks are driven by drought."The governor has abdicated his responsibility of raising a voice against the continued injustice being perpetrated against the people.""The logical conclusion can only be that he is complicit to these unwarranted invasions unless he speaks out against them," Muriithi said."The excuse that these invaders are in search of grass and pasture for their livestock is no longer tenable," the MP said.A source at one of the affected ranches told the Star that the attacks against them are political instigated in and attempt to repossess the rancher's land.The concern is that the criminals still invade the ranches yet the area has experienced rains for several weeks, restoring pasture."About half the cattle moved out of Laikipia but the rest are still pressuring Kifuku, LNC, Ngorare, Ol Maisor, Sosian, Loisaba and Kamogi," the source said.The source accused Laikipia North MP Mathew Lempurkel of inciting the invaders "for political gains ahead of the August 8 general election."The MP has denied any involvement in the attacks.Read: MP Lempurkel cleared for lack of proof in Voorspuy murder caseDuring the Wednesday raid, the herders fired more than 25 bullets bearing Kenya Ordnance Factories Corporation stamps.David Hewitt, a farm manager, had seven bullets fired at his vehicle of which two rounds narrowly missed him but hit the car."Pokot militias have got into a routine of stopping vehicles on the Maralal road near Mugie. They shoot at them and rob drivers and passengers."The source said the attacks are common between Ol Maisor and the Laikipia-Baringo border.For more than four months, hundreds of pastoralists from Baringo, Isiolo and Samburu counties, moving with around 135,000 cattle, have invaded Laikipia.Read: Land invasion wrecks LaikipiaIn March this year, an estimated 10,000 acres were set ablaze in the Laikipia Nature Conservancy.
