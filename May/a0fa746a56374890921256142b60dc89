Funyula MP Paul Otuoma has picked former deputy county commissioner Solomon Abwaku as his running mate for Busia governor. He will face Governor Sospeter Ojaamong as an independent. Otuoma’s supporters from Teso have praised the decision to settle on Abwaku, saying the move will help bring the people of Busia together. “I have made up my mind to pick Abwaku as my running mate,” Otuoma said on Friday. However, the move by the Funyula legislator has generated mixed reactions from Ojaamong’s supporters. Some Ojaamong’s supporters say Abwaku should have turned down Otuoma’s offer and instead supported the incumbent. “We now consider Otuoma’s running mate a betrayer to Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong,” a supporter, who sought anonymity, said.
