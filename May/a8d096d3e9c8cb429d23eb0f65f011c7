Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has won a second term in office, the interior minister has announced.Out of more than 40 million votes cast, he received 57%, or close to 23m votes in total.Rouhani, a moderate who agreed a deal with world powers to limit Iran's nuclear programme, will thus avoid a second-round run-off.His main challenger has complained about alleged voting irregularities.Ebrahim Raisi, a conservative cleric, accused supporters of Rouhani of hundreds of acts of propaganda at voting booths - banned under electoral law.State TV congratulated Rouhani on his victory. Interior Minister Abdul Reza Rahmani Fazli said Raisi received 38.5%, or 15.7m votes - not enough to take the election to a second round.Voting time had been extended by five hours on Friday, until midnight, amid an unexpectedly high turnout of about 70%.Election officials said the extensions to voting hours were due to "requests" and the "enthusiastic participation of people".Rouhani, 68, promised a moderate vision and an outward-looking Iran, and tied his success to the success of the nuclear deal brokered between Iran, the US and other countries in 2015.US President Donald Trump opposes the deal, which eased sanctions on the Middle Eastern country, but his White House renewed it earlier this week.
