NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga and his running mate Kalonzo Musyoka will present their nomination papers to the IEBC next Sunday.Raila dismissed claims that Kalonzo had submitted nomination papers as the nominee for presidency for Wiper.He termed the claims as propaganda, saying the electoral agency has not been receiving nomination papers of candidates.&ldquo;As you know that the IEBC has announced the date when the candidates are going to submit their nomination papers. Kalonzo and I have decided to submit our documents on May 28,&rdquo; Raila said.&ldquo;Any speculation is unfounded. You cannot present any document to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission before the formal announcement of the receipts&rdquo;.He added that the IEBC has already gazetted official dates of submission of nomination documents for the various elective positions.Raila spoke on Sunday at St Stephen&rsquo;s ACK Cathedral, Kisumu.According to the electoral agency report released on Saturday, Kalonzo was listed as the Wiper nominee for President.In the report, Raila has been submitted as the ODM candidate, but with no running mate.It further indicates that out of 19 presidential hopefuls, only President Uhuru Kenyatta has presented William Ruto as his running mate under the Jubilee Party.Raila was named NASA candidate on April 27 at Uhuru Park, Nairobi, and Kalonzo his running mate.The former Prime Minister said they will campaign for NASA candidates in every constituency to ensure they have majority of governor, MP, MCA and senator seats.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t just want to win the presidency, we want to also have majority in both Houses of Parliament so that we are able to effectively prosecute our agenda in the government,&rdquo; Raila said.He said NASA has fielded several candidates for various political seats, and ODM party has more than 200 candidates countrywide.Raila downplayed his remarks that NASA supporters should not vote for independent candidates as this was likely to cause voter apathy in their strongholds.&ldquo;Election is a competition and the independent candidates too have rights to participate in the electoral process in a democratic manner,&rdquo; he added.Further, Raila defended the NASA stand on getting the 10 million plus votes, saying they have enough statistical evidence to back the numbers.&ldquo;We have looked at our strongholds and the swing votes and, in fact, we have 12 million votes, which we are sure of,&rdquo; he said.The NASA principal dismissed claims by the Jubilee Party that they will get 14 million votes, terming it a mere reaction to the strong wave of NASA support.He expressed confidence that the opposition will form the government as Kenyans are yearning for transformative administration.&ldquo;Kenyans must come out to send the present government home. For us to realise this we must take personal initiative to verify if we are registered as voters and cast the vote in the August polls,&rdquo; Raila said.He said Kenyans will never suffer under NASA leadership, as they are suffering now due to high cost of living.
