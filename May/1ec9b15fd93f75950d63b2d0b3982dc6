The Jubilee administration&rsquo;s over-reliance on external borrowing led to the high cost of essential commodities and will enslave the current and future generations, Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto has said.The government had exceeded its external borrowing limit, leading to unmanageable debt, he said on Monday during a Chama Cha Mashinani rally in Motony, Narok West.Rutto was with area MP Patrick Ntutu, the party&rsquo;s governor nominee, Narok West MP aspirant Gabriel Tongoyo and Ilmotiok MCA Joseph Barusei.&ldquo;Kenya is deeply mired in debt with high costs of essential commodities and food, including sugar, maize flour, milk and fuel. It is time for Kenyans to vote out Jubilee and let NASA take charge of fixing the socio-economic problems,&rdquo; the CCM leader said.The NASA co-principal said the World Bank and the IMF had raised serious concern about Kenya&rsquo;s external borrowing. &ldquo;Four years ago, external borrowing stood at Sh1.75 trillion and it now stands at Sh.4.05 trillion,&rdquo; Rutto said.&ldquo;The Jubilee administration has chosen to enslave the current and future generations with external debt, which will take decades to repay.&rdquo;
