Elgeyo Marakwet Deputy Governor Gabriel Lamaon has said he is not bitter after he was dropped as Governor Alex Tolgos's running mate.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t consider the sacking a disappointment. I have worked with Governor Tolgos well and will continue to support him,&rdquo; he said.Tolgos will on Friday next week unveil Wesley Rotich, 28, as his new running mate.He chaired a meeting of his executive committee in Iten town where he informed them of his decision, but he is yet to formally make the announcement.Lamaon, however, confirmed that he had been dropped and said it was the governor&rsquo;s prerogative to pick anyone he wished to work with.&ldquo;I take the decision in good faith and will offer support to ensure that the governor is reelected,&rdquo; he said.Lamaon said he is grateful for having been given the chance to serve under the governor for four years.&ldquo;He gave me chance to serve as the first deputy governor of our county and I still believe he is the best governor for the county,&rdquo; he said.During the JP primaries, Tolgos lost in polling stations close to Lamaon's home.He got 17 votes at Kipsoen and 77 at Chebonet against Keiyo South MP Jackson Kiptanui's 500 and 300 respectively.Sources said Tolgos, a Marakwet, was unhappy that Labaon was unable to get him votes from the Keiyo community.Rotich is an economist and has been serving as the county director of cooperatives. He will be the youngest Deputy Governor if Tolgos wins on August 8.Tolgos however faces a tough challenge after the Keiyo community resolved to back tea estate manager Moses Changwony to run as an independent.The Keiyo are angry after losing out on all seats during the Jubilee primaries.
