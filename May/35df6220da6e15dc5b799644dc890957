A 25-year-old suspected thief was burnt beyond recognition by the public at Mutarakwa, Limuru constituency, on Saturday. Residents said Anthony Mwaniki was found at Nyambare trading centre and residents started beating him to force him to reveal his accomplices, blaming them for a spate of burglaries in the area. Mwaniki named a friend and when they went to check his house found generators and electronic goods suspected to have been stolen. &ldquo;Whenever he is seen, houses are broken into and property stolen,&rdquo; said Simon Ndung&rsquo;u, a Kamirithu resident. Police boss James Mwaura urged residents to report theft cases instead.
