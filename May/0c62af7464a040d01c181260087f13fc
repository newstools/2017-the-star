A parliamentary aspirant for Kiharu has announced he will run as an independent candidate. Karanja Mburu, known as Wamatangi, alleges rigging by his opponent Ndindi Nyoro in the race for the Jubilee Party ticket.Wamatangi has raised concerns about the party&rsquo;s failure to announce the results of the Murang&rsquo;a Township, Gaturi and Wangu wards primaries. He insists he defeated Nyoro. Senator Kembi Gitura has appealed the nominations results, and says he will run as an independent. He wants the political parties&rsquo; tribunal to force JP to repeat the primaries in Kiharu and Mathioya constituencies. Kembi lost to Kiharu MP Irungu Kang&rsquo;ata.Governor aspirant Jamleck Kamau lost to Murang&rsquo;a boss Mwangi Wairia. Kamau said he will not file an appeal, but instead will consult with his supporters on the next course of action. In Maragua, MP aspirant Anthony Chege will run as an independent after losing to nominated MCA Mary Waithera. &ldquo;Having many people running as independents will avoid voter apathy,&rdquo; Wamatangi said. He says JP failed to conduct free and fair polls.
