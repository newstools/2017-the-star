Thirty-seven Administration Police officers have sat a law course exam in Athi River subcounty. They included two serjeants, 10 corporals and 25 constables. Supervisor Joseph Yakau said the exams set by Administration Police Examinations Council are compulsory for all serving officers. He spoke to the Star shortly after the exam ended at Mavoko Secondary School in Athi River town on Saturday. “It is meant to determine whether they have forgotten the law they learned during their training in college,” Yakau said. Those who excel in the exam are considered knowledgeable in enforcing the law in line with the Constitution. Yakau added that officers who understand the law and their responsibilities should be perfect in executing their duties. Those who fail the annual examination will take it again next year. Deputy AP commander Edward Mwangi urged the officers to read more about the law.
