Two losers in the Murang&rsquo;a JP senator primaries have urged other losers to concede defeat and support the winner.Joseph Mbai and Peter Njangi on Tuesday accused those resigning from JP to run as independents of being disloyal to President Uhuru Kenyatta.The duo, who held a joint press briefing in Murang&rsquo;a town, said the county must stay put in Jubilee, adding that it should not be seen to be going against the President.Mbai expressed his disappointment with Senator Kembi Gitura, who ditched JP on the same day to run as an independent.Mbai got 14,483 votes. They lost to Kiharu MP Irungu Kang&rsquo;ata.Mbai said Gitura keeps alleging there were malpractices and he was rigged out, yet he had faith in the nomination before it was conducted.&ldquo;We all participated in the nominations and we know that we all lost fairly and squarely,&rdquo; Mbai said.&ldquo;Gitura should know that the same people who voted during the nominations will be the ones voting in August. He may lose by a bigger margin.&ldquo;The President has asked us to support the party to strengthen it. With all due respect, I&rsquo;m urging Kembi and others who lost to take his word seriously.&rdquo;Njangi said it is disturbing that so many aspirants are dissatisfied with the nominations results.He dismissed claims that DP William Ruto manipulated the results to install leaders affiliated to him.&ldquo;The President enlisted Ruto&rsquo;s help to oversee the exercise, following the shambolic nominations on March 21 that were later called off,&rdquo; he said.Njangi faulted the motive of the Mt Kenya Foundation, which is alleged to be supporting aspirants who are decamping from the Jubilee Party to run independently.There are reports the foundation, founded by a group of business tycoons from the Central region, led by Equity Bank chair Peter Munga, is rallying together some of the prominent aspirants from the region who lost in the nominations.&ldquo;By supporting people who are resigning from the party, the foundation is encouraging a dangerous trend that may divide the President&rsquo;s support in Jubilee areas,&rdquo; Njangi said.He said the party may lose major seats in key areas, especially in Nairobi, where candidates affiliated to the President have declared their interest to run against ODM&rsquo;s Evans Kidero.&ldquo;This group will bring divisions in the Jubilee zones and may end up costing the President,&rdquo; Njangi said.
