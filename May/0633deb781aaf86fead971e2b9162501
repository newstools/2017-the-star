Mombasa governor hopeful and Nyali MP Hezron Awiti has become the first candidate to announce a strategy to aid economic growth if he is elected.He is adopting a bottom-up development strategy. Awiti said Village College Management Committees will be formed to decide which project should be prioritised.Unlike the current administration, where top mangers call the shots, the Vibrant Democratic Party, headed by Awiti, is planning to empower residents at the village level to have the final say.The committees will be composed of tribes living in a particular village and an investor, who will advise on the economic viability of projects.&ldquo;Ours will be a people power administration,&rdquo; Awiti said to the Star in his office on Monday.Governor Hassan Joho&rsquo;s system has been in place since 2013, where executives derived the agenda to be pursued.Projects carried out in the county give Joho an edge, but economic analysts say an alternative and viable option will be more preferred, and such a candidate will be considered.There have been concerns that residents are not involved in making decisions on projects undertaken by the administration.But the county claims there has always been public participation in the budget-making process, a crucial stage in development.Other governor hopefuls, including Jubilee&rsquo;s Suleiman Shahbal and Wiper&rsquo;s Hassan Omar, are playing their cards close to their chests. They have, however, sent hints, including on investor-oriented approaches.All the governor hopefuls are striving to convince voters on how they will improve the economy if elected.Joho has said annual allocations are limited to initiating meaningful development.But Awiti deviates from this perspective, saying change can be realised despite limited funds, through robust planning and having &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; priorities coupled with the village teams.He said another model called &ldquo;Revolutionary Councils for Democracy and Development&rdquo; will be an alternative platform to ensure resources are devolved to all levels. &ldquo;The RCDD will be councils that will be elected by the people and will be the core vehicles that the people will use so as to be part and parcel of the county government&rsquo;s governance,&rdquo; Awiti said.
