&ldquo;Take off your clothes,&rdquo; Bill says abruptly.&ldquo;What?&rdquo; I ask.&ldquo;You want to know why you are here? Take off your clothes,&rdquo; he says.&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I say, the feeling of cold dread returning.&ldquo;Take off your clothes, right now or spend the night in the trunk. It&rsquo;s up to you,&rdquo; he says calmly. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I say again. He walks towards me, seemingly unfazed by my refusal.&ldquo;Causality is a genetic connection of phenomena through which one thing under certain conditions gives rise to something else,&rdquo; he says, repeating what I said earlier word for word. I hold my breath.He casually grabs me and carries me towards the trunk. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; I scream. He tosses me inside.&ldquo;Cause-and-effect Samantha,&rdquo; he says and slams the trunk shut. I start to get a panic attack as he padlocks it. &ldquo;Wait! Please! Not again! Please let me out,&rdquo; I plead. I hear the distant sound of the banging door. He&rsquo;s gone. I thought I was all cried out but the tears are back and this time they don&rsquo;t stop flowing. He said I&rsquo;d be in here all night. I didn&rsquo;t even make it for a few hours last time before I passed out. They&rsquo;ll open this damn trunk in the morning and I&rsquo;ll be dead. Asphyxiation is a pretty horrible way to go. If I don&rsquo;t fancy slowly succumbing to lack of oxygen, I really need to stop panicking! &ldquo;Come on, Samantha, keep calm,&rdquo; I whisper to myself. The only way I will preserve the air I have is to relax. I will have to force myself to meditate. I took a class in transcendental meditation once, and I know I can easily lose myself for half an hour or so. The only problem is that one needs to be comfortable and I&rsquo;m anything but, in this cramped space. I&rsquo;ll have to make the most of it. I start chanting my mantra, my tears still flowing silently. I chant and chant until finally I slowly float away from the trunk. In my mind&rsquo;s eye, I&rsquo;m far away from this place. It&rsquo;s so beautiful. I&rsquo;m in a field. There are sunflowers everywhere. I run as fast as I can with the wind in my hair. I laugh. I feel so carefree. Every time I begin to cramp from the uncomfortable position, I go back to the mantra and return to the field. By the time the door to the room opens, I&rsquo;m at peace. My breathing is controlled and I don&rsquo;t even feel the heat. The mind is truly a powerful thing. The padlock is removed and the trunk cover is lifted. I slowly open my eyes. It&rsquo;s not recommended to jolt out of a meditative state. &ldquo;Get up!&rdquo; a male voice orders. I slowly rise up, every joint in my body embracing the release. When I&rsquo;m fully upright I realise it&rsquo;s the other captor, not Bill. Oh, crap. I&rsquo;m better off in the trunk!&ldquo;You were better off doing as Bill said,&rdquo; he says as though reading my thoughts. &ldquo;You would have been better prepared.&rdquo; &ldquo;Prepared for what?&rdquo; I ask, still disorientated. &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; he answers mysteriously then closes the door behind him.Ten or so minutes later, a short, stout man walks into the room. He has a briefcase. &ldquo;Hello, Samantha,&rdquo; he says. I eye him nervously. &ldquo;Have they hurt you?&rdquo; he asks.I shake my head. &ldquo;Good, let me see,&rdquo; he says. He raises my face to the light to check for bruises and finds none. He grunts with satisfaction. &ldquo;Take off your clothes,&rdquo; he says.Oh crap. This again?! I want to shout &ldquo;No!&rdquo; but this time I bite my lip. I say nothing and instead I do as he asks and take off my dress.
