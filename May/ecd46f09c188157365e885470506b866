Darassa, a Tanzanian rapper who hit the headlines with his hit song Muziki featuring Ben Pol, has come out to confirm that he sought the services of a witchdoctor at one point in his life."Nikisema sijawahi enda kwa mganga, nitakua nimedanganya. Nimewahi kwenda kwa mganga mara moja kwenye maisha yangu."Darassa, however, said it was long ago and he did not go to seek black magic powers over his music but for personal issues."Sikuenda kwenye vitu vyangu personal," he said. "Nilikua nacheza football, na tulienda ki-team. Team yangu ilikua inaamini kwenye hio challenge. Nilikua team captain kwenye team yangu na nilikua na umri mdogo zaidi. Sikua na nguvu ya kuwa against maagizo ya viongozi ambayo walitupa."When asked if he still goes to seek black magic, the Too Much hit maker said: "It's a lifestyle, watu wanafanya hivyo kusurvive lakini sio mimi. Sio lifestyle yangu wala sio muziki wangu."Darassa, who is set to release a song this week, further revealed that he is now a saved man and could never advice the youth to seek witchcraft."Tell you what, Mungu ni wa ajabu sana. Nimedeal na Mungu wangu toka kipindi nina njaa mpaka saa hizi ananipa hela ya kula. Mungu yuko na anachokitaka ndio kinakuwa.Kama nataka kumwambia mtu kitu lazima nimwambie Mungu ni kila kitu."
