Kitui Senator David Musila has said he will run for governor as an independent candidate after losing in the Wiper nominations.Musila made the announcement on Saturday during a rally at Endau Primary School, Kitui East subcounty. He said he is on a mission to transform Kitui and make life smooth and worthwhile for residents.&ldquo;If you elect me governor, you will experience a transformation that has never happened [in Kitui] since the creation of the earth. Provision of water will be my top priority,&rdquo; Musila said. He said Kanziku and Kaningo areas face serious water shortage.The senator said he helped raise money for water projects, but the cash was diverted to less priority areas.&ldquo;Some of the money is being used to bribe people to vote back the incumbent as you continue to suffer,&rdquo; Musila said.He said 55 years since Kenya attained Independence, there are no health facilities near their homes where mothers can give birth.Musila promised to build many health facilities in the Kitui county so that residents do not have to travel long distances to seek medical attention.&ldquo;My administration will ensure health facilities are closer to your homes. If one is bitten by a snake or if you want to give birth, there will be a health facility nearby.They will be adequately staffed and not disused buildings because there will be money for that purpose,&rdquo; Musila said.The senator announced he has resigned from Wiper as a member and party national chairman.He accused party leader Kalonzo Musyoka of engineering his defeat in the race for the Wiper ticket.Musila was last week cleared by the Registrar of Political Parties to run as an independent candidate.Governor Julius Malombe will defend his seat on the Wiper ticket.
