Musician Charles Njagua, alias Jaguar, has been confirmed as the Jubilee Party candidate for the Starehe parliamentary seat race.The Jubilee Party Appeal Tribunal ruled in favour of Jaguar after the Starehe party nomination was marred with controversy.Jaguar was contesting for the ticket with incumbent MP Maina Kamanda, who has served as Starehe MP for 19 years.Speaking after being awarded the certificate, Jaguar could not hide his joy. He praised Jubilee Party for showing a high level of fairness in handling its disputes.&ldquo;I want to commend JP for how it handled this complaint and came up with the right decision. This is enough proof that there is a chance for youths in the party,&rdquo; Jaguar said. Kamanda first contested for a political seat in 1979 for the councillor seat in Ngara.He represented the area until 1997 when he fought for the Starehe Parliamentary seat. In his years as a politician, Kamanda served as a cabinet minister in various posts as well as Kanu secretary, Nairobi branch, between 1988 and 1992.Jaguar told off Kamanda, saying he was out to frustrate young leaders. &ldquo;Kamanda has been stealing votes in almost all the elections. Even the people of Starehe had given up on the change they hoped to have,&rdquo; he said. The tribunal previously sought for consensus between the two candidates to resolve the issue, but Jaguar protested. Jaguar and his supporters on Thursday last week protested the declaration of Kamanda as the winner.This was after poll officials said the artist lost to the incumbent, who garnered 10,374 votes. The results declared at Jamhuri High School on Thursday indicated tJaguar got 8,391 votes. The Jubilee Party invalidated the nomination of Kamanda as the Starehe constituency winner.
