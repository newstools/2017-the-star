The Technical University of Mombasa on Tuesday signed a pact with the Food and Agriculture Organisation on behalf of Jumuiya ya Kaunti za Pwani to improve food security at the Coast. JKP members endorsed the deal. They are governors Amason Kingi (Kilifi), Hassan Joho (Mombasa), Hussein Dado (Tana River), Issa Timamy (Lamu), John Mruttu (Taita Taveta) and Kwale’s Salim Mvurya. The Sh11 million project — Supporting Formulation of Food and Nutrition Security for Coast Counties — is funded by FAO. A delegation from FAO and Mombasa county on Monday met acting VC Laila Abubakar and DVC Joseph Rasowo to finalise the arrangements of the signing. JKP has been working with Coast-based universities and scholars to improve residents’ lives through improving the tourism and agriculture sectors. TUM is expected to sustain the project through providing an independent and reliable university system through its School of Business, expert resources and thought leadership to ensure development and implementation of the economic blue print and the food and nutrition strategy.
