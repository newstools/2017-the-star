A crossborder aerial census of elephants and buffaloes in Kenya and Tanzania was launched yesterday in Narok. The two-week Mara-Serengeti census will determine the numbers of elephants and buffaloes, their distribution, trends and human activities in their habitats.The survey is funded by the Kenya Wildlife Service, Narok county and the World Wildlife Fund for Nature, Kenya. The results will be used to make wildlife management policy decisions and determine the the effectiveness of conservation interventions.The last census was in 2014. It is held every three years.The launch was presided over by Narok county secretary Simon Sopia, who represented Governor Samuel Tunai.Lena Munke, the Tourism and Wildlife executive, said the county had made great strides in conservation.It has recruited 300 rangers trained at the KWS Paramilitary Academy in Manyani last year.Last month, President Uhuru Kenyatta launched the Sekenani Road .She said Narok faces conservation challenges &mdash; emerging sedentary lifestyles, sale and fencing of land, and pastoralists turning to farming &mdash; which undermine wildlife conservation.&ldquo;Mara can&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t be fenced soon because of links to wildlife dispersal areas,&rdquo; she said.KWS Board of Trustees member Brian Heath urged all interested parties to make conservation a legitimate and viable land use.He said past surveys found a significant decline in wildlife numbers in the last 50 years.&ldquo;We have to try and change this trend. We have dealt with poaching and sale of ivory, but elephants are being killed in retaliation for destroying people&rsquo;s livelihoods,&rdquo; Heath said.&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make conservation of elephants a viable land use to attract investors seeking returns and provide incentives, the way it&rsquo;s done in agriculture.&rdquo;WWF-Kenya director of conservation Jared Bosire warned that the Mara is at great risk and urgent measures are needed to protect it.&ldquo;Without the Mau and the Mara River, we have no Maasai Mara. As communities make their land available for conservation, they should get direct and indirect benefits,&rdquo; he said.Bosire said WWF-Kenya has worked in the greater Mara for the past 15 years using an integrated landscape approach from the Mau catchment to the lowlands in Serengeti.WWF is working with Narok to develop spatial planning and regulate land use.
