President Uhuru Kenyatta on Wednesday asked security agencies to abandon a 'silo mentality' where each unit operates alone.He said the system has proved to be ineffective especially in the face of threats posed by terrorism and extremism around the globe.Uhuru called on all security agencies to develop a multi-agency approach adding that this has helped the country improve its security.He said this during a lecture at the National Defence College where the 19th batch of senior level officers graduated.It was the President&rsquo;s first lecture to trainees at the country&rsquo;s premier military institution.The officers were drawn from Kenya among other African countries including Egypt, Nigeria, Zambia, Rwanda, Zimbabwe, and Zambia.The President said cooperation between agencies has seen the government put an end to many forms of crimes."A multi-agency approach, as opposed to the traditional silo approach, has paid dividends in the war against terrorist groups and networks," the President said.He said a good example of the multi-agency approach is the ongoing Operation Linda Boni."It has demonstrated that security agencies can achieve success by working together to counter terrorism and any other threat to our nation."The President, who was accompanied by Deputy President William Ruto, said the joint operation approach is being replicated across the country.He touched on many aspects of Kenya&rsquo;s security including the decision to make Kenya&rsquo;s border with Somalia more secure."Our aim is not to divide people or to frustrate legal trade.""This is an example of how hard and soft power approaches are combined to positive effect for our national security," he added.The Head of State further called on security agencies to adopt proactive measures to improve security for Kenyans.He said Kenya&rsquo;s security agencies have served the country well for the last 50 years but the dynamism of today&rsquo;s environment demands that they transition."From a mostly reactive national security stance that engages problems as they arise, to a frame of mind and planning that prioritises prevention and anticipation and that reflects our people-centric constitution," Uhuru said.Later, at a separate function within the National Defence College, President Kenyatta launched Kenya&rsquo;s Defence Policy.
