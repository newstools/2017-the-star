It is not a good idea to give extra sick leave days to civil servants living with HIV-Aids. If it were, why not give the same extension to people living with disability or any other number of drawbacks? They would all deserve extra time too.It is an ill-though-out policy. To begin with it would force people to declare their HIV-Aids status publicly. And if perfectly healthy people take advantage of the extension, as some invariably would, it would be extremely unfair to their colleagues and irritating to their employers. HIV-positive civil servants are already entitled to sick leave when they are unwell.Latest research in the United States has shown that if you are on ARVs your life expectancy is almost the same as that of HIV-negative people.There&rsquo;s no need to make HIV-positive civil servants feel abnormal or entitled to special treatment.The authorities should go back to the drawing board on this one and come up with a policy that does not profile HIV-positive bureaucrats as extraordinarily special cases.
