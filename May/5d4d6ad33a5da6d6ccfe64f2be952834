My name runs through Deputy President William Ruto&rsquo;s mind more than his wife&rsquo;s, Baringo Senator Gideon Moi has said.He said Ruto&rsquo;s mission in Baringo and the entire Rift Valley is purely for his own selfish gain.Moi said Ruto&rsquo;s obsession to see him voted out on August 8 forces his political enemies to sing his name even in their bedrooms.The senator faces a tough challenge from former Betting and Licensing Board boss Simon Chelugui.He said Ruto simply wants him to disappear from politics so he can succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta in 2022.Moi was addressing the public at the launch of his campaign at his birth home in Kambi Moi, Eldama Ravine, Baringo county, on Saturday.His sentiments come barely a week after Jubilee nominees in Baringo, led by Eldama Ravine MP Moses Lessonet, said Kanu is dead and gone.Moi said Ruto frequents Baringo more than any other place in Kenya, promises and channels millions of shillings worth of projects, but not because he loves the people.&ldquo;Take it from me, once you vote me out and replace me with another senator in August you will never ever see Ruto set foot on Baringo soil,&rdquo; he said.
