The government has released 750,000 bags of maize from the strategic reserves to help bring down the skyrocketing price of unga.At least 450,000 of the 90kg bags were released to big millers in February and the remaining 300,000 bags last week, most of it sold to small millers.A bag is being sold at Sh3,000 to millers to address the shortage of maize and reduce the rising cost of essential commodities. A 2kg packet of maize flour now retails at Sh150, up from Sh100 in January.Government spokesman Eric Kiraithe said by his own estimation, the price of 2kg packet of maize flour should come down to Sh110 in a month&rsquo;s time.&ldquo;The maize imports are intended to increase the maize stocks in the country and subsequently lower the price of Unga,&rdquo; Kiraithe said.
