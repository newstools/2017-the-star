Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong has dismissed claims that NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga will lose focus on his presidential bid if he campaigns for party nominees. A section of Busia ODM officials on Monday cautioned Raila against involving himself in local politics, urging him to instead strengthen the party and seek support for his own bid. The Nambale, Budalang&rsquo;i, Butula, Funyula and Matayos ODM officials on Monday declared their support for Funyula MP Paul Otuoma, an independent candidate for Busia govenor. They promised to campaign for the Funyula MP, despite having resigned from the party after the party primaries. But Ojaamong said he will not be shaken and will concentrate on his campiagns and Raila&rsquo;s bid. He said, &ldquo;Some of those issuing such statements are con men who are no longer members of ODM. We have enough votes. Whoever is willing to decamp to Jubilee is free, we are not afraid.&rdquo;
