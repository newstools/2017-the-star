Protesters brought business to a standstill in Iten, Elgeyo Marakwet county, yesterday,delaying a meeting between the IEBC and aspirants for several hours.This is after supporters of an MCA, whose name never appeared in IEBC&rsquo;s list of aspirants, took to the streets before storming the electoral agency&rsquo;s offices. The demonstrators were demanding why the name of Ambrose Kimutai, commonly known as Roho Juu, JP nominee for Kapchumutwa MCA, was missing. Fredrick Chemaluk said supporters were shocked to realise Kimutai&rsquo;s name was missing, and instead the name of Stephen Kemboi, who came second, appeared on the list. He claimed some JP election officials may have engineered the problem. Elgeyo Marakwet IEBC county returning officer Moses Sunkuli said the commission listed names as received from political parties.
