Many recruits were turned away during the KDF recruitment in Mwingi on Thursday due to low weight and matching identification documents. Lieutenant Canali Nkaduda said it was unfortunate that they had to disqualify them. The weight requirement is always 54.55kg for men and 50kg for women. Many, especially fresh from college, did not make the weight. “We had another challenge in that some identification documents did not match with the holder of IDs fingerprints. We had a hard time but the registrar’s office should be keen,” Nkaduda said. “Some were faded and others could not match at all. We had no other option apart from turning them away despite all the efforts they made.” However, he did not disclose the number of candidates they intended to select. “We used to announce in the past but for now we will not.”
