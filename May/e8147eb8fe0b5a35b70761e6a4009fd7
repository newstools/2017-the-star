Governors should be excluded from writing reports on county assets as the Intergovernmental Technical Relations Committee is tasked with the responsibility of assessing assets and liabilities, Peter Munya has said. “So the recent proposal that governors write reports is wrong. Furthermore, there is a process of handing over when one’s term expires. Why are governors who are still in office being told to handover and to who? The county government and the national government are structured the same way. When the sitting governor is not elected, there is a handing over and assumption of office,” the Council of Governors chairman said. He said the proposal is fuelled by anti-devolution forces. The Meru governor said devolution has brought about a lot of positive change in Kenya. Munya spoke at Meru National Polytechnic on Saturday where he met members of various cooperatives.
