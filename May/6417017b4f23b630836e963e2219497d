The number of al Shabaab recruits from Lamu being murdered by militants in Somalia is rising.Operation Linda Boni director James Seriani said recruits from Lamu are no longer trusted by the militia.He said, as a result, many recruits from Lamu have been killed by the very militia they went to join.Seriani said a considerable number of recruits were killed between March and April this year.Speaking in Lamu on Sunday, Seriani cautioned youths from the county against joining the terror group, saying they will not benefit.&ldquo;We have reports that at least six recruits from Lamu were killed by al Shabaab in Somalia after they were suspected of being spies. For some reason, the militia appears not to trust recruits from Lamu and that&rsquo;s why we are warning youths against joining al Shabaab,&rdquo; Seriani said.He termed the ongoing Operation Linda Boni a success, saying it has helped restore peace and calm in the county.Seriani urged residents to continue cooperating with the security agencies in the operation.He said with the help of the public, they have reached their objective in the operation. &ldquo;For instance, we have been able to seal all routes that were being used by the militants to cross into Lamu, especially in the Boni Forest. We can confidently say things are fine again,&rdquo; Seriani said.He urged returnees who have secretly crept back into the county to voluntarily go for rehabilitation, failing which they will be treated like suspects and arrested.
