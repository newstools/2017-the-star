A day after Rift Valley regional coordinator Wanyama Musiambo announced there will be no political campaigns in Laikipia and Samburu, leaders in Laikipia want the national government to take full responsibility for security matters.Led by governor aspirant Nderitu Muriithi, they said it is the responsibility of the government to protect lives and property. Speaking in Nanyuki town yesterday when the IEBC met aspirants, Muriithi asked why cases of insecurity are on the rise.The former Laikipia West legislator accused the county government of remaining silent, despite killings, destruction and theft occasioned by migrant herders.Rumuruti, Olmoran, Kirimon, Marmanet, Mukogodo East, Segera, Mithiga and Matuiku in Laikipia West and North subcounties are listed as disturbed and dangerous. &ldquo;Why is the Laikipia county government silent on these matters? Are you friends to these criminals? This week alone a grader was destroyed at ADC Mutara ranch, a government establishment. When will these acts stop?&rdquo; Muriithi said.He urged the IEBC to give the way forward on the issue, adding that it is disheartening, considering that campaigns will formally begin on Sunday.
