Kirinyaga Governor Joseph Ndathi will defend his seat as an independent candidate after he was defeated by former Devolution CS Anne Waiguru in the Jubilee Party primaries.The Star has established Ndathi travelled to Nairobi on Wednesday, where he got clearance from the Registrar of Political Parties after he resigned from JP on Monday. On Thursday afternoon, Ndathi presented his symbol to the electoral agency.Inside sources told the Star Ndathi reached the decision after wide consultation with his political strategists.When reached for comment, Ndathi told the Star in a text message, &ldquo;I submitted my symbol to the IEBC yesterday [Thursday] and will be running as an independent candidate.&rdquo;PNU backs Ndathi&rsquo;s reelection bidThe PNU Kirinyaga branch is backing Ndathi&rsquo;s reelection.Speaking to the Star on the phone on Friday, county chairman Bishop Cyrus Githaka said the party will campaign for Ndathi and provide him with campaign resources.In the primaries, Waiguru won with 100,632 votes, while Kirinyaga Central MP Joseph Gitari was second with 46,678 and Ndathi had 17,085.Ndathi dismissed the nominations, saying they were a mockery of democracy.The governor did not vote during the nominations as a mob of youth burnt voting materials at the Rukenya Primary School polling centre, where he was supposed to cast his ballot.&ldquo;This exercise is flawed. Some ballot papers have no serial numbers, an indication they have either been photocopied or re-printed locally, and the distribution indicates a plot to rig. My strongholds have received fewer ballot papers than my opponents&rsquo; strongholds,&rdquo; Ndathi told the Star on the phone then.Governor lost appealNdathi disputed the results and launched an appeal with the JP tribunal for the election to be nullified. The tribunal ruled in favour of Waiguru.Gitari also appealed against the results, citing massive irregularities. The tribunal was to give a verdict on Gitari&rsquo;s petition on Thursday evening.The Star has not established the outcome of the petition or whether the MP will run as an independent candidate.
