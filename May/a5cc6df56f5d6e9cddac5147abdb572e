He tricked the detectives to let him go the toilet only to lock the door from inside forcing the officers to drag him out.Senator Stephen Sang had questioned how more than Sh12.5 billion allocated to the county for the past financial years was used. Sang beat the incumbent Cleophas Lagat during last months Jubilee Party nominations.Together with Senator nominee Samson Cherargei, they accused the governor of presiding over a corrupt regime at the expense of service delivery."That is just a tip of the iceberg as what has been going on in Nandi is looting of the highest order. All those involved must be brought to book," Cherargei said.Two days ago, the senator cautioned officials over misuse of county vehicles in the ongoing campaigns.Read: EACC detectives nab three traffic cops soliciting bribes from motorists in EldoretAlso read: EACC recovers Sh17m after raids at Swazuri, senior NLC officials' homes
