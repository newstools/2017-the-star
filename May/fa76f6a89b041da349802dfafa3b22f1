A judge has nullified the law requiring independent presidential candidates to be nominated by individuals who don't belong to any political parties.This means they can be nominated by anyone.Judge George Odunga also nullified a section of the law that requires the aspirants to submit their nomination signatures electronically through Excel.Odunga said on Friday that the requirements go against the constitution and impose unjustifiable restrictions on aspirants.Section 29 (1) of the Elections Act, which was declared unconstitutional by the judge, requires that those nominating independent presidential aspirants should not belong to any party.Odunga's decision arose from a case filed by Peter Gichira.The independent candidates risked being forced to drop their bids as they were supposed to submit 2,000 signatures from at least half of the counties.This meant each one was to submit at least 48,000 signatures from 24 counties as part of the tough demands by law. The demands were meant to weed out jokers.More on this: Independent president hopefuls hopeless?Also read: Eight presidential candidates fail to get enough signatures
