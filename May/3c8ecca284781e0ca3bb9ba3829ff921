NCIC has asked politicians to stop zoning regions perceived to be their strongholds or projecting expected votes for the August election.Chairperson Francis ole Kaparo on Wednesday said the move may send wrong signals leading to anxiety and violence should the outcomes be different."The trend by our political parties, where leaders are dropping numbers like 10 million votes while others are saying they will garner more than this, sets a bad precedent," he stated."Such remarks may result in violence. We cannot afford such. We call upon leaders to issue remarks that do not spike emotions."The National Cohesion and Integration Commission asked party leaders and politicians to let Kenyans make political decisions without being pushed by emotional games."Let's refrain from pushing voters to our camps by playing around with their minds," he stated.Last week, the National Super Alliance projected that it has 10 million votes in its strongholds.In March, National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale said Jubilee will defeat NASA by at least three million votes from Kiambu, Meru and Nakuru.Duale said President Uhuru Kenyatta's party could rest assured of 1.4 million votes in Kiambu, 800,000 in Meru and a million in Nakuru. These add up to 3,200,000 votes.Read: Jubilee will defeat NASA by three million votes - DualeAlso read: Raila to shake up election team in plans for 'mother of all campaigns
