The captor that I hit in the family jewels earlier (and caused all sorts of unimaginable pain to) has let me out of the trunk. He didn&rsquo;t stick around though, just made some cryptic statement and left. Ten minutes later, a short, stout man that I&rsquo;ve never laid eyes on, has walked into the room.&ldquo;Have they hurt you?&rdquo; he wants to know. I have indicated that they have not but he still wants proof.&ldquo;Take off your clothes,&rdquo; he says.I want to shout &ldquo;No!&rdquo; but this time I bite my lip. I say nothing and instead I do as he asks and take off my dress. There&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;m going to be thrown into that trunk again.He inspects my body but there&rsquo;s nothing sexual about his gaze. It&rsquo;s more of how you&rsquo;d view a vase you were purchasing, checking for cracks. He sees a blemish from some weeks back. He frowns but doesn&rsquo;t say anything. Instead he goes to his briefcase and opens it, removing a camera. He starts to take pictures of me. He makes me turn round and pose in different angles as he clicks away. So they want to sell my naked pictures?&ldquo;Will they let me go after this?&rdquo; I ask him.He doesn&rsquo;t respond. He puts the camera back into the briefcase.&ldquo;That blemish on your arm, was it caused by my men?&rdquo; he asks.&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I say recklessly. &ldquo;One of them hurt me when shutting the trunk. Why lock me up like some sort of animal?&rdquo; I ask.&ldquo;Which one was he?&rdquo; he asks.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know his name,&rdquo; I say. &ldquo;Not Bill, the other one.&rdquo;I&rsquo;m not sure why I&rsquo;m lying. Part of me doesn&rsquo;t like the way the other captor was looking at me earlier but the other part mostly wants to find out why it&rsquo;s such a big deal whether I&rsquo;m hurt or not.&ldquo;That&rsquo;s unfortunate, they are not allowed to harm you,&rdquo; he says.&ldquo;Do you mind telling me what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; I ask strangely calm now. I suppose I have the meditation I did earlier to thank for that. &ldquo;I will cooperate with you, I just need to know why I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;&ldquo;Cause and effect Samantha,&rdquo; he says softly.This again. First Bill, now him.&ldquo;Who did I anger?&rdquo; I ask bewildered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s never that serious, surely!&rdquo;&ldquo;Then you have nothing to worry about, do you?&rdquo; he asks.&ldquo;Well&hellip;&rdquo; I say and my voice trails off as I remember the dangerous games I played with GG, the VIP and the Prude. Pretending to be pregnant with their child to extort them off millions. Have the chicken come home to roost? Could it be one of them that has put me in here? What will they do to me? Is the plan to publish my pictures online? Or perhaps also blackmail me in a twisted sense of irony? &ldquo;How does Nabil fit into any of this?&rdquo; I ask. The short man doesn&rsquo;t respond and closes his briefcase.&ldquo;You can get dressed now,&rdquo; he says and with that raps on the door. Someone opens it from the other side and he leaves, locking it behind him. I hear raised voices but I can&rsquo;t make out what is being said. I have a feeling it has something to do with my blemish. He&rsquo;s not very clever that one, can&rsquo;t he tell a fresh scar from an old one? I slowly get dressed and mull over what I&rsquo;ve learned. Someone arranged for me to be kidnapped. One of those men I have blackmailed did this. I&rsquo;m sure of it! I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the Prude. It&rsquo;s either the VIP or GG, and I&rsquo;m leaning towards the former. He&rsquo;s powerful enough to get away with something like this.
