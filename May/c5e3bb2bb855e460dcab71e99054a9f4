Aspiring MPs are promising voters they will pay their dowry and finance their weddings using CDF funds if elected, Haki Africa has said.Executive director Hussein Khalid said the promises have been made to Mombasa, Kwale and Kilifi electorate.&ldquo;The targets are youths who are not yet married or are struggling to pay dowry,&rdquo; he said in a statement on Thursday. He also spoke to The Star by phone.Noting chief campaigners are the ones sending these messages, he said bribery is out of control and that many reports have been made.&ldquo;Corruption is taking centre stage and unfortunately, both voters and leaders are actively engaged,&rdquo; he said, noting a single bribe is of up to Sh5,000.&ldquo;Wananchi are preparing to offer themselves to candidates who pay the most."Read: Voter bribery 'has a big influence' on Kenyan voting patterns &ndash; surveyAlso read: Narok county leads in voter bribery, election offences - reportThe lobby group's boss added that the politicians involved have been cleared by their parties to vie.He also noted citizens are being denied the chance to pick leaders and will not assess leadership potential or capacity to deliver under such circumstances.&ldquo;This is not only illegal but also dangerous as it will not give the best candidate the chance to serve the people and the country,&rdquo; he said.Khalid said the bribes are also in the form of food, livestock, buildings and cars.&ldquo;This is a once-in-five-years opportunity to determine the life and success of our country. Any leader who offers to buy voters is not a good leader. We must rise above poverty and greed for money or property,&rdquo; he said.He added that candidates and the electorate should put the country first.Khalid recommended civic education for everyone, especially in rural areas, as people there believe they must vote for politicians who pay them.The rights group urged the EACC and IEBC to disqualify any candidate found giving bribes.&ldquo;This is a watershed election...we must rise above our differences and elect the best leaders, not the best money,&rdquo; he said.
