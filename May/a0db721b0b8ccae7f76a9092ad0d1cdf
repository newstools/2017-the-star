Last year, Octopizzo introduced his girlfriend on social media, which came as a surprise because many knew he was in a relationship with his baby mama, Christina Fernandes. But that didn't work out.Well, he proposed to his beautiful lass last year and it's only a matter of time before we hear the wedding bells.In an exclusive interview with Kiss FM, he went ahead to reveal that he is getting married in a month's time but wasn't ready to disclose the exact date of the wedding."I got engaged. I'm waiting for the wedding. She even got me a gold spinning ring. We don't have a date but we have a month and we don't want to announce. I'm doing it two ways. I'm not doing the normal church kinda wedding coz I'm not that kinda guy. I want to do it my culture way," he said."So I was in upcountry just before I went to the States and I met all my uncles and asked them how they used to do it back then. I want a cultural wedding, where I pull up on a cow."Octo said he wants his children to look up to him and be happy that their dad followed his roots and held a cultural wedding.Speaking of children, Octo added: "I don't know if I want to talk about that in this specific interview, but I'll do a whole family interview soon, but I have a big family and people should know that. I don't have adopted kids and I'm not like these people wanatokea after two years. The only thing I don't do is, I don't count my eggs before they hatch, so that's why you'll never hear that a shawty is pregnant. When the kid is out, you'll see them and I don't care if I have a hundred baby mamas, but I'm going to own my kids."
