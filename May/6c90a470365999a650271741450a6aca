The Supreme Court has upheld a decision that annulled more than 400 criminal appeals that were disposed of by special courts appointed by former Chief Justice Willy Mutunga in 2013.In a landmark decision, on Friday, the Supreme Court held that judges assigned to special divisions cannot handle criminal cases.The decision means all the criminal appeals that were concluded during the Judicial Service Week between October 14 and 18 should be heard afresh, whether the convictions were upheld or quashed.The mixed benches appointed by Mutunga handled more than 2,000 criminal appeals in a move that was expected to clear backlog of cases.But justices David Maraga (CJ), Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu, Isaac Lenaola, Ibrahim Mohamed, Jackton Ojwang, Njoki Ndung&rsquo;u and Smokin Wanjala said although all judges have power to handle matters filed before them, their status and assignments were limited to their specific terms of employment .The decision arose from appeals filed by violent robbery convicts Karisa Chengo, Jefferson Kalama Khenga and Kitso Charo Ngati. The convicts told the court their cases were compromised, because they were handled by Justice Oscar Angote of the Environment and Land Court and High Court judge Christine Meoli.
