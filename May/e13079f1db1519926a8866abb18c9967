ODM appeals tribunal is embroiled in turf wars with the National Elections Board over handling of petitions filed by various aspirants.The two bodies play a critical role in resolving complaints lodged by aspirants contesting the results of the ODM primaries conducted between April 13 and 30.Yesterday, the Star established the five-member tribunal, chaired by Willis Otieno, had written to the National Executive Council complaining about the conduct of the election officials.Mohammed Hajir, Florence Omose, George Muthama, and Charles Bosire are members of the tribunal, which was formed by the party&rsquo;s NEC to hear petitions arising from primaries.The tribunal is said to be unhappy because NEB deliberately ignored some of its recommendations, including nullifying nominations of some of the party&rsquo;s officials whose victories were challenged.The panel had ruled that some nominations results be declared null and void, and ordered NEB to conduct fresh polls or find a criteria of issuing certificates to those aspirants who were blatantly robbed of victory.&ldquo;We have already filed a formal complaint with the party&rsquo;s top organ that the decisions of this tribunal are being disregarded blatantly, yet we are an independent organ that should arbitrate the complaints,&rdquo; a member of the tribunal who declined to be named told the Star. The claims could not be verified because NEB chairperson, Judy Pareno (pictured), did not answer our calls.
