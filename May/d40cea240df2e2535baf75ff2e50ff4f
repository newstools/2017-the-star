Four men were on Thursday charged with having dangerous weapons in preparation to commit a felony at a polling station. Felix Ondiek, Cleverent Onyonga, Zablon Juma and Kevin Opiyo were accused of having four knives and a panga in circumstances that indicated they wanted to commit a felony. They allegedly committed the offence on April 30 at Old Mathare Primary School polling station in Nairobi. Police said Ondiek was found with two kitchen knives, Onyonga and Juma had a knife each whereas Opiyo had a panga. They said the suspects took advantage of the huge crowd and wanted to cause chaos to steal from people. The accused were chased before the weapons were taken from them. Upon interrogation, they denied intending to cause any commotion and said the weapons were for their own safety. The arresting officers said youths in Mathare area have been using public gatherings and polling stations to steal from voters. "We have heard many cases of goons stealing from people during campaigns and at polling stations especially in Mathare and Kariobangi area," the prosecution said. The four denied the charges before chief magistrate Heston Nyaga and were released on Sh50,000 cash bail each. The case will be mentioned on May 8 when a hearing will be scheduled.
