A Mombasa court yesterday extended orders blocking Jacob Kimutai from taking office as the new CEO at the Coast Water Services Board. Judge Onesmus Makau had issued orders restraining Kimutai from assuming duty, pending the hearing of an application against it. The CWSB had appointed Kimutai to take over from former CEO Joseph Omwange, who has been acting for one year and five months. The order barred the CWSB, agents and staff from installing him as the CEO. But the board said Kimutai had taken office and blamed noncompliance on Omwange. Makau ordered the new CEO be enjoined in the case as an interested party. “The new CEO should be given an opportunity to be part of this matter, as its outcome is going to affect him,” he said. Makau also withdrew a judicial review application made by Abdalla Miraj, who wanted the court to dismiss the appointment, saying it was unfairly done.
