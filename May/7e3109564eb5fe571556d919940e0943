National Assembly majority leader and Garissa Township MP Aden Duale has faulted the IEBC over the distribution of voter registration verification kits in his constituency. He spoke in Garissa town during the graduation ceremony of Madarasa Khadija. Duale criticised the commission’s CEO Ezra Chiloba over the manner in which the kits are distributed in Garissa county. The MP said his constituency has more than 55,000 registered voters but received 25 kits. Neighbouring constituencies like Lagdera and Dadaab that have less than a half his registered voters got 20 kits. “We can see that the CEO is playing games with us. You have an agenda for Garissa Township. I am not happy with the way they are doing things,” Duale said. He added, “They need to come clean and explain how they ended up giving my constituency, which has the highest number of registered voters in Northeastern, such a small number of kits.” Duale said he will write to the commission to get answers from the chairman himself. He said the verification is within the law and he has no problem with that. Duale said he is confident of retaining his seat. “I know that more than 54,000, out of the 55,000, are my voters. That is why my opponents are busy roaming the streets of Nairobi but cannot come to the ground because it is as if they have already lost,” he said. Duale will face Farah Maalim (Wiper), Nasir Dolal (ODM) and Abdi Yare of ANC.
