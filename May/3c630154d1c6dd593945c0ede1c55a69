Eight security officers were killed yesterday in two separate bomb attacks in Garissa and Mandera counties.Five officers in Governor Ali Roba&rsquo;s convoy were killed when their Land Cruiser ran over an improvised explosive device between Arabia and Lafey in Mandera. An unknown number of people were injured in the explosion.The governor was on the campaign trail when the car leading his convoy was blown up. In Garissa, three AP officers were killed in the morning and five others injured when their vehicle ran over an IED on the Kulan-Liboi road, seven kilometres from Kulan, Garissa county.Two of the injured are in critical condition. The slain officers are Khalif Yerrow, Abdikadir Osman and Issack Durrow.The eight officers, based at Kulan patrol base, were travelling to Liboi on official duty at 6.30am. Their Land Cruiser was extensively damaged.Three of the injured were flown to Nairobi for specialised treatment and the bodies were also airlifted to Nairobi.Northeastern regional coordinator Mohamud Saleh linked the incident to al Shabaab militants, whom he said were frustrated after government security agencies tightened security along the border.&ldquo;The militants have found it difficult to carry out attacks as they used to do because all the entry points along the border have been closed. They have now resorted to planting IEDs on selected roads just to target our security officers,&rdquo; he said.On May 16, a miraa vehicle was blown up by an IED on the same route, killing all the four occupants on board, among them a one-year-old baby.Saleh said the target was a police vehicle that had passed just 10 minutes before the civilian vehicle.&ldquo;We suspect that some unscrupulous local businessmen, who have been raking in a lot of profits, are working with al Shabaab to sabotage the reopening of the [Liboi] border by portraying the main road to the border as unsafe,&rdquo; Saleh said.
