Some traders in Kitale town have opposed the commissioning of the bus park and business centre as they are still under construction.Speaking during a meeting with county officials at the weekend, they said commissioning incomplete work will hurt their businesses.They want the business centre completed and the whole project commissioned at the same time.Trans Nzoia Governor Patrick Khaemba had announced that the bus park section, which is complete, will be commissioned as the contractor proceeds to complete the business centre.Matatu Owners Association chairman in Trans Nzoia, Mathews Njoroge, said they depend on traders and opening the bus park only will keep traders outside, hence hurt the matatu business.Fish mongers chairperson Grace Ahau said traders at the bus park entrance will be displaced.Transport executive Wycliffe Kiiya urged the traders to provide a solution on how the county government can help in addressing the challenges they face so the bus park can be commissioned.
