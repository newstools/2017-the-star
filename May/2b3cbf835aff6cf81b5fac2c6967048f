ODM will repeat nominations for Suba MP on Wednesday, the party's National Elections Board said on Tuesday.This was after the High Court ordered a repeat of the exercise at seven polling stations.In a statement, NEB chairperson Judith Pareno said voting will kick off at 6am and end at 5pm.This will be at Oma, God Oloo, Koga, Mikuyu, Miriya, Kiembe and Nyakiya primary schools.Aspirant Caroli Omondi's appeal against the fresh nominations was defeated.The High Court dismissed the application on grounds it lacked merit and that the tribunal was within law to call fresh polls.Omondi, who is party leader Raila Odinga's former aide, filed the appeal last Monday after incumbent John Mbadi was declared winner of the April 24 ODM nominations.The politician was dissatisfied with the order which required ODM to hold fresh polls within 72 hours from Friday last week.He argued that the tribunal erred in law by staging polls in the seven polling stations.But ODM, through lawyer Anthony Oluoch and Tom Kajwang, accused Omondi of introducing fresh claims in the appeal.They further argued that the court had no jurisdiction to hear petitions arising from the tribunal.Read: ODM directed to withdraw Obado, Ayacko and Mbadi certificatesAlso read: Tribunal nullifies Mbadi's Suba MP nominations win, orders repeat
