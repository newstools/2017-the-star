President Uhuru Kenyatta is set to unveil his Presidential campaign teams next week.The President is preparing to launch an aggressive reelection campaign following the end of the nominations.In the run-up to 2013 General Election, Uhuru ran what appeared to be a well-oiled and managed campaign that involved local and international experts.Tomorrow, Jubilee Party delegates from across the country will endorse the President at Bomas of Kenya to seek a second term in office.JP has invited all its sitting governors, members of the National Assembly, senators, Woman representatives and MCAs, all nominated aspirants, members of the party's National Governing Council and the 19 interim officials from the 47 counties. Yesterday Majority Leader Aden Duale said the coming together of the leaders tomorrow is part of the larger Uhuru reelection plan that will precede the launch of the official campaigns.&ldquo;JP is a national party with clear agenda for Kenyans. All of us are ready to ensure that the Jubilee Government is reelected in August. No youth, women and men, professionals and politicians who have ideas will be locked out,&rdquo; Duale said.According to sources in the Presidency, the teams have been divided into six core units that will each play a role in seeking votes and popularising the President.The units comprise Technical/Resources; Strategy and Theme Advisers; Political; Professionals; Communication and Messaging; and the Women and Youth grassroots caucuses. Technical/Resources is largely made up of Uhuru's family members and those from Deputy President William Ruto's inner circle.They include Uhuru's Private Secretary Jomo Gecaga, former State House political adviser Nancy Gitau, Uhuru&rsquo;s maternal uncle and former Kenya Airports Authority managing director George Muhoho, Solicitor General Njee Muturi, former MP David Murathe, National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi and his Senate counterpart Ekwee Ethuro. Other members are the DP's Private Secretary David Maiyo, Energy CS Charles Keter, aide Farouk Kibet and former Energy CS Davis Chirchir.The team is directly supervised by Uhuru's younger brother Muhoho Kenyatta, who is answerable to the President and the DP.The Strategy and Theme unit will be made up of key political think-tank operatives comprising university lecturers and businesspeople. They will manage all aspects of the UhuRuto campaigns, from raising funds to re-aligning the Jubilee Manifesto.The Professional teams will be largely based in the counties and their work will be to explain and sell the Jubilee agenda among their respective communities.This unit will be coordinated by Cabinet Secretaries and Principal Secretaries. They will meet every two weeks to review progress and challenges.The Communications and Messaging team will be charged with the responsibility of ensuring there is relevant and timely content online.The team will work hand-in-hand with the British PR firm BTP Advisers, which has been contracted again to handle UhuRuto&rsquo;s image both locally and internationally. BTP played a major role in Uhuru's 2013 win. The firm was also part of the team that conceptualised the creation of the now-defunct TNA, including its launch in May 2012 that was done amid pomp and colour.The Women and Youth caucuses will run the &ldquo;Uhuru Tena&rdquo; campaigns in the counties and subcounties. Most of the coordination will be done at the county level, but some elements will be done at national level, directly supervised by the Technical/Resources unit.On the Political unit front, Uhuru and Ruto are expected to reinstate the team of politicians that had been disbanded pending the primaries.All the winners of the JP ticket and losers who have opted to stick with the party will form teams in their respective counties that will campaign for Uhuru.It is understood that a deal has been offered to the losers to stick with the party and be rewarded with state jobs after the election.Duale and Eldas MP Adan Keynan will be among those who will lead the campaigns in Northeastern, while all the successful aspirants from Central will campaign as a team in Mt Kenya.At the Coast, Taveta MP Naomi Shaban, Kwale County Woman Rep Zainab Chidzuga, Kilifi North MP Gideon Mung&rsquo;aro and Mombasa governor hopeful Suleiman Shahbal will be in a group responsible for the President&rsquo;s grand campaign team in a region perceived to be a NASA stronghold.Bungoma Governor Ken Lusaka, Mumias East MP Benjamin Washiali and Teso South MP Mary Emase will take charge of the Western bloc. Charles Nyachae, Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi, nominated Senator Joy Gwendo and Kisii Senator Chris Obure will team up with other campaigners to popularise UhuRuto in the larger Nyanza region.Meru Senator Kiraitu Murungi, Senate Majority Leader Kithure Kindiki, Regina Ndambuki, Rachel Nyamai, Kalembe Ndile and Tiya Galgalo and all the nominated aspirants will be in charge of the Eastern region.The expansive Rift Valley region will be represented by Deputy Speaker Joyce Laboso, Turkana Senator John Munyes, Nakuru County Speaker Susan Kihika, Narok Governor Samuel Tunai, and nominated aspirants from the Kajiado and Samburu counties.Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko, Woman Rep Rachel Shebesh, Nominated Senator Beatrice Elachi, and Nominated MP Johnson Sakaja, among others, will be responsible for the city.
