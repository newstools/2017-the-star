More women aspirants have positioned themselves to fight for top seats in Nakuru.During the primaries many women edged out their male counterparts.In 2013, fewer women ran for election, compared with those running this year.Nakuru speaker Susan Kihika (pictured) won the Jubilee primaries to run for Senate. Others are Naivasha MP Jubilee nominee Jayne Kihara, nominated Senator Martha Wangari (Gilgil) and Charity Chepkwony (Njoro). Most of the women complained of intimidation by men and lack of funding.The women, however, have intensified their campaigns to overcome the odds they faced in the 2013 polls and in the Jubilee Party nominations. Kihika, the daughter of former MP Kihika Kimani, defeated eight men, including veteran politician and former Subukia MP Koigi Wamwere.
