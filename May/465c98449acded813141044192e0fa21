The Council of Governors has denied claims it has received money intended to pay doctors for the entire period they were on strike. Thousands of doctors working in Kenya&rsquo;s public hospitals on March 15 ended a 100-day strike after reaching a deal with the government. Health CS Cleopa Mailu on Monday said the National Treasury released the money and disbursed it to respective counties.The CoG now wants Mailu to announce disbursements for each county government and dates they were made as he alleged through the media.&ldquo;The Council of Governors seeks to know from the Cabinet Secretary, Ministry of Health, under what provisions of the law did the ministry purport to disburse the monies to the county governments without the Senate&rsquo;s approval,&rdquo; reads their statement.The CoG, however, said the national government committed to provide the county governments with money to increase allowances awarded to medics for six months, from January 2017 to June 2017.In a press release to newsrooms, the council claims the money budgeted for nurses, clinical officers and other health workers in the counties as allowances, amounted to Sh1.6 billion and the doctors&rsquo; is Sh1.5 billion. The amount has not been disbursed, it indicates.
