A widow yesterday lost a 10-year legal battle over the ownership of a multimillion-shilling property in Woodley, Nairobi.In a judgment, Court of Appeal judges agreed with a decision made by the High Court that the property to which Grace Wairimu stakes a claim belongs to someone else.Wairimu is required to vacate the land on Joseph Kang&rsquo;ethe Road.In addition, the businesswoman is required to pay Sh100,000 to Chaka Ltd as nominal damages for trespass.According to documents, Wairimu&rsquo;s husband, Francis Sorora, filed the suit against the defunct Nairobi City Council on July 19, 2007, claiming ownership.Sorora, the son of former minister Stanley Oloitiptip, died before the case was heard and determined. Chaka Ltd was later listed as a party in the suit.Wairimu had wanted to be declared the rightful owner by adverse possession on the basis that she had occupied the land for more than 12 years.She had told the court she was threatened with eviction and was afraid Zam Zam Bar would be destroyed.Wairimu said she, together with her husband, acquired the land in 1981.Justice Pauline Nyamweya, who initially handled the dispute, held that the documentary evidence produced by Wairimu was forged. She ordered Wairimu to leave the property to its rightful owners.The judge also ruled that the Sororas started living on the plot in 1985, but other squatters invaded the land in 1995.The case was dismissed in 2010. Wairimu appealed, having been aggrieved by the decision.The Court of Appeal has now upheld Justice Nyamweya&rsquo;s findings that the land was originally registered in the name of Kibicho Ltd in March 1983.The property was immediately charged to the collapsed Pan Africa Credit and Finance to secure a Sh4 million loan that was never repaid.The property was sold to Chaka Ltd in exercise of the bank&rsquo;s statutory power of sale.Judges Alnashir Visram, Martha Koome and Jamilla Mohamed held that Sorora entered the property with the permission of the council in a letter dated August 20, 1985.&ldquo;The role played by the council as a local authority did not help Wairimu&rsquo;s case because she was merely licensed to carry out business,&rdquo; they said in the ruling.They added, &ldquo;In our view, that did not give rise to a claim of ownership of the land.&rdquo;
