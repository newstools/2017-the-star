The NASA campaign structure will create confusion and give room for Jubilee to win, Navakholo MP Emmanuel Wangwe has said.Speaking to the Star on the phone yesterday, he said the team unveiled last week to lead presidential candidate Raila Odinga&rsquo;s campaigns will not achieve much.&ldquo;It is interesting that Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya is coordinating the campaigns in Western, where he has some of his fiercest rivals. How is he going to work with Boni Khalwale, with whom he does not see eye-to-eye?&rdquo; Wangwe asked.He continued, &ldquo;Oparanya will definitely coordinate ODM campaigns and not those of NASA. This is because he is under intense pressure from Khalwale, who wants to unseat him.&rdquo;Wangwe said the naming of ANC leader and NASA founder Musalia Mudavadi as the head of Raila&rsquo;s campaigns nationally was meant to divert his attention from ensuring his party wins seats.He said that Raila was only making Mudavadi his point man nationally.Ford Kenya leader and NASA co-principal Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula and ANC Western coordinator Major Malala said they will only campaign for Raila for President, but will ensure their parties win other seats against ODM.Malala and Likuyani MP Enoch Kibunguchy last week asked ODM to leave key county seats to ANC and Ford Kenya in the spirit of negotiated democracy and coalition building.Wangwe said Mudavadi will have a rough time selling a Raila candidature to Luhyas because the opposition candidate will appear on the ballot as ODM, not NASA.&ldquo;How is he going to convince the community that he has not defected to ODM?&rdquo; he asked.Wangwe accused the opposition of attempting to zone the country for political support.He described the Saturday incident where NASA supporters attacked Jubilee supporters who attended a party function in Mumias town as primitive.&ldquo;Let them campaign on the platform of ideologies and tell Kenyans why they want to be given power, instead of trying to force residents to back them,&rdquo; he said.Wangwe said the absence of Ikolomani MP Bernard Shinali and his Matungu counterpart David Were from the Jubilee function presided over by Deputy President William Ruto in Mumias on Saturday should not be misconstrued to mean there is a division within Jubilee.Shinali and Were&rsquo;s failure to attend the function in Mumias town, where Ruto handed nomination certificates to candidates, fuelled speculation of an imminent split in the Jubilee family in Kakameega county.Raila is expected to formally launch his campaign on June 3, two days after Uhuru starts his Jubilee reelection drive.During campaigns, Mudavadi will be supported by a secretariat and smaller teams of regional leaders, mostly governors.Norman Magaya, former head of the Cord secretariat, will be the campaign&rsquo;s executive director.Mudavadi will report directly to the Pentagon, including Raila, Wiper&rsquo;s Kalonzo Musyoka, Wetang&rsquo;ula and Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto of CCM.Experts including distinguished economist David Ndii and Abubakar Zein of the East African Legislative Assembly will support the Pentagon.Under the regional chiefs will be county coordinators, constituency coordinators and polling station managers. In total, Raila will have about 500 mainly young people and experts working on his campaign countrywide.According to multiple sources, most team members will be based in the counties and report to their coordinators and regional team leaders. Key members of the team will be in place by the end of this month.
