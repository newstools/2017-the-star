A lobby group aiming to get the President at least 350,000 votes in Ukambani will not meet its target, Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana has said.The team is of professionals from the three counties in the region - Makueni, Machakos and Kitui.It includes former allies of NASA vice president candidate and Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka. Its leader isMusili Wambua, Kalonzo' former partner at the defunct Musyoka Wambua &amp; Katiku Advocates.Musili, who is chairman of WONI Initiative, told the Star in Nairobi on Thursday that Jubilee only got 89,064 votes from the region in 2013.But he and others in the group noted this will not be the case this time round as Jubilee has ensured development.Kibwana said on Thursday that President Uhuru Kenyatta's supporters will "yield nothing" as the Kamba have lost trust in the ruling Jubilee Party.&ldquo;They will not succeed because the people are against Uhuru&rsquo;s government. The projects they were promised were not implemented,&rdquo; he said in an interview with The Star.He cited Thwake dam and Konza Techno city projects which have stalled.The Governor said the community is fully behind NASA and that Wiper rebels will not add any value and will be voted out on August 8.&ldquo;Our people are tired of selfish leaders. They have said they want to speak with one voice and vote for leaders who will honour their pledges."More on this: We are not in Jubilee Party by mistake, Ukambani MPS sayAlso read: Seven Ukambani rebels given week to choose Wiper or JubileeBut Mbooni MP Kisoi Munyao dismissed Kibwana&rsquo;s sentiments as misplaced and misleading.Munyao defended the Jubilee administration saying it has mplemented many projects through the County Development Fund.He noted the funds MPs get for renovating and building schools and administration offices and bursaries were from the national government.The Wiper rebel exuded confidence that he will be re-elected and that Jubilee will fetch enough votes from the region to give Uhuru a sure win in August.&ldquo;Anyone saying Ukambani is a NASA zone is lying to himself,&rdquo; he told The Star by phone today.He added that Ukambani leaders were more divided than ever after the Emali declaration that was aimed at bringing them together.&ldquo;When he (Kibwana) assembled leaders at Emali, he assured the people he will take charge in NASA negotiations for Kalonzo to be named flag bearer.
