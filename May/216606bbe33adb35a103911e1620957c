The story of David and Goliath in the Bible motivated me to run for Murang&rsquo;a senate, says Kiharu MP Irungu Kang&rsquo;ata.The first-time MP said the Bible, his favourite book, made him conquer the &lsquo;underdog&rsquo; mentality, which made him trounce incumbent Kembi Gitura in the Jubilee Party primaries.&ldquo;I have read the story many times and it gives me hope that even the smallest or weakest of us have a chance to leave a mark. And that is what I pray for,&rdquo; the MP said. Speaking to the Star on Friday, the lawmaker said he has always ensured the needs of the people come first.&ldquo;I thought of becoming Murang&rsquo;a senator after I realised that I have more to offer to the larger county after serving my people for five years in Kijaru. And I thank God that I clinched the Jubilee ticket,&rdquo; Kang&rsquo;ata said. Kang&rsquo;ata beat Gitura by more than 10,000 and garnered 158,164 votes against his rival&rsquo;s 146,207. The MP has been vocal in the fight against corruption and has been pushing for fairness and good governance.&ldquo;I also do not advocate for politics in church because that is where we go to worship,&rdquo; he said&ldquo;I have been voted as one of the top performing MPs serving the common mwananchi is my calling.&rdquo;
