The Nairobi county government was yesterday dealt a blow in its quest to control billions of shillings in the betting and gaming industry.Justice Isaac Lenaola suspended the operation of the Nairobi City County, Betting, Lotteries and Gaming Act for 60 days, denying the government the right to collect tax from gaming firms.&ldquo;The operation of the county&rsquo;s Betting, Lotteries and Gaming Act shall remain suspended to enable compliance with the requirement for its gazettement,&rdquo; the judge said.Lenaola said failure to comply with the guidelines set by the Transition Authority concerning the licenses, the Act shall be deemed unlawful. In November last year, the judge suspended the Act, saying the county passed it without awaiting the outcome of processes put in place by the TA. In a judgement read by Justice Chacha Mwita, Lenaola said because betting, lotteries and gaming are concurrent functions of both the national and county government, those functions should be demarcated according to the terms set by the TA.The Association of Gaming Operators, Africa Rafiki and Wycliffe Indalu moved to court to stop the demand for taxes under the new Act.
