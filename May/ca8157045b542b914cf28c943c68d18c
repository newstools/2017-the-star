Ol Kalou MP David Kiaraho was criticised yesterday for harassing a journalist who tried to cover his bursary distribution in Muiri village, Kagaa location, on Monday.Kiaraho (pictured) was awarding bursary cheques to residents of Karau and Kaimbaga wards at Muiri Primary School. The Star reporter Ndichu Wainaina was prevented from taking photos. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be photographed. Stop it! Those are the photos you give out,&rdquo; he saidKiaraho accused the media giving photos or cheque distribution to rivals, who then say he is bribing voters.But pastor David Kiugu of the Levitical Fellowship said Kiaraho is employed by the people who deserve the right to know what he is doing. &ldquo;Rising against journalists is very shameful,&rdquo; he said. Similar sentiments were shared by Bishop Francis Karara and former Nyandarua ICT chief officer Wilson Kigwa.
