She would turn in her grave," he said during a national prayer meeting in Nairobi on Thursday. But the MP said the nominations were shambolic and that " forces of evil do not want us around".

"T here are people who are planning ahead. Independents, especially&nbsp;from Nyanza and Western, are '100 per cent Raila&nbsp;supporters'." Midiwo had warned ODM that the skewed outcomes of the primaries might hurt Raila&rsquo;s bid. &nbsp;&nbsp;
