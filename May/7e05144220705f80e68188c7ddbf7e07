Imenti Central MP Gideon Mwiti on Friday urged a Nairobi court to terminate his rape case on grounds the charge sheet is defective. The legislator, through his lawyer John Khaminwa, told trial magistrate Francis Andayi of the Milimani court, that the charges levelled against him by the state are defective and should be terminated. Khaminwa told the court he wishes to adopt his submissions he filed asking the court not to waste judicial time with the “defective” charges. But the prosecution opposed the defence application, and instead asked the court to tell the prosecution to amend the charge before the hearing. The magistrate will deliver his ruling on whether to terminate the charges on June 13. Mwiti is faces charges of rape, assault and intimidation. He was accused of raping a woman on March 21, 2015 at Tana Club along Woodvale Grove in Westlands, Nairobi, but he denies the charges. The politician is charged alongside a medical practitioner “Dr” David Muchiri, who allegedly conducted an involuntary HIV test on the complainant whose identity cannot be revealed for legal reasons.
