Primary and pre-primary school teachers&rsquo; colleges will be required to offer special needs subjects to teachers once the proposed curriculum is rolled out. Every teacher joining college will be trained on special needs, according to a draft framework for teacher education, which, once approved, will guide teacher training in colleges. The proposed curriculum also seeks to raise the status of teachers. They will have to pursue diploma courses as minimum qualification, as opposed to the current certificate courses. Minimum qualification for admission to the programmes will be at least a C-plus score in the KSCE exam. The new guideline is expected to improve the depth of knowledge among graduates teaching in primary schools. The curriculum also seeks to review examinations offered to special need students.
