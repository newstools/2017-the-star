A lobby group from Nyanza has asked ODM to nominate former Raila Odinga’s aide Silas Jakakimba for consideration in the East African Legislative Assembly. Young Nyanza Professionals says Jakakimba  is qualified for the position. Group’s secretary general John Odula said Jakakimba also represents youths, who are marginalised, and the party should accommodate him. “He also comes from the Suba community, which is small in Luo,” Odula said. Speaking to journalists in Homa Bay town yesterday, Odula said Jakakimba’s nomination will prove that ODM can appoint youths in leadership positions. He  said Jakakimba’s appointment will attract votes from young people as the  country heads to the general election  on August 8. Chairman Jeff Adero said Jakakimba is loyal to ODM and should replace Joseph Kiangoi  who decamped to Jubilee Party. “Further, both come from Nyanza for regional balancing,” Odula said. Parliament asked ODM to forward more names for EALA posts.
