KCB Group posted an after tax profit of Sh4.54 billion during the first quarter of the year, an 8.35 per cent rise from Sh4.19 billion during the same period in 2016.The lender attributed the slow growth to the impact of interest rates in a tough economic environment coupled with hyper-inflation in South Sudan.&ldquo;We have witnessed an increasingly challenging operating environment across all markets. In Kenya, the interest rate caps have made it difficult to price for risk whereas some of our subsidiaries are experiencing high inflation and shortage of foreign currency,&rdquo; KCB Group chief executive Joshua Oigara said in a statement.Oigara said that the continued depreciation of South Sudan&rsquo;s currency has negatively impacted the Group&rsquo;s results adding that appropriate measures are being executed as the lender will continues to monitor the country&rsquo;s overall performance.Net interest income declined marginally by 0.86 per cent to Sh10.34 billion in the first quarter of 2017 from Sh10.43 billion the previous year. Loans to customers rose by 26.33 per cent to Sh395.49 billion from Sh313.05 billion in the first quarter of 2016.KCB Group&rsquo;s non-interest income currently accounts for 35 per cent of the Group&rsquo;s total operating income and is expected to be the growth driver going forward. The Group has pegged its future on its Fintech strategy that rides on a digital platform to provide services for its customers.&ldquo;The future lies in leveraging technology to drive efficiencies in our operations in order to serve our customers better with relevant products that meet their expectations,&rdquo; Oigara said.The bank is targeting to reach more than 15 million mobile banking customers and increase its agency network to over 20,000 agents.
