The National Super Alliance has announced an ambitious plan to narrow political rifts among hopefuls created by cut-throat competition for party tickets.The Star yesterday established that the alliance has stepped up reconciliation efforts to have fierce rivals close ranks to avoid hurting presidential campaigns.Coalition management co-chairpersons have been instructed by the principals to harmonise lists of aspirants from 12 counties considered battle grounds for the five affiliates.This is meant to build consensus to field joint candidates for NASA in swing counties to avoid splitting votes and giving Jubilee candidates an edge.The counties include Bungoma, Busia, Kisii, Machakos, Mombasa, Nairobi, Nakuru, Narok, Nyamira, Tana River, Turkana and Kwale.Also in the works is a strategy to give losers considered strong and popular state jobs in the NASA administration if it wins the August election.The plan will eliminate friction and boost unity, which is crucial for victory.Secretaries general of affiliate parties have been instructed to form coordination teams to work closely with grassroots committees to reconcile rivals.This is to be concluded before parties submit their lists of candidates to the IEBC on Wednesday.The decision is informed by the fact that losers at the primaries could pose a major political headache for NASA after most of them decided to run as independents, claiming they were rigged out.Presidential campaignsNASA co-principal Kalonzo Musyoka on Friday gave the clearest indication that the alliance was jittery and unless the losers are reconciled with the winners, presidential campaigns may be hurt.He said NASA will form reconciliation committees in all the constituencies, where it is fielding candidates, to heal the wounds and forge unity.&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s understand that even friendly fire kills. We should make sure we don&rsquo;t make mistakes. Arrogance will be costly,&rdquo; the Wiper leader warned.&ldquo;If you believe in change, then you shouldn&rsquo;t go independent. If you do, it means you were not interested in the vision in the first place.&rdquo;ODM faces the biggest dilemma on how to deal with independent candidates in its Nyanza bastion.This follows massive resignations from the party by hundreds of aspirants, who are determined to face off with their opponents at the ballot.This may puncture Raila&rsquo;s presidential campaigns as it did in 2013, when some losers ditched the Orange party for Cord affiliates over rigging claims.Some emerged victorious in the March 4, 2013 general election.Kalonzo told ODM that the rest of the NASA family expects much from it, given that its leader is the joint presidential candidate.He said, &ldquo;To whom much is given, much will be expected. It&rsquo;ll be about serious planning with precision. There is no room for mistakes this time round.&rdquo;
