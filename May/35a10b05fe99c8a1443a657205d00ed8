Lands CS Jacob Kaimenyi on Friday made a surprise visit to the Embu Land&rsquo;s office and found almost half of the staff absent and several other irregularities. Kaimenyi, who opened an international workshop for scouts in Embu town in the morning, stormed the Lands office afterwards.Branch registrar Richard Munguti, who was found supervising the skeleton staff, was at a loss to explain the situation.He addressed him as &lsquo;your honour&rsquo; until the minister told him to address his as Kaimenyi.The CS inspected several offices and found broken-down computers.Some officers were using typewriters, the office had no internet connection, the seats were torn, receipts were stored in a haphazard manner and several officers had been stationed there for more than six years.Officers did not have badges to identify themselves and had no copies of laws on land matters for reference.Kaimenyi expressed concern the office did not have copies of the Land Amendment Act, 2016, and the Community Land Act, 2016 and wondered how they were working.Some clients seeking services at the office took advantage of Kaimenyi&rsquo;s visit to complain about how they had been denied services. The CS told the staff to follow up on complaints.
