Governor Alex Tolgos has said he dropped Deputy Governor Gabriel Lamaon as his running mate due to public pressure.&ldquo;Residents of Elgeyo Marakwet told me that this time I should give the position to someone from a different area and that is why we decided to make the changes,&rdquo; he told journalists in Iten town on Friday.Tolgos on Friday will unveil Wesley Rotich, 28, as his new running mate.He did not give any other explanation for dropping Lamaon, but sources said the deputy governor paid the price of failing to deliver votes for the governor during the Jubilee primaries.&ldquo;We are working as a team and no ill motives were intended in the changes,&rdquo; Tolgos said.He won the Jubilee Party ticket.Lamaon last week said he is not bitter after he was dropped.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t consider the sacking a disappointment. I have worked with Governor Tolgos well and will continue to support him,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;I take the decision in good faith and will offer support to ensure that the governor is reelected. I will still serve as deputy until when I hand over after elections.&rdquo;
