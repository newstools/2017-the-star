The government will roll out free HIV self-testing kits to screen close to 400,000 Kenyans who do not know their HIV status in July.This move puts Kenya once again in the global map as it will be the first country in the world to introduce the kits to the market. The kits will cost about Sh800 over the counter.Studies done on self-testing kits have shown that results are 80 per cent effective.&ldquo;Once you take the test at home ensure you go to a health facility to confirm your results,&rdquo; Head of NASCOP Martin Sirengo said yesterday.He spoke during the national roll-out of the Pre-exposure prophylaxis drug, an oral drug used to prevent HIV infection.The HIV self-testing (HIVST) refers to a process in which a person collects his or her own specimen (oral fluid or blood) and then performs a HIV test and interprets the result.The blood test will give the results immediately, while the oral swab will give the results after 20 minutes. &ldquo;It should be done in a private setting, either alone or with someone he or she trusts. The primary goal of these HIV self-testing is to better support and complement other existing HIV testing approaches in order to reach people who may not otherwise test,&rdquo; WHO representative to Kenya Rudolf Eggers said.Close to 1.5 million people are living with HIV in Kenya out of which nearly one million are on lifelong treatment.The self-testing kits come in the wake of a new measure that has been introduced to reduce infections.Data from the Aids progress report shows that Kenya recorded 77,000 new infections in 2015. The prevention measure known as PrEP involves taking the drug orally daily.The drug would cost about Sh600 per month and Sh6,000 annually in private health facilities.PrEP is said to be 96 per cent effective in reducing new HIV infections.It is supposed to be taken by people who are at a higher risk of contracting HIV, including discordant couples where one partner is HIV-positive and the other is negative.Others eligible for the treatment are individuals who do not use condoms, those who frequently contract STIs, those who have multiple sexual partners, drug users who share syringes and people who frequently use post-exposure prophylaxis even though they are HIV-negative.Kenya is the second country in Africa, after South Africa, to rollout PrEP.Users of PrEP are advised to practise safe sex.
