Property worth millions of shillings went up in flames after fire gutted a dormitory at Koimbi Boys’ High School in Murang’a county on Sunday. No student was hurt. The fire started at 7.30pm. Students were in class for their evening preps. Principal John Muthee said the teacher on duty noticed smoke billowing out of the dormitory and raised the alarm. “We immediately informed our students, who assisted in putting out the fire,” he said. Uniforms, bedding and other personal effects belonging to 82 students were destroyed. Muthee said, “Our main challenge now is finding a place for these students to sleep without disrupting their learning.” He said he suspects the fire was caused by an electric fault, but added police officers will investigate. Board of management chairman Francis Gacheru appealed to the government, well-wishers and stakeholders to help rebuild the dormitory. “We are too close to the national examinations and we do not want our students’ learning time to be disrupted,” Muthee said.
