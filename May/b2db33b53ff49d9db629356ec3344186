Enock Onsase, prime suspect in the killing of the three children of Kapsoya Kanu MCA aspirant James Ratemo, appeared in Eldoret court yesterday. Onsase, the children’s uncle, was not charged with murder after the prosecution asked for 10 days to complete investigations. “I am innocent and I have not been told who saw me with the children as claimed,” Onsase said, though he could not yet enter a formal plea. Chief magistrate Charles Obulutsa granted the prosecution more time and remanded Onsase. Clifford Nyamweya ( 7 ), Dan Nyamweya ( 5 ) and Glen Ongaki ( 3 ) were reported missing on May 13, and their bodies later recovered from River Nzoia on Friday. The motive has not been determined, though there has been speculation about politics, a family feud and land dispute. Onsase asked the court for his mobile phone but Obulutsa said it was evidence and the suspect should be assisted by the police ifi he wants to communicate. The accused also asked the court to order that he should not be handcuffed while in the cells. State counsel Zachary Omwenga told the court they needed time to complete the probe in Eldoret and Trans Nzoia, where the bodies of the three children were found. “This is a serious matter of public interest, involving children who enjoy protection under the Constitution. We need time to carry out thorough investigations. We even have to get mobile phone data from Nairobi as part of the investigations,” Omwenga said. Obulutsa ruled that Onsase should be produced in court on June 6, when the abduction charges he was facing will be substituted with murder. Witnesses have claimed they saw the three murdered children with Onsase in Eldoret town moments after they were abducted.s
