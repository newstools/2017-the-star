After failing in his ambitious attempt to beat three-time world 1500m champion Asbel Kiprop, Jacob Kosgei returns to the Kipchoge Keino Stadium this morning during the World U18 pre-trials.Kosgei almost floored his experienced training mate in the 1,500m final during Athletics Kenya track and field meeting last weekend and will be counting on that feat to impress again today.The 17-year old, who is also Asbel&rsquo;s village-mate from Simat, clocked 3:46.00 for third position during the encounter and remains confident of making the team for the global showpiece in Nairobi in July .&ldquo;This is my first year running in the U18 rank and I am very hopeful of exemplary performance,&rdquo; said Kosgei, who finished seventh in the 1,500m finals at the Mumias AK meet.Asbel lauded the youngster, praising his discipline during training and predicted a bright future for a runner, who could probably be his heir in the future.&ldquo;We need young talents to follow in our footsteps and I am happy that Kosgei is very competitive,&rdquo; Asbel said.Rift Valley Secondary School 1,500m champion Justus Kiplagat from Kirobon High School will also be in the line up after shining at the schools championships held at the same venue last week.&ldquo;I have won some races while in primary and secondary schools and this time I am targeting to represent Kenya at the world under 18 event. I hope to make the cut to the national trials,&rdquo; Kiplagat said.His school-mate, David Kabirante, will compete in the 400m as Torongo Camp&rsquo;s Geoffrey Rono and Cleophas Kandie battle for honours in the 2000m steeplechase. Lydia Cheruto will compete in 800m race.AK youth sub-Committee chairman, Barnabas Kitilit, said athletes with impressive times will be selected for the national trials.&ldquo;Every region will bring their athletes and we will pick at least eight per discipline depending on their performance. They will then be invited for the trials where the final team will be picked,&rdquo; said Kitilit. Kenya finished second in the previous World Youth championships held in Cali Colombia behind United States of America.
