Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko is a comedian who cannot run the city, ODM politicians have said.The Jubilee nominee does not have the moral authority and standing to run for the top job, they said.&ldquo;We cannot accept Nairobi to be controlled by a comedian. We need a credible leader who will be able to address issues city residents face,&rdquo; ODM Starehe MP aspirant Steve Mbogo said.Embakasi South MP Irshadali Sumra said all NASA aspirants in Nairobi will back Governor Evans Kidero&rsquo;s reelection. &ldquo;During the 2013 elections, we only voted for Mike Sonko because we thought he would make for a good senator. This year people will not vote for someone who deals with goons,&rdquo; he said.Senator aspirant Edwin Sifuna referred to Sonko as a poor manager, saying businesses would suffer if he is elected. &ldquo;If we allow Sonko to take over, hawkers will flood the city, which will be bad for business,&rdquo; he said.The leaders spoke on Sunday in Ngara at a meeting with more than 500 members of the Muslim business community. Kidero was at the meeting.
