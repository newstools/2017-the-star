Three candidates will do battle for the Homa Bay governor&rsquo;s seat in the August 8 election.Governor Cyprian Awiti was awarded the ODM ticket amid rigging allegations and court battles. The main battle is expected between Awiti and Magwanga.Awiti will face his main rival Oyugi Magwanga and politician Omedo Misama, both independent candidates.&ldquo;We want to appeal to our party leader Raila Odinga to feel safe about his votes from Homa Bay and concentrate much in looking for more votes from other regions,&rdquo; Misama said.He said Raila should leave Homa Bay residents to vote for leaders of their choice.&ldquo;This time no one will hang on Baba&rsquo;s coat. Let all of them face the voters.&rdquo;Magwanga has said he will support the NASA flagbearer for the presidency.&ldquo;The nomination was messed up by party officials who were appointed to preside over it from the county up to the national level. That is why I have decided to vie as an independent candidate,&rdquo; Magwanga said.He added, &ldquo;I do not want to disappoint my supporters who came out in large numbers during the primaries. We won but we were short-changed.&rdquo;The Kasipul MP has promised a massive campaign, saying Awiti must be sent home.However, since he was issued with the ODM certificate, Awiti has never appeared at rallies or issued any statement concerning his victory.Some Homa Bay residents said they will vote for NASA&rsquo;s Raila, but for other candidates of their choice.They said they will not be dictated to or influenced by party affiliation.Homa Bay Bunge la Wenyenchi speaker Walter Opiyo, said they will vote for Raila &mdash; and choose &ldquo;performers&rdquo; for the remaining positions.
