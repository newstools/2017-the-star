Kitui Governor Julius Malombe officially broken ties with Deputy Governor Peninah Malonza on Monday, less than three months to the August 8 polls. The two have had a frosty working relationship since 2015.In her place, the governor picked unionist and Kyuso Knut branch executive secretary Agnes Kambua.Malombe unveiled Kambua, a graduate from the University of Nairobi, at the Kitui Kefri Centre. The ceremony was attended by the majority of incumbent MPs and MCAs and the candidates who were nominated by Wiper during the April 24 primaries.Unveiling Kambua as his new running mate, Malombe said she amply replaces Malonza, who was poached by his competitor for the Kitui governor seat Senator David Musila. Musila lost to Malombe in the Wiper nominations and later resigned from the party. He will vie as an independent candidate.
