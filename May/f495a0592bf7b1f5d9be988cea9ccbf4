National beach volleyball team coach Patrick Owino has unveiled a provisional team of eight players (men and women) to the African Cup of Nations qualifiers set for May 10-16 in Maputo, Mozambique. Ibrahim Odour, Jimmy Ngala, Donald Muchete and Nicolas Musyoka will fight for the two places in the men&rsquo;s squad while Kenya Pipeline duo of Gaudencia Makokha and Naomi Too and Nairobi Water&rsquo;s Nancy Mulonza and Praxidise Wekesa will be seeking to make the cut in the women&rsquo;s squad. The men&rsquo;s team pair of Odour and Ngala bagged gold in the recently concluded Zone Five seniors beach volleyball championship in Entebbe, Uganda, beating Rwanda and Ugand to second and third places respectively while Makokha and Jecinta Mueni settled for bronze, behind hosts Uganda and Rwanda in the women&rsquo;s category in the same event.Owino, who is also a stand-in coach for the Nairobi Water women&rsquo;s team that features in the Kenya Volleyball Federation national league, said eight players&mdash;four men and four women&mdash;will report to camp this Friday at a Mombasa hotel.Owino said they hope to extend their good performance in the men&rsquo;s category and improve on their women&rsquo;s show. &ldquo;Our target is to qualify for the Africa Cup of Nations in both the categories. We settled for bronze medal in the women&rsquo;s category because the pair had not played together for a while. We hope to improve on this,&rdquo; said Owino, adding: &ldquo;I intend to reshuffle the team as we want to send a strong side to the championship.&rdquo;At the same time, KBV chairman Ben Juma has lauded Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company for the support they continue to give beach volleyball and their contribution towards the just ended second leg of the KVF League at Ndakaini.He said: &ldquo;NSWC chairman Raphael Nzomo approved Sh800,000 to cater for the welfare of the beach volleyball team. NWSC staged a successful second leg and affirmed it will be an annual event on the KVF calendar. We are happy to associate with them going forward,&rdquo; said Juma. He added: &ldquo;Our budget for the beach team is Sh1.1 million and therefore the federation will have to cater for the remaining balance.&rdquo;
