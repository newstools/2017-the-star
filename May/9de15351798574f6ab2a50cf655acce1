The heckling and booing of NASA principal Kalonzo Musyoka &mdash; choice for Deputy President &mdash; at a funeral in Kitui last weekend was planned, Governor Julius Malombe has said.&ldquo;The chaotic incident was planned by goons and some of them are politicians. People were strategically positioned to shout when our party leaders spoke,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They shouted, demanding the Wiper nomination certificate which I had won fairly.&rdquo; The governor spoke after a meeting where the August 8 polls candidates met IEBC officials at Kitui Kefri Centre on Tuesday. &ldquo;I condemn the uncouth behaviour by individuals and leaders who played a role in the heinous incident. They should be very much ashamed of themselves,&rdquo; Malombe said. Kalonzo was heckled on Saturday during the funeral of the mother of Kitui Senator David Musila at AIC Migwani Primary School. Musila lost the Wiper nomination for Kitui governor to Malombe
