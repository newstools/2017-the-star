Turkana Deputy Governor Peter Ekai will be Senator John Munyes&rsquo; running mate on August 8, according to a list by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission.The deputy governor fell out with his boss, Governor Josephat Nanok, last year and he decamped from ODM to the Jubilee Party.Nanok (ODM) and Munyes will run for governor in what is expected to be a major political battle.The decision by Munyes to pick Nanok&rsquo;s deputy as his running mate is considered part of a wider political scheme to destabilise the governor&rsquo;s support base.Last week, Ekai said the county supports JP and expressed confidence that the party will be victorious in August.
