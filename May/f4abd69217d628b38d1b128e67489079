Pensioners got a negative net return on investment in 12 months through March 31 because of a rise in average cost of goods and services and erosion of share value on Nairobi Securities Exchange, industry data showed yesterday.Data by Alexander Forbes Financial Services, which conducts quarterly surveys on the industry, indicate that pension schemes made an average return of 7.8 per cent in the period against an average inflation of 10.3 per cent.The survey was conducted on 379 schemes which manage Sh582.5 billion in assets, the financial and risk management services firm said.This means that the median return on investment made by the private pension schemes has been below inflation in four of the last nine years, denoting a negative growth in net returns.The schemes posted a return of negative 6.6 per cent and negative 3.5 per cent on investments made in 2009 and 2012, respectively. Return in 2016 was 1.4 per cent, which was a negative net income when the average 6.5 per cent inflation was factored.&ldquo;The survey indicates that the median scheme did not always outperform overall inflation over the 1 year period,&rdquo; the Alexander Forbes said referring to performance in the last nine years.Pension schemes which invested the workers&rsquo; savings in fixed-income assets, largely government debt securities, however posted an average return of 14.7 per cent in year period to March 31, the report states.Offshore assets also generated 13.9 per cent for pension schemes in the review period.Equities nonetheless continued to dampen growth in returns for pensioners, posting a negative 11.6 per cent return. This was largely due to erosion of shares trading on the Nairobi Securities Exchange in the 12 months&rsquo; period.The survey, however, found that equity median return for the schemes surveyed outperformed the benchmark Nairobi Securities Exchange&rsquo;s 20-Share index, the All Share Index which monitors performance of all firms and FTSE NSE 25 which represents the performance of 25 most traded stocks.&ldquo;There was a significantly large range in equity returns over the one year period,&rdquo; Alexander Forbes said. &ldquo;This was attributable to an investment made by a scheme in an unquoted equity investment which generated a strong positive return.&rdquo;
