Gospel singer Size 8 and her celebrity hubby DJ Mo are rumoured to be navigating a rocky patch in their marriage.The relationship is at the brink of breaking after a source claimed Size 8 left her house with her daughter Ladasha Belle and moved into a house in Runda where they charge Sh90,000 per month in rent.We called Size 8 for a comment and she denied the claims, saying they were just rumours."I left my house in the morning. People will say anything. DJ Mo has never cheated on me and I do love him so much."Size 8 and her hubby have not been posting on their popular YouTube vlog, which also raised eyebrows, and when asked why, she replied; "I'm sick. I suffer from hypertension. I have been too sick, that's why we have taken a break, but we will continue soon once I'm stable."The Mateke hit singer went ahead to reveal why she doesn't wear her wedding ring, which could be the reason why some people may think it's over between her and DJ Mo."When I gave birth, I gained weight, hence my wedding ring couldn't fit me anymore. It's two years since I took it off and I've been training so hard to reduce my weight," she told Word Is.
