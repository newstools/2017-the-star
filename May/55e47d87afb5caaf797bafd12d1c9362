Veteran gospel artiste Daddy Owen has opened up about what he thought of Bahati and Willy Paul being snubbed for the second time in the Groove Awards nominations.&ldquo;Maybe this was their plan all along, not to be caught in Groove Awards, or they are changing what they are doing, or they feel that they are right and other people are wrong,&rdquo; he said."The difference is if you do true gospel music, you're always there, longevity, no one can beat you on that," he added, citing Mercy Masika.Owen concluded: "Let people judge you on your content and not sideshows because they are very expensive, and one day they will work against you and people will never believe you. You can't maintain or sustain your career with sideshows. That's the problem."
