County governments’ excessive spending on salaries and allowances continues to threaten devolution. Nairobi, Taita Taveta and Tharaka Nithi topped the list of counties with the highest spending on salaries and allowances. The latest Controller of Budget report covering the period between July 2016 and March 2017 shows the 47 counties splashed Sh91.39 billion on personnel emoluments. A total of Sh145 billion was spent on recurrent expenditure. The report tabled in the Senate on Tuesday states the expenditure on personnel emoluments by the counties exceeded the amount recorded in a similar 2015-16 financial year period by six per cent. Majority leader Kipchumba Murkomen tabled the report during the afternoon session chaired by Speaker Kenneth Lusaka. In the 9-month period under review, the counties’ costs on salaries and allowances stood at 61.8 per cent of total recurrent expenditure, up from Sh85.82 billion, translating to 46.7 per cent recorded in the previous period. “The office recommends personnel emoluments be maintained at sustainable levels and in line with Regulation 25 ( 1b) of the Public Finance Management (County Governments) Regulations, 2015,” Controller of Budget Agnes Odhiambo recommended. Nairobi splashed Sh9.61 billion on personnel emoluments of the Sh13.65 billion recurrent expenditure, Taita Taveta spent Sh1.56 billion of the Sh2.24 billion total, while Tharaka Nithi spent Sh1.19 billion of Sh1.56 billion total recurrent expenditure. “Analysis of personnel emoluments as a per centage by the county shows Nairobi city recorded the highest per cent at 63.6 per cent, Taita Taveta 61.2 per cent and Tharaka Nithi 61.1 per cent,” Odhiambo said. Mandera Governor Ali Roba, his Turkana counterpart Josphat Nanok and former Marsabit county boss Ukur Yatani’s administrations are counties with the least spending on staff.
