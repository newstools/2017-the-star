Five IEBC commissioners have rejected a memo allegedly written by chairman Wafula Chebukati to CEO Ezra Chiloba on the August 8 polls.In the memo seen by The Star, Chebukati detailed numerous failures by the secretariat that formed a key part of the Supreme Court proceedings."Respond and explain what happened to the printed forms that were meant to have various approved security features and names of candidates printed in accordance with the ballot proofs," he said in the document dated September 5.More on this: Chebukati demands answers from Chiloba as IEBC election fallout deepensBut the commissioners said in a statement to the media that they only came to know about the document through the media."A quick perusal of the memo shows that the allegations are based on some report or information that has not been brought to the attention of the commission," they said."Most of the issues are not factual and could easily mislead if taken out of context. The Secretariat is reviewing the issues and will prepare appropriate responses to be presented to the Commission Plenary," they added.The commissioners also assured the public that the electoral body is in the process of preparing for the October 17 repeat election."Our commitment is to ensure that a credible process is held in line with the principles enunciated by the Supreme Court in its brief judgment. We invite all Kenyans to stand by the Commission as it carries out this mandate," read the statement. The statement was issued initially by vice chair Consolata Nkatha and commissioners Yakub Guliye, Paul Kurgat, Boya Molu and Margaret Mwanchanya.However, about an hour later, Kurgat distanced himself from the statement."I was not consulted or briefed on the statement attributed to IEBC commissioners and sent to the news rooms this evening. I encourage my colleaques to m&agrave;k&egrave; use of our internal mechanisms and opportunities. I had fruitful discussions this evening with Bishop Alfred Rotich at Waumini house during which the statement was released." he said.Notably missing from the statement is commissioner Roselyne Akombe.
