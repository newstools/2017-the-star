Politicians in Kirinyaga skipped the launch of President Uhuru Kenyatta's election campaigns on Saturday. Murang'a Governor Mwangi wa Iria was leading a caravan to launch the event, but residents demanded to know why local leaders were not part of the team. "We have elected leaders here in Kirinyaga. Why are they not part of this team if you are genuine? We cannot see even a single MCA who is to introduce you people to us since you are strangers," an angry youth shouted at Kerugoya bus park. Residents who spoke to The Star said it was disrespectful for a team christened 'Jubilee Nation' to not involve local leaders, adding that there must be an ulterior motive. But Wa Iria asked residents to calm down as he was only seeking votes for Uhuru in the October repeat election. He asked residents to turn up in large numbers to ensure NASA's Raila Odinga does not win. Kerugoya MCA James Murango told The Star via text that they were not aware of the caravan. "I have talked to the Governor [Anne Waiguru] and all elected MPs and no one is aware of that caravan," he said. On Friday, politicians from Mt Kenya region met with Uhuru at the Sagana State Lodge to strategise on campaigns for the repeat presidential election.
