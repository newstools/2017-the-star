Two legislators from Homa Bay county have urged police to investigate frequent fires at Wang’apala High School in Kabondo Kasipul constituency. County woman representative Gladys Wanga and MP Eve Obara said the recurrent blazes are worrying. They said last Friday’s dormitory fire was the third in one year. In that fire, 383 students were affected. No one was hurt. Wanga said police should investigate the root cause as arson is frightening students, teachers and parents. “If not stopped, it will affect the students’ performance,” she said. Wanga spoke when the two lawmakers donated bedding to affected students on Tuesday. Obara said culprits should be punished in court. “It’s unfortunate that 1,000 students have been sent home indefinitely due to the fire. This interrupts their study timetable,” she said. The legislators urged well-wishers to assist the students. They donated 340 mattresses, 340 blankets and 340 sets of bed sheets.
