A lecturer has been summoned to record a statement after allegedly giving a KCSE candidate a pistol. The 17-year-old Orero High School student was found with the pistol in school last Wednesday. He had hidden the weapon in a shallow hole covered with dry grass. "A student leaked information to one of the teachers that the student owned a gun," principal Dickens Bula told journalists during the arrest.

"We've summoned the lecturer to come and record a statement on the issue," he said on Sunday. Tum said they are likely to charge the lecturer with negligence or improper use of a firearm. He said investigations revealed that the boy broke into a box where the gun was kept and left with it for school. "The boy's mother told police that the box was broken into before the gun was taken," Tum said. "She told us that she didn't know why the boy took the gun because he had never had a criminal record," he said. Police said the HK 45 pistol was in good condition and could soot, but it had no ammunition. The student denied charges when he appeared before Homa Bay Senior Resident Magistrate Ruth Maloba on Friday. His lawyer Albert Ongoso asked the court to release him on bond since he will be sitting KCSE exams. State counsel Dennis Shabola told the court to use a clinical health card and birth certificate to determine the student's age so that he could be prosecuted. The student was released on a bond of Sh30,000 and a cash bail of Sh10,000. The case will be mentioned on September 28 ahead of hearing on December 4.
