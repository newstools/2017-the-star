Nyamira Governor John Nyagarama has urged MCAs to unite and work harmoniously with the executive to achieve development. The reelected governor urged the new MCAs to learn from the reelected members, bearing in mind that most were kicked out on August 8. Nyagarama spoke during the official assembly opening on Tuesday. The event was attended by 35 MCAs. He urged county leaders to focus on development to make Nyamira a model county. Nyagarama said his government will consult with the assembly to achieve the pledges they made to residents. The governor said corruption is a major problem that hinders development. He warned county officials against engaging in graft. “We will fight to make sure corruption is no more in the county,” Nyagarama promised. He has also urged the MCAs to work as a team and avoid wrangles that can inhibit services. “I urge all of us to move together in ensuring our county makes bold strides in development. This will be achieved as we hold each others’ hands on arising matters,” Nyagarama said. He also listed his administration’s achievements. They  include improved  infrastructure, upgrading of health facilities, agriculture and security. Nyagarama said his government will do much in his second term. Early this month, newly elected assembly speaker Moffat Teya urged MCAs to work in harmony and prioritise development. He urged the MCAs to offer quality services to residents, irrespective of their political affiliation. “I invite all MCAs and the people of Nyamira to join me in ensuring we take the county to the next level. Whether elected or nominated, our goal is to deliver,” Teya said. He said residents expect nothing, but services from the leaders whom they have put in power. Teya said this can only be achieved if the county members work in harmony.
