Nyamira leaders want President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto to apologise for attacking the Judiciary after Friday&rsquo;s Supreme Court ruling.Led by Nyamira Governor John Nyagarama, Senator Okong&rsquo;o Omogeni, MP Borabu Ben Momanyi and West Mugirango MP Vincent Kemosi, they criticised the attacks by the two, saying it was uncalled for and regrettable.In a press conference in Kisumu yesterday, they condemned the onslaught against CJ David Maraga and his team of Supreme Court judges, terming it a breach of the rule of law.They took issue with Uhuru, saying he is the one who advised Nasa to seek recourse in court in the event they were dissatisfied with the elections outcome.The leaders said he should be the last person to cast aspersions on the Supreme Court. &ldquo;We wish to remind him that Supreme Court is independent and the third arm of the government. Uhuru must respect the constitutional principles of separation of powers, &ldquo; Omogeni said. He said the same way they accepted the verdict in 2013 after ruling of the presidential petition is the same way they should accept it now.
