Fast and reliable data will therefore be a key consideration when this demographic makes their next smartphone purchase. Samsung is therefore gearing itself to provide quality and affordable 4G-enabled devices. If you look at the J7 Neo, it comes with 4G support. Consumer experience is also a key consideration especially when browsing on the internet.&acirc;&#128;&#157;With its 5.5&acirc;&#128;&#157; display and crisp HD resolution (1,280 x 720 HD), the Galaxy J7 Neo brings out every last detail and offers an incredible viewing experience.
