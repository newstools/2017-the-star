Former Meru Governor Peter Munya has been reinstated as PNU leader days after he ended his dalliance with NASA. Munya made an about-turn on his allegiance to NASA and will now work with President Uhuru Kenyatta's Jubilee Party. This followed a meeting at State House on Tuesday.

The earlier notice had ended Munya’s controversial stint at the helm of the PNU alongside other officials elected last year. In a judgment on June 22, the tribunal ruled in favour of petitioner Alphonce Mbida that the party officials were not properly elected and were in office illegally. It ordered its officials to vacate office within seven days. The tribunal also ruled that Munya's team, which took office on October 28, 2016, hand over office to the previous officials until a proper delegates meeting is held.
