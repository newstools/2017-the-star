You are aware that we have spelled out to the
IEBC our position, namely the irreducible minimums package of actions that will
ensure that the fresh election complies with the Supreme Court’s order that it
must be in strict conformity with the Constitution and the law. You will also be aware that the IEBC had
invited the parties to the election to a meeting on Wednesday, but the meeting
was deferred, because the Supreme Court chose to read the judgment on that
day. We regret to inform the public today that the
IEBC continues to proceed on a business as usual manner that it has adopted
since the annulment of the presidential election. We have received a letter from the Chairman
of the IEBC as a follow-up to a technical meeting between NASA, Jubilee and the
commission in which it has communicated its unilateral decisions on all the
critical aspects of the election, thus making any further engagement
superfluous. Of note, the Chairman’s letter avoids
entirely the issue of accountability for the illegalities and irregularities
that precipitated invalidation of the August 8 election. This is despite the
fact that several of its senior officers are now formally under
investigation. Moreover, the Chairman’s letter contains yet
more admissions by the IEBC of culpability by stating that “the system
functionalities have been reconfigured to ensure that there is no text result
transmitted without the scanned image”, which amounts to admitting that this
functionality was subsequently tampered with. This is yet more evidence the KIEMs provider
Safran Morpho as well as the telecommunications service providers are IEBC’s
partners in crime, who must also be held to account. First, the fresh election must conform to the
Constitution and the law, as ordered by the Supreme Court. Second, there must be full accountability for
the August 8 election.  In this regard, we demand that all the IEBC
officers now under investigation must step aside. Third, we shall not accept the participation
of existing suppliers unless and until they are cleared of acts of commission
or omission in the illegalities and irregularities of the August 8 election. We have in our possession very credible
evidence that points to culpability of Safaricom Ltd on the basis of which we
are proceeding to institute a private prosecution against the company and its
directors. The writer is the Bungoma Senator
