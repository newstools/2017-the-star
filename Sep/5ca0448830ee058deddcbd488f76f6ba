An Indian firm plans to invest in infrastructure in Busia and use it as a model for development to be replicated in other counties. Choice Peers International Limited vice president Pallav Patodia (pictured) said the firm will focus on solid and water waste management, irrigation, water conservation, energy, roads and overall infrastructure in the county. He spoke in Busia after a meeting with Water and Irrigation executive Bernard Yaite. “Kenya is our primary and immediate focus, although we are also exploring  opportunities. We shall do the same in Uganda and Tanzania,” Patodia said. Yaite said the county is seeking ways to partner with Choice Peers to upgrade water infrastructure, harness energy, manage solid waste and conserve the environment.
