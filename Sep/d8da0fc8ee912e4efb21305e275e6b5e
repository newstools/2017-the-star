Fire broke out twice at  the Migori county government procurement office on Sunday night. A store was completely destroyed when fire was first reported at 10pm. A fire engine from Sony Sugar Company put out the fire. Migori OCPD Gladys Rutere said fire broke out again about 2am. A fire engine was called again when a second fire broke out. The cause of the fire is unknown, Rutere said. Migori criminal investigations officer Benedict Kigen said fire experts are probing the incident. “We have summoned procurement officials to record statements,” Kigen said. Migori Governor Okoth Obado’s director of communications Nicholas Anyuor said the facility that was burnt was a store, and not the procurement office.
