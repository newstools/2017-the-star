The Kajiado assembly has rejected two executive nominees. They are Caroline Chege (Public Service) and Joseph Sankale (Water and Irrigation). The two are among 10 nominated by Governor Joseph Lenku to take up county ministerial positions. The MCAs rejected the two, saying Lenku should consider experience and performance when nominating executives instead of making political rewards. In the motion moved by majority party leader Julius Moipaai on Tuesday and unanimously approved by the House, the MCAs said Chege failed to provide requisite documents and to comply with the notice placed in the newspapers requiring nominees to hand in questionnaires and other documents on time. “The committee nevertheless indulged the nominee and accepted to undertake the approval hearing after she requested to be given more time to produce the documents. Given the second chance, the nominee was not within the precincts of the assembly,” he said. Moipaai said the committee was left with no option but to reject her nomination. In Sankale’s case, the MCAs said he demonstrated “complete lack of knowledge in the docket he was nominated for”. “His inability to correctly answer even the simplest of questions posted to him by the panel was astonishing. His freestyle and reckless way in answering the questions clearly showed his lack of competence in his nominated docket,” Moipai said. He said the committee noted the candidate was not qualified, especially in policymaking. Moipai said the man exposed his lack of understanding of the structure of the county government, including the basics of the functions and the relationship between the executive and chief officer.
