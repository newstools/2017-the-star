Did India's economic reforms lead to a sharp rise in inequality? New research by French economists Lucas Chancel and Thomas Piketty, author of Capital, the 2013 bestselling book on capitalism and increasing inequality, clearly points to this conclusion. They studied household consumption surveys, federal accounts and income tax data from 1922 - when the tax was introduced in India - to 2014. The data shows that the share of national income accruing to the top 1 per cent of wage earners is now at its highest level since Indians began paying income tax. The economists say the top 1 per cent of the earners captured less than 21 per cent of the total income in the late 1930s, before dropping to 6% in the early 1980s and rising to 22% today. India, in fact, comes out as a country with one of the highest increase in top 1 per cent income share concentration over the past 30 years," they say. To be sure, India's economy has undergone a radical transformation over the last three decades. Up to the 1970s, India was a tightly regulated, straitlaced economy with socialist planning. Growth crawled (3.5% per year), development was weak and poverty endemic. Some easing of regulation, decline in tax rates and modest reforms led to growth picking up in the 1980s, trundling at around 5% a year. This was followed by some substantial reforms in the early 1990s after which the economy grew briskly, nudging close to double digits in the mid-2000s.
