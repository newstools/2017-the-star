SportPesa Premier League leaders Gor Mahia have paid the ultimate price of a High Court ruling which demanded a 16-team league forcing the league body to suspend Nakumatt and Kericho Zoo. Following the decision, Gor Mahia have been deducted nine points they had won against the two sides.This has seen the former champions advantage at the top whittled from 12 points to just five, ahead of Kakamega Homeboyz who have 40 points. However, the 15-time champions have two matches in hand which they will capitalise on if they are to keep their cushion at the summit safe enough. Other losers of the ruling are Sofapaka who had collected three points against Zoo FC and three against Nakumatt earlier in the season. Dropping six points also saw them drop two places from second on the log, with 36 points. The move saw Sofapaka exchange places with Ulinzi Stars, who moved from fourth to third, losing just three points in the shake up to settle at 37 points. Kariobangi Sharks remained fifth on the log with 35 points, losing four points from their initial tally while Posta Rangers also stay sixth with 35 points after dropping a similar number of points Defending champions Tusker also faced the same fate as they surrendered six points to sit seventh on the log with 33 points. AFC Leopards are also big losers in the new order. The KPL giants remain 12th on the log with 31 points after relinquishing seven points from their initial tally on 24. However, all was not gloom for some of the teams who had little to show for in contest against the unfortunate duo. Western Stima moved from 17th place in the 18 team schedule to 13th place in the 16â€“team roster while retaining their 22 points garnered.
