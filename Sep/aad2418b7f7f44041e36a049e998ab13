Any points that Mathare United get on board at this time of the campaign will be more than welcome. Yesterday, the Slum Boys continued to huff and puff their way out of the relegation zone as they held AFC Leopards to a goalless draw to inch  four points clear of the bottom two. Francis Kimanzi had said that, as a coach, he had never been in a situation where his team was fighting relegation,  hinting further at lack of a good budget that can purchase and sustain quality players, to help them challenge for the title. Kimanzi, a title winner with the same club a decade ago, said hey had changed their goals as they had depended on young players. That inexperience has been there for all to see as Mathare has lurched from one poor result to another. Yesterday, one of the youngsters, Cliff Nyakenya should have put them ahead early in the match but fluffed his lines in a match that was devoid of many goal-scoring opportunities. For Leopards, the point was more than welcome as they leaped two places to position 11 with 32 points from 26 matches. Mathare, meanwhile, are on 26 points. They are currently just two above third from bottom Thika United who also got a precious point on their visit to face soldiers Ulinzi Stars in Nakuru yesterday. The result left Nicholas Muyoti’s men still very much in danger of relegation as hey are just two points clear of Western Stima and three better than Muhoroni Youth. Both Stima and the basement side have two games in hand that will go a long way in defining the way the intriguing fight to beat the drop will eventually pan out. For Ulinzi, the two points dropped all but ended their hopes of a barnstorming finish to the campaign as they are now  well out of the title picture. The soldiers have 42 points from 26 matches.
