The office of the Director of Public Prosecutions has a constitutional and a statutory responsibility to prosecute where there is establishment of impropriety or where there is a violation of the law.The constitutional and statutory laws have given the office of the DPP such immense responsibility and therefore it is my belief and that of the entire legal fraternity that the DPP will discharge his responsibility.I want to note that and this has nothing to do with the judgment of the Supreme Court, but when it comes to expectations, the DPP has previously failed to prosecute public officers who have violated the law that prohibits them from showing anything but neutrality.There was a letter that was written to the DPP by the Office of the Ombudsman listing public officials who should be prosecuted, but nothing has happened to the list so far. So it is a demonstration of the commitment to the Constitution and statutory obligations that have been bestowed in that office. So even as we await the full judgment so that we can see who is culpable for the mess that was witnessed in the nullified Presidential election within the Independent and Electoral and Boundaries Commission, the officials in the Ombudsman&acirc;&#128;&#153;s list should face the law. There was also a letter that was written by the Law Society of Kenya to the Public Service Commission and copied to the office of the DPP. This was a complaint in regard to participation in political party fundraising by the Kenya Revenue Authority Director General and some Cabinet Secretaries .To date, no action has been taken against the named public officials. Therefore these institutions &acirc;&#128;&#147; the ODPP and the PSC &acirc;&#128;&#147; must discharge their constitutional and statutory obligations without failure as expected by the members of the public.The PSC has a responsibility to discipline public servants who violate the laws on leadership and integrity. We expected them to take action &acirc;&#128;&#147; but they have done nothing.Therefore, on this matter of the IEBC, when the full judgment is made public and has named people within the commission who will have been found to be culpable for irregularities and illegalities, the ODPP must taken action immediately.There is no way the public will have confidence and faith in the commission, if those elements responsible will remain without facing the consequences thereafter.
