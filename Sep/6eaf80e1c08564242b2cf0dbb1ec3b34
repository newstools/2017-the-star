A delegation of Caf officials led by second deputy President Constant Omari will be in the country from today to continue their appraisal of Kenya&rsquo;s ability to host the African Nations Championship (CHAN) awarded to the country in 2015.Omari accompanied by six other Caf officials, they will be received by their hosts before reverting to the serious matter of determining the country&rsquo;s readiness to host the tournament that features national team players, who ply their trade in their local leagues.Speculation has been rife that the country might not be ready to host the 16-team tourney with naysayers pointing out that only Kasarani and Nyayo Stadium were of the standards set by Caf&mdash;fears that have been rebuffed very strongly by Football Kenya Federation and Ministry of Sports officials led by the Principal Secretary. Both have maintained that the country with the support of the government will host the tournament. That is exactly why the Caf officials will be in the country to prove, starting with guided tours of stadiums in Nairobi today followed by a visit to Meru&rsquo;s Kinoru Stadium tomorro. They will also visit Kenyatta Stadium in Machakos which has already hosted Caf international matches played by the Harambee Starlets.The seven-man team will conclude their appraisal duties by travelling to Eldoret to have a look at the Eldoret Stadium before returning to the city on Friday to field questions arising from his tour. Pundits aver that this latest tour by Omari will make or break the country&rsquo;s desire to host this competition.With the Caf top brass reportedly set to meet next week, the report from this delegation will be among the things on the table with January fast approaching. It has been suggested that Morocco are on standby to play host should the country suffer the ignominy of being unable to host a tournament that they themselves sought. That will definite bring with it sanctions from the continental body. It is not lost on football lovers that two decades ago another opportunity for Kenya to host the African Nations Cup slipped through their fingers.
