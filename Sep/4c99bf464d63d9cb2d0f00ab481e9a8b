Water CS Eugene Wamalwa has warned NASA against spreading fear of a constitutional crisis if a repeat presidential election is not held in 60 days as ordered by the Supreme Court. He urged voters to keep away from “false prophets” who instil fear that Uhuru Kenyatta will cease to be President if a fresh election is not conducted by November 1. “We are ready for reelection as Jubilee, but our rivals are manipulating voters by misinterpreting the Constitution,” Wamalwa said. The CS said Section 142 of the Constitution allows Uhuru to remain President. It says a President will hold office from when he is sworn in until, “the person next elected President in accordance with Article 136 (2) (a) is sworn in.”
