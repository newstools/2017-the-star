Jimmy Gait is stepping up his entrepreneurial game. Today, he will be launching a product that will be sold to the mass market. The gospel star, who has been subject to online cyber bulling via memes and tweets, has taken the opportunity to brand a product that will fetch him a pretty dollar. The Cool Your Temper singer will be the face of his success card product line. "They will be personalised and will encourage candidates that whatever they face, they can conquer," Jimmy Gait told Word Is. "I want it to work for me and for the industry at large." The launch will be at the After 40 Hotel.
