A defiant Chief Justice David Maraga yesterday told the President and Parliament the Judiciary will not bend to their will and said he was ready to "pay the ultimate price" to protect the Constitution.He said the Judiciary has been assailed, threatened and reviled by politicians and on social media.Maraga spoke even as hundreds of jubilee supporters took to the streets to demand his removal.Petitions have been filed to remove three Supreme Court judges. MP Ngunjiri Wambugu's petition to remove the CJ was withdrawn. Another petition filed on Monday by Derrick Malika Ngumu seeks the removal of DCJ Philomena Mwilu and Justice Isaac Lenaola. All three cite gross misconduct.Ngumu, executive director at Angaza Empowerment Network NGO, yesterday filed another case at the Supreme Court, asking it to vacate its nullification on September 1 of President Uhuru Kenyatta's victory.Maraga said the Judiciary as an arm of government will not allow the Executive or the Legislature to dictate how courts will discharge their duties. He told those attacking the Judiciary to call a referendum to amend the Constitution if they wish to scrap the apex court.&acirc;&#128;&#156;If the leaders are tired of having a strong and independent Judiciary, they should call a referendum and abolish it altogether,&acirc;&#128;&#157; he said after chairing a JSC meeting. Member Attorney General Githu Muigai did not attend.While pointing a finger at politicians, Maraga said individual judges, particularly of the Supreme Court, and other judicial officers and staff, have been attacked, threatened and negatively profiled on social media.&acirc;&#128;&#156;They have also threatened the Judiciary, promising &acirc;&#128;&#152;to cut it down to size&acirc;&#128;&#153; and &acirc;&#128;&#152;teach us a lesson'. These attacks are denigrating, demeaning and degrading and are meant to intimidate, threaten and cow the institution and individual judges, but we are prepared to pay the ultimate price to protect the rule of law,&acirc;&#128;&#157; Maraga said.Jubilee demonstrators shouted outside the Supreme Court building and called for Maraga's removal for &acirc;&#128;&#156;stealing their victory&acirc;&#128;&#157;, referring to Kenyatta's win.Jubilee supporters also held demonstrations that appeared choreographed and well coordinated in Nairobi, Nakuru, Kikuyu, Nyeri, Karatina, Limuru and Eldoret towns. Business was paralysed for hours.Protesters waving twigs and placards outside the Supreme Court building accused the judges of illegally annulling Kenyatta&acirc;&#128;&#153;s victory. They said a recount should have been ordered.Today the court will issue a detailed and complete judgment on the election petition filed by NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga.Led by Governor Lee Kinyanjui and Nakuru town East MP David Gikaria, protesters in Nakuru barricaded the Nakuru-Nairobi highway, blocking transport.They said they will continue protests until Kenyatta is sworn in for a second term.They singled out DCJ Mwilu and Justice Lenaola, whom they said favoured the opposition in the petition. The ruling was 4-2.Senators James Orengo and Amos Wako have denied claims by petitioner Derrick Ngumu they met some judges while the petition was being heard. They called the reports "figments of fertile imagination".Maraga said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;These attacks have become even more aggressive, culminating in lengthy uninterrupted demonstrations right outside the Supreme Court Building yesterday and today.&acirc;&#128;&#157;&acirc;&#128;&#156;We therefore will never agree to work in accordance with the whims and desires of the Executive and Parliament. The Judiciary as currently constituted cannot and shall not guarantee a particular outcome to any individual," he said.The CJ also accused Police IG Joseph Boinett of failing to take action against the threats against judges.Boinett is expected to provide security to all government facilities yet he has repeatedly ignored calls to act, further exposing judicial officers, property and litigants to danger, Maraga said.But the IG through spokesman George Kinoti denied the claims, saying all judges have police bodyguards attached to them and their homes."We also provide security to all courthouses, and as the situation demands in some circumstances we enhance security with the view to ensuring courthouses and judicial officers are secure."The truth is born out of facts, and they are plain for any citizen to check and confirm," the IG said.Maraga said the Judiciary will continue to act independently and discharge its mandate in accordance with the Constitution and individual oaths of office.The Chief Justice termed unfortunate the Monday incident in Kirinyaga county where Martha Karua was blocked by demonstrators from accessing the courts for the hearing of her petition against against the election of Governor Ann Waiguru.Maraga said it was worrying, especially as the Judiciary is about to start hearing the 339 election petitions filed countrywide.Senate Majority Leader Kipchumba Murkomen said it was wrong for the CJ to respond to media reports."It is worse when the CJ speaks like a biased politician who is ready to pay 'the ultimate price'. When a CJ speaks with such anger, then how will Kenyans expect justice? When the political madness created by the Supreme Court will pass away, the press statement issued by the Chief Justice will be studied and analysed again," Murkomen said.Nyeri town MP Ngunjiri Wambugu &acirc;&#128;&#148; who filed the petition for his removal &acirc;&#128;&#148; accused the CJ of intimidating Kenyans who were exercising their constitutional rights to demonstrate and file petitions.He was told to withdraw the petition by President Kenyatta who himself had called the justices wakora, had pronounced the Judiciary broken and declaredhe would fix it when he was reelected.
