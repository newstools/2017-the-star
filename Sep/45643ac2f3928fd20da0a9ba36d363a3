John Njue, the fourth Kenyan Cardinal of the Catholic Church, has urged President Uhuru Kenyatta and NASA leader Raila Odinga to stop being confrontational ahead of the repeat presidential election on October 26. Speaking at Mbituri Catholic Church’s 31st anniversary in Embu East on Sunday, Njue warned the two are raising tensions and anxiety countrywide. The Cardinal is quite right. The retaliatory campaign rhetoric is getting out of hand, right down to Babu Owino’s toxic “son of a dog” uttered at the weekend in Raila’s presence. The President and the former Prime Minister should set the tone and it should be a role-model example. Raila is lately too abusive and accusatory. The President has called the Supreme Court judges “wakora”. The two need to meet and decide to take control of their own rhetoric dogs. As statesmen, they should tone down the rhetoric as neither side is relenting and they are inflaming public passions dangerously. Cardinal Njue warned the campaign is threatening to tear the country apart.
