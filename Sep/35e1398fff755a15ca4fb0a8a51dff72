President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday accused NASA chief Raila Odinga of stagnating the economy and promised to deal with the opposition demonstrators ruthlessly if they break the law. He said the continued attacks on his administration by Raila have hurt the economy. “Hii maneno yake ndiyo inafanya uchumi usiendelee (His statements stagnate the growth of the economy),” Uhuru said. He spoke during Jubilee campaigns in Embu and Tharaka Nithi counties. Uhuru said the opposition is free to hold peaceful demonstrations. NASA plans to start protests today to force IEBC chief executive Ezra Chiloba to step down. Uhuru warned that any violence or destruction of property will be met with the full force of the law. The President is back on a vote-hunting mission in his strongholds ahead of the repeat presidential election on October 26. Tharaka Nithi and Embu counties are part of his Mt Kenya strongholds. The President was accompanied by DP William Ruto, Tharaka Nithi Governor Muthomi Njuki, Senator Kindiki Kithure and several MPs from the area. Embu leaders included Governor Martin Wambora and former Senator Lenny Kivuti. Uhuru told the opposition leader to pull out of the fresh election if he is not ready. “They [opposition] have to decide whether they want to be the adjudicators or the candidates, because they cannot be both,” Uhuru said. Ruto told the opposition to leave the IEBC alone to conduct the repeat polls as directed by the Supreme Court. “They want to precipitate a constitutional crisis so they can ascend to power through the backdoor, but we are telling them that will not happen,” the Deputy President said. Ruto said the opposition is not ready for the October 26 repeat polls, because they know they do not have the numbers to win the election.
