Traders of the Garissa market, also known as Suq Mukti, now want the government to provide 24-hour security at the facility. Addressing the press at the market, the traders expressed fears of an arson attack on the market. Unknown people set the 1,450 trader capacity market ablaze last month. Fatuma Hussein, a juice vendor, said they have information about the impending attack. “We have information that some powerful individuals are planning to use goons again to burn the market. They are keen on scaring us away so that they get the opportunity to grab this land,” said Fatuma. She said they will use all means possible to defend their only source of livelihood. “We have nowhere else to go. We are ready to defend this market at all cost, because it is where we get our daily bread,” she added. Abdi Nasir, a tailor, urged the government to halt the planned construction of a modern market and instead focus on providing security. The traders are currently forced to carry their wares to and from the market for fear of the attack. Last month’s fire destroyed property worth Sh96 million.
