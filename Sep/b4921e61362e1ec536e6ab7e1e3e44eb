City Hall now wants a law passed to give the Kenya Revenue Authority powers to attach vehicles for motorists who evade paying parking fees.Parking services director Fredrick Ndunyu said this would help reign in errant motorists who are play cat-and-mouse games with parking officers and deny the county revenue.According to Jambo Pay chief executive Danson Muchemi at least Sh2,000 motorists in the city do not pay parking fees each day via EJijiPay.EJijiPay platform &mdash; the online parking payment system run by JamboPay, records details of all vehicles parked in the city each day and shows whether or not their owners paid the fees.He said this denies the county at least Sh600,000 each day, translating into about Sh18 million per month.Ndunyu wants the assembly to pass a law that would enable them relay information on these defaulters to NTSA and KRA. KRA should then enforce payments or attach such vehicles. That is the only way to enure compliance.He also wants motorists who skipped paying parking fees the previous day to be compelled to do so.&ldquo;We clamp many vehicles whose owners do not pay for parking. But at 6pm, we unclamp them because we lakc specialised breakdownsto tow the vehicles,&rdquo; he said.Muchemi attributed the high defaulting rate to laxity by the parking attendants. They don't ensure defaulting motorists' cars are clamped and towed away.Collusion between some corrupt county parking attendants and motorists is also blamed for the revenue leakages.&ldquo;I cannot defend my officers 100 percent but no case has been reported to me. We have our team of detectives monitoring these officers,&rdquo; Ndunyu said.Jambo Pay has sought permission to import two drones to monitor vehicles whose owners do not pay parking fees.The company has written to the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority, seeking permission to import the cameras to help enforce revenue collection.&ldquo;We have developed an aerial imagery compliance data-gathering module that will require us to deploy a drone to collect parking compliance data,&rdquo; Muchemi said in a letter to KCCA director general Gilbert Kibe.
