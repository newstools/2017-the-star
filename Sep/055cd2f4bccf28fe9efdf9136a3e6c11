The governmentâ€™s removal of Raila Odingaâ€™s security detail, whether partial or a scaling down, is wrong. We have only two Presidential candidates for the historic repeat race for State House on October 26. NASA tells the media the withdrawal was complete but the National Police Service says it was merely reduced. Given the escalating tensions of the campaign, it was the wrong thing to adjust a Presidential candidateâ€™s security downwards just now, given the mutual ratcheting up of tensions and animosities. Incumbent President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto are well-guarded by the elite Recce Company of the paramilitary General Service Unit. Former Prime Minister Raila and his running mate, former Vice President Kalonzo Musyoka, deserve the most complete security possible in the run-up to the rerun. The timing of the readjustment of their security arrangements could not have come at a worse juncture, regardless of whether 5,000 police officers have recently retired. NASA wants the playing field levelled. Jubilee should revoke this security decision.
