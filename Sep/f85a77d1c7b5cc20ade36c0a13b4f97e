Michael Soi is a painter with a long and illustrious career in Nairobi. Renowned for his commentary on socio-political concerning Kenyans, he has a reputation for showing up hypocrisy and corruption and other topics that people would prefer to hide from society. This exhibition shows, for the first time, photographs of the artist working directly with the human body. Soi has displayed extensively locally and internationally, most recently in Japan, and is currently working on his first solo show in West Africa in Accra in early next year.  The exhibition opened on August 30 and runs until tomorrow at the Circle Art Gallery.
