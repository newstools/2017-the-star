Kisumu residents have taken to the streets in solidarity with their NASA counterparts in Nairobi who want to force IEBC officials out of office through protests. Among those NASA chief Raila Odinga wants out, for allegedly bungling the August presidential election, is Chief Executive Officer Ezra Chiloba. The Nairobi demonstrations are expected to take place outside the electoral agency's Anniversary Towers' offices, despite chairman Wafula Chebukati's plea against it. In Kisumu, the protesters marched peacefully waving placards reading 'Chiloba must go'. Some were on foot and others on motorcycles. They shouted that reforms must take place at the IEBC. In the city, tens of anti-riot police have been mobilised and instructed to disperse demonstrators should the protests turn violent. They are waiting at various police stations and a spot check by The Star some having tea.

It did not identify specific people. But NASA claims Chiloba and others botched and rigged the August 8 general election and cannot be trusted to handle a rerun. Chiloba is at the centre of the protracted standoff and the NASA coalition has called for his sacking. The Opposition has pledged to boycott the rerun if it's supervised by Chiloba and 'indicted' secretariat staff. Raila and other Opposition leaders have insisted there will be no election on October 26 with the officials in office. But Chiloba has said he will not resign as he is busy with the repeat poll. "I have no comment," he said when asked if he would yield to mounting pressure to resign. More on this: Chiloba: I’m busy with rerun, no plan to quit
