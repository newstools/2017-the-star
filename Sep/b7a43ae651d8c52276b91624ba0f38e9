Governor Hassan Joho is expected to address the Mombasa county assembly this afternoon, with the new assembly promising to prove its critics wrong. Critics of the previous assembly labelled it a rubberstamp for Joho, despite having 11 rebel MCAs, who would hear none of the county boss’s demands. The rebels, led by former Kongowea MCA Jabess Oduor, were kicked out on August 8. The House has 42 MCAs. ODM has 27. Wiper and Ford Kenya have one each. One is an independent. ODM nominated 12. The MCAs have promised to deliver on their mandate in line with residents’ expectations. They want to shed that rubber stamp tag. Tudor’s Tobias Samba said they will listen keenly to Joho’s address before thorough debate.
