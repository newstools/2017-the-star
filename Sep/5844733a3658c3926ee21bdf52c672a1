Kenyan tennis players posted mixed results in the Africa under 14 tennis championships in Cairo, Egypt yesterday. Angella Okutoyi beat Cherif Ines of Algeria 7-6 (2) 6-2 while Nicole Agufana lost to Shaban Ziena Amr of Egypt 6-1, 6-1. Cynthia Cheruto was no match for Charl Maria losing 6-0, 6-1 as Alicia Owegi lost to Morocco’s Rakim Sara of Morocco 6-1, 6-2. Okutoyi and Ines were competitive in the opening 10 games of the first set with play going to serve and the score tied at 5-5. Okutoyi then clinched the 11th game but lost momentum in the next to see the Algerian tie the match and go to a tie break at 6-6. Okutoyi steadied her nerves in the tie breaker to win two consecutive games. Ines came out firing in the second set breaking Okutoyi’s serve to lead 2-0 but a resolute Okutoyi came from behind to win the third and fourth game to tie the match at 2-2 and from then on dictated the game with stellar service to put the game out of reach for the Algerian to advance to the next round. Agufana looked out of sorts in the match as the Egyptian toyed with her to cruise to the second round.
