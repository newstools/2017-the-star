Disorganised operations, dangerous driving and uncouth behaviour by PSV crews have made residents choose taxis and private cars.City planner Lawrence Esho on Monday told the Star the behaviour of matatu crews is &acirc;&#128;&#156;irredeemable&acirc;&#128;&#157; and this is the main reason many residents use private cars.&acirc;&#128;&#156;Their behaviour and manners on the road are extremely bad. This makes residents see them negatively,&acirc;&#128;&#157; he said.Esho said he is convinced disciplining the matatu operators is impossible. He said noise and the way matatus are driven in total disregard of the Highway Code also keep passengers away.&acirc;&#128;&#156;If you want a good policy on public transport, you prevent private cars from coming to town, not public ones,&acirc;&#128;&#157; Esho said.Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has ordered PSVs banned from the city centre from today. But protests by matatu owners has since forced him to give the operators one more month.After that they will no longer be allowed into the CBD.Esho said Sonko needs to consult all players in the transport industry before enforcing the rule.He said Sonko&acirc;&#128;&#153;s proposal is good, but there should be a system to carry passengers in and out of town to avoid inconvenience.&acirc;&#128;&#156;Lanes can be reserved for public transport, where passengers are dropped and picked. It requires discipline by matatu operators,&acirc;&#128;&#157; Esho said.Traffic will move faster and private cars users will start using PSVs, he said.The city planner said the road network in the city is not the problem because roads are wide enough.&acirc;&#128;&#156;The way people drive on roads is pathetic. Drivers don&acirc;&#128;&#153;t keep to their lanes, leading to many accidents.&acirc;&#128;&#157;Citing Uber taxis, Esho said for the public transport system to flow, there should be no parking in the city.&acirc;&#128;&#156;What we have are pick up and drop off points. A matatu should drop off passengers and drive out and keep moving. Five minutes is the maximum time for dropping and picking passengers,&acirc;&#128;&#157; Esho said.Esho said former Transport minister John Michuki tried to bring order to the sector, but all his efforts have since been watered down.
