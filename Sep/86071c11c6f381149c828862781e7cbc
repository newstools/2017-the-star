This is a historic and momentous judgment that establishes and affirms the supremacy of our Constitution.It also affirms beyond any doubt the independence of our Judiciary.It is sending a message now that when it comes to the election process in Kenya, they must go strictly with the conditions of the Constitution and they must be run in strict conformity with the election laws.There is no excuse. Every election that we have had in Kenya, save for 2002, there have been complaints, irregularities, suspicion of impropriety and we have never before today been able to surmount this challenge because the Judiciary had never been able to take up the challenge to puts its foot down and stamp upon the process its authority of the supreme law.Today I am supremely proud of the Law Society of Kenya, because of successful joint proceedings as amicus curiae to articulate one position: In this electoral process, strict adherence to the Constitution is paramount and we have been vindicated in the results of the court. It is a great day for Kenya. This judgment sets an example for Africa.The rest of Africa is now watching Kenya and the judgment will surely be read, discussed in academic forums across the world and in courts across the world &ndash; and particularly in Africa.This is the day Kenyans should feel extremely proud of themselves as we have demonstrated that we are leading the way in Africa in entrenchment of democracy.This is the day we will be telling our children and grandchildren about. Such a judgment is the first in Africa and the only concern going forward is that, despite the warnings that have been given in the judgment in the closing remarks by Chief Justice David Maraga that it would be the expectations of the apex court that the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission should conduct fresh elections within 60 days - in strict compliance with the Constitution and other election laws.Having found out that the conduct of the Presidential election did not meet the requirements of the law so badly that the court had to invalidate it, the concern now is: Can the current IEBC do the new poll? Investigations should be conducted and criminal prosecutions undertaken for those who are responsible for interference with the 12th General Election.Okore is the President of the Law Society of Kenya
