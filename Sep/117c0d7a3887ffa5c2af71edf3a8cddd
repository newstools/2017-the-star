NASA MPs have defended co-principal Musalia Mudavadi and Siaya Senator James Orengo (pictured) over claims by Jubilee leaders that they also hacked into the IEBC server. JP through secretary general Raphael Tuju demanded the immediate arrest of Orengo and Mudavadi. ODM director of elections Junet Mohamed and other leaders told off Tuju, saying there is no way the two could have hacked the server to obtain or change data. “If at all they hacked the system, it would be to the favour of our flagbearer Raila Odinga,” the Suna East MP said. Junet spoke during a NASA rally in Ugunja town on Sunday. Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi told Orengo and Mudavadi to ignore the matter. Orengo laughed off  Tuju’s demands for his arrest, saying Tuju is a junior person who should not to talk about elected leaders, especially those in NASA.
