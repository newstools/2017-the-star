Many men leave their wives for giving birth to disabled children in Mavoko, Machakos county, an NGO has revealed. Doors of Hope NGO programme director Jacqueline Shibalira said retrogressive culture, myths and misconception have pushed many men to belief their wives are responsible for siring disabled children. She spoke during a cerebral palsy education drive in Mlolongo town yesterday. Shibalira said it is unfair for men to abandon their families. “Men should stop victimising their wives for giving birth to disabled children. May be they [men] are the cause of the disability,” she said. Shibalira said the situation had made many women from the region hopelessly poor as they single-handedly struggle to raise children with disability. “Mothers with disabled children, especially those suffering from cerebral palsy, go through difficulties. They are forced to stay at home to care for the children. They suffer from stigmatisation and rejection,” she said.
