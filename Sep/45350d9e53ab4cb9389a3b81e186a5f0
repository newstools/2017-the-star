The Siaya assembly failed to resume operations following Governor Cornel Rasangaâ€™s (pictured) absence. Rasanga is said to have been out of the country on official duty, but the communication reached the assembly late. Siaya speaker George Okode said the governor had communicated his absence through a memo and rescheduled the opening for September 20. Okode pointed out that despite the delay in the opening of the second assembly, it will continue conducting its business as usual. He said the election of key leaders, including chairpersons of house committees, would proceed as scheduled. Okode said the positions of chief whip and majority leaders have been filled by Joannes Andiego(South Sakwa ward) and Peter Odero (Ugunja) respectively.
