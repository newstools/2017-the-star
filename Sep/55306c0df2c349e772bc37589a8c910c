Embakasi East MP Babu Owino was re-arrested yesterday, minutes after he was released on a Sh500,000 cash bail. Owino was arrested outside Milimani law courts and taken to Kileleshwa Police station. Police say he was apprehended for inciting the public to violence on his Facebook page. Owino reportedly posted that he will not apologise over his ‘mtoto wa mbwa’ remarks. Before his arrest, a confrontation ensued between his lawyers and the prosecution and saw police lob teargas to disperse them. The MP was grabbed by CID officers and bundled into a police van.
