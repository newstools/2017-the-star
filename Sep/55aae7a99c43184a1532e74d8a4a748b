Supporters of Embakasi East MP Babu Owino have blocked a number of roads in Embakasi protesting his arrest. The first time legislator was arrested by DCI officers on Monday for referring to President Uhuru Kenyatta as a puppy. He spent the night at Pangani police station and will be charged this morning at the Milimani law courts. His followers have used boulders and wigs to block the roads inconveniencing motorists. Babu was processed at the DCI headquarters before he was transferred to the station, popular for hosting leaders indicted for hate speech allegations. Before his arrest, the MP dared police to seize him and put him in the cell for the remarks saying no one has ever died for sleeping in a cell. There was drama at the DCI and Pangani when police said they were under instructions from 'above' to deny the MP's lawyers led by James Orengo and his family from talking to him. Orengo protested the move and termed it unconstitutional and added the dark days are here.
