Nurses will meet tomorrow to discuss their next move after the Labour Court declared their strike illegal. Justice Hellen Wasilwa further ordered secretary general Seth Panyako (pictured) to call off the strike by Friday this week. She faulted the unionists for calling a strike without the mandatory notice, dismissing claims they issued the notice in November last year. &ldquo;It cannot therefore be alleged that the strike notice issued in November last year is the same one that can be used to call a new strike in June,&rdquo; Wasilwa said on Friday. She further ordered that Kenya National Union of Nurses&rsquo; chairman John Biiy be reinstated to the union team that is negotiating with the Health ministry and Council of Governors. Unless they successfully appeal the ruling or seek stay orders, the officials will be in contempt of court if they don&rsquo;t stop their strike this week. &ldquo;The National Governing Council will meet on Tuesday in Nairobi to deliberate what to do,&rdquo; one official told the Star. Wasilwa&rsquo;s orders were directed at Panyako, his deputy Maurice Opetu, treasurer Agnes Munderu and other union officers Joseph Ngwassi and Asha Ali. Biiy, who is among those opposed to the strike and in favour of dialogue, said he expects his colleagues to comply with the ruling. &ldquo;Panyako and his faction called the strike, when negotiations were ongoing and were about to bear fruit. They are responsible for denying the nurses a CBA,&rdquo; he said.The strike was called by KNUN on June 5, to demand registration of their draft CBA.
