Mwamba RFC&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Horace Otieno has been suspended from all rugby for four weeks following a judicial hearing into a misconduct charge during a Kabeberi Sevens&acirc;&#128;&#153; match against Nondescripts on September 9.The former Kenya Sevens international was found in breach of World Rugby Regulation 20.4b by way of engaging in a conduct that would bring the game into disrepute and did not uphold the spirit of the Laws of the Game (in breach of clause 1.2 of the Code of Conduct).World Rugby Regulation 20.4(b) defines Misconduct to include: acting in an abusive, insulting, intimidating or offensive manner towards referees, assistant referees, citing commissioners, members of disciplinary tribunals or other officials or any person associated with the host union, the rugby body or the unions participating in the match or spectators.Otieno will now miss the remainder of the national Sevens circuit (the Prinsloo tournament in Nakuru, Sepetuka in Eldoret, Dala in Kisumu and the Christie in Nairobi).Elsewhere, Nationwide side Stormers received a Sh2m worth of sponsorship from Kenya Civil Aviation Authority. The Nairobi-based side will now be known as KCAA Stormers RFC and will don the kits bearing KCAA name starting with the Prinsloo 7s this weekend.The deal is valid for one year but renewable for up to three years. Stormers RFC chairman Kennedy Wasonga says he&acirc;&#128;&#153;s delighted to have KCAA sponsor them as it will help them in their operations starting with the weekend circuit tournament.
