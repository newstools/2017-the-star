Nangina Ward MCA in Busia John Obwogo has called for the unconditional return of all security officers to NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga, running mate Kalonzo Musyok, and co-principal Musalia Mudavadi. Speaking in his ward during the World Contraceptive Day, Obwogo said it wasunfair to withdraw the NASA leaders’ security on Monday night. “ I am appealing to the national government through President Uhuru Kenyatta to lift that order —lest they be held responsible if anything happens to them,” he said. Obwogo has appealed to Busia residents to be peaceful before the repeat presidential poll on October 26. Everyone will need each other after the election, he said.
