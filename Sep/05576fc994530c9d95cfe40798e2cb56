Six students of Kimungui Boys’ Secondary School in Bungoma South, who suffered serious burns when their dorm burnt, have been admitted at Bungoma Referral Hospital. The form three students were in the dormitory on Saturday night when it caught fire. Other students were in the dining hall for entertainment. A medic, Job Waswa, told journalists some of the students became unconscious after inhaling a lot of smoke, but they are being treated. Injured boys could have started fire Police and CID officers are investigating five of the admitted students in hospital. The Bungoma South Education officer said the fire caused a lot of damage to students’ property estimated at Sh1.3 million. The fire could have been started by some students as police found a container smelling of petrol beside the dorm, he said. Journalists visited the school on Sunday and a student told them the fire could have been caused by some students who were aggrieved by the school’s management. The fire incident comes barely a week after students of Bungoma High School were forced to go home when they attempted to set ablaze a dormitory. It was alleged that the students were aggrieved after a teacher beat up an epileptic student, who then fainted, forcing them to go on the rampage. Bungoma South OCPD David Kirui warned students against torching schools as it puts the lives of other students at risk. “Police will treat any student found guilty of setting a school ablaze as a criminal and will act as an example to the rest by facing the full wrath of the law,” he said. On September 2, a dormitory in Moi Girls’ High School Nairobi burnt and nine students were killed and others injured. More fires have been reported in schools countrywide.
