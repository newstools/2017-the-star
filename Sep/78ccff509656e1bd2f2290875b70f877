Expectant mothers in Kibera will now be able to undergo free ultrasound scanning before 24 weeks of gestation.This is after firm General Electric donated six portable ultrasound machines and two monitors to the charity Shining Hope for Communities Organisation (Shofco).The equipment is worth Sh2.5 million. Services expectant women will receive free include consultation, medical examinations and drugs.The 24-week cutoff allows clinicians to accurately estimate the gestational age and improves detection of foetal anomalies.Twenty-two-year-old Auma Odhiambo, who is six months pregnant, had her first ultrasound yesterday.&acirc;&#128;&#156;I am happy I got to see my baby. I am also grateful I did not have to pay for the service,&acirc;&#128;&#157; Odhiambo said.Shofco health officer Naomi Kiiru said about 200 women are enrolled for an antenatal programme every month. The facility has four satellite clinics and one main facility.The main facility receives about 300 patients every day and the satellite clinics can handle 250 daily.Shofco is a grassroots movement that operates in Nairobi slums and seeks to improve access to maternal healthcare. GE has trained Shofco staff on how to use the equipment.GE East Africa general manager Andrew Waititu said slum dwellers lack access to quality healthcare and are more vulnerable to HIV-Aids and malnutrition among children.Maternal and child mortality rates among slum dwellers are about 50 per cent higher than the national average, he said.The under-five mortality rate is 64 in every 1,000 live births.Lack of access to proper care during and immediately after delivery contributes to high mother and child mortality.Shofco co-founder Kennedy Odede said most health facilities in the slums lack equipment.
