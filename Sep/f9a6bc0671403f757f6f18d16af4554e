NASA MPs in Nairobi yesterday promised to deliver more than 1.2 million votes to Raila Odinga in the October 17 repeat Presidential election.Headed by former Governor Evans Kidero and former Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama, they said they will lead Raila&rsquo;s city campaigns and safeguard his votes from theft and manipulation.They held a strategy meeting at Panafric Hotel.&ldquo;The meeting today was about the upcoming election. We want to guard our presidential candidate&rsquo;s votes so Jubilee does not steal them again,&rdquo; Muthama said.He said the MPs will coordinate campaigns in their constituencies in collaboration with MCAs. They will also be Raila&rsquo;s agents in the electoral areas.Justice equals peaceMuthama said Raila&rsquo;s agents in most polling stations were harassed and some kicked out to make it possible to manipulate results without scrutiny.MPs Anthony Oluoch (Mathare), Esther Passaris (woman rep), George Aladwa (Makadara), Ken Okoth (Kibra), Simba Arati (Dagoretti North), Tim Wanyonyi (Westlands) and Tom Kajwang&rsquo; (Ruaraka) attended the meeting.Muthama and Kidero led Raila&rsquo;s city campaigns before the last poll.Kidero said the opposition leader won, but was rigged out as &ldquo;confirmed by the Supreme Court&rdquo;.&ldquo;Justice must be done. We want peace and peace can only come when there is justice. Raila won the election and Kenyans will confirm this next month,&rdquo; he said.Respect rule of lawAsked on whether he will petition Governor Mike Sonko&rsquo;s win, Kidero said, &ldquo;justice will be done.&rdquo;The leaders criticised President Uhuru Kenyatta and Jubilee politicians for attacking CJ David Maraga and the other Supreme Court Judges for last Friday&rsquo;s ruling. They nullified Uhuru&rsquo;s win.Muthama said the attacks were unwarranted, and clearly show Uhuru has no respect for the rule of law.&ldquo;They were telling Raila and NASA to respect the verdict of the Supreme Court. But when the verdict was out, they changed their tune and started attacking the Judiciary, calling Maraga and other judges wakora [thugs],&rdquo; he said.Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto have publicly criticised the Judiciary, and yet said they respect the ruling.
