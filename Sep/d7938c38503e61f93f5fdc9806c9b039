Murang’a Senator Irungu Kang’ata has asked his Busia counterpart Amos Wako to explain allegations that he has a relationship with a Supreme Court Judge. Irungu said if is true that Wako has a relationship with Justice Philomena Mwilu, he ought to have disclosed it before the court so that lawyers could apply for her to disqualify herself from the presidential petition. Recent reports in a section of the media indicate Wako has had a relationship with the judge for two decades. Irungu said Wako committed professional negligence by failing to disclose his relationship with the judge. “It is against the ethics of the Law Society of Kenya to fail to disclose a relationship with a judge that may affect the outcome of a case,” Irungu said. Irungu was speaking at Ndaka-ini town in Gatanga during a presidential campaign caravan organised by local MPs. Gatanga MP Joseph Nduati, Murang’a woman representative Sabina Chege, Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro, Kandara MP Alice Wahome, Mathioya MP Peter Kimari, Kigumo MP Ruth Mwaniki and Maragua MP Mary Njoroge urged voters to come out in large numbers and reelect President Uhuru Kenyatta on October 26. For his part, Kimari urged residents to mark ballot papers correctly. In the August 8 General Election, he said there were over 14,000 spoilt votes in the Murang’a. The Mathioya MP said some voters wasted ballot papers by making unnecessary marks. “People need to be taught how to vote properly. We need to safeguard every vote and ensure the President wins by a landslide,” Kimari said. Ndindi said NASA’s calls for a caretaker government are outrageous and should not be taken seriously. He said Uhuru is still the President until a fresh election.
