Two MPs from Nakuru have asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to reward the county with a cabinet slot. Bahati MP Kimani Ngunjiri (pictured)and his Nakuru East counterpart David Gikaria said the region has been overlooked in recent appointments despite its huge significance in the country’s political affairs.  “In the just concluded elections, our county was rated third in giving Jubilee votes hence a reason for a reward. Our political significance should lead to greater fruits for the region,” said Gikaria. Youths also raised similar concerns yesterday, saying they want their elected leaders to negotiate for their share of the national cake. “The inability of the leaders to negotiate for our share of the national cake has had catastrophic results in appointments and development projects,” said Japhet Omar, a Nakuru youth.
