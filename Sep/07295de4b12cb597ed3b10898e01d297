Public Works PS Mariam El-Maawy died in a South African hospital yesterday. She succumbed to injuries she suffered during an attack by al Shabaab on July 14 in Milihoi, Lamu. The PS was rescued by elite KDF soldiers after al Shabaab militants attacked her convoy and abducted her. Seven people, among them police officers
guarding were killed. President Uhuru Kenyatta paid glowing tribute to the late PS, describing her as a dedicated public servant. "Her achievement, her expertise, her public spirit and her spirit of patriotism meant that it was a pleasure for President Kenyatta to invite her to join his administration as Principal Secretary for Lands - and later as Principal Secretary for Public Works - in the Ministry of Lands and Housing," State House spokesman Manoah Esipisu said in a statement. "She served with distinction in both offices, and her loss will certainly be felt." She was airlifted her to Nairobi, before she was transferred to South Africa for specialised treatment. Heavily armed militants shot the PS in the shoulder and on her legs after abducting her. El-Maawy and her entourage were attacked after attending an official state function in the area. KDF officers swung into action about 45 minutes after the PS and her entourage were attacked. During the attack, the militia took control of the PSâ€™s
vehicle, which had six occupants and sped off into a thicket. Her nephew, a trainee pilot, with whom she was with, was killed by the militants.
