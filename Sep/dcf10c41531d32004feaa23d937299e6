A man died instantly when he was hit by a speeding vehicle and his head severed on the Karatina-Nyeri highway on Tuesday. He could not immediately be identified. The victim was talking to the driver of another vehicle who had pulled to the side of the road near Kanyama at around 1.30pm. He was hit by a Toyota Probox and tossed several metres into the air before landing on the bonnet of an oncoming vehicle. His head and torso lay several metres apart before they were collected by police officers and taken to Karatina District Hospital morgue.
