Jubilee politician Gideon Mung'aro has denied taking Sh4.5 million meant to pay more than 900 Kilifi party agents for the August 8 polls. County chief agent Najma Mangi on Saturday accused Mung'aro of failing to pay the agents. "That woman should stop soiling my name. As candidates, we don't know who appointed her and I did not taking anyone's money. She was chased in Malindi and now she wants to use my name to salvage herself. Let her carry her own cross," Mung'aro said. The agents are now threatening to boycott the October 17 repeat election
and decamp to NASA. Each was reportedly meant to get Sh4,000. "Until today we have not received even a single coin yet we worked day and night to monitor the Jubilee votes," Najma said. She said they were told at the Jubilee head office that Mung'aro was given money meant for agents. "But he has gone into hiding and no longer picks our calls," she added. Agents who accompanied Najma said she is being used as a sacrificial lamb by Mung'aro who failed to deliver votes for the Jubilee party. Mung'aro lost his bid for the Kilifi Governor seat in the August 8 polls. More on this: Big loss for Jubilee as ODM clinches all top Kilifi seats
