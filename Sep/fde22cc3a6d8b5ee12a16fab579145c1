Smart automation, advanced robotics and 3-D printing are new factors affecting opportunities for export-led manufacturing in developing countries, a new World Bank report shows. The three, among other innovations, are being incorporated by manufacturers of cars, electronics, apparel, consumer and other goods are shifting how countries and firms compete for production. The report, dubbed Trouble in the Making? The Future of Manufacturing-Led Development, finds that these advances in technology and changing trade patterns are influencing which locations are attractive for production. “Technology and globalization are changing how manufacturing contributes to development. We will need to embrace this change rather than fear it,” said World Bank Group’s senior director for trade & competitiveness Annabel Gonzalez. She recommends developing countries to update their policies along with their infrastructure, firm up capabilities and job creation strategies to meet the demands of a more-technologically advanced world. In addition, the report recommends that countries seeking to bolster their manufacturing sectors should seek new contracting relationships that embrace new technologies, give workers new sets of skills and promote connectedness to emphasize openness to trade in goods.
