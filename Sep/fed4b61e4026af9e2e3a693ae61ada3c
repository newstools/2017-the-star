Success has a few drawbacks. One of which is: the plateau (or comfort zone). Here, you reach your goals, settle to enjoy the spoils and stay there. Instead of setting new goals and embracing fresh challenges, you buy into the notion that you&acirc;&#128;&#153;ve &acirc;&#128;&#156;arrived&acirc;&#128;&#157; and nothing else is worth pursuing. What plateau dwellers fail to realize is that there&acirc;&#128;&#153;s always the next level. Success is a peak-less mountain. One point opens up a higher level. Each idea accomplished ushers you to a higher expression of that idea. Are you ready to keep climbing? Some people reach a certain level of success and stop growing. And if you stop growing, success stops growing. How do you avoid the plateau? Consider these three thoughts. The Push: The comfort zone is cozy and difficult to leave because it is familiar and functional. Those who succeed in moving beyond this point push through it. They make radical efforts to break the hold of the warmth of the plateau. So, how do you find the strength to push? This comes from an understanding that your potential is limitless. What you&acirc;&#128;&#153;ve achieved is not a summary of all you can achieve. There&acirc;&#128;&#153;s so much more you can do &acirc;&#128;&#147; greater heights to attain. The Price: Every level of success comes at a price. And as you go higher, you pay a higher price. That&acirc;&#128;&#153;s how it works. As you go up, you must give up something. Normally, you let go of what used to work at one level to advance to the next. The question is: What are you willing to give up to go up? What price are you willing to pay? I know you would like to become CEO, but are you willing to leave the comfort zone of marketing manager to go higher? Are you willing to leave what you understand for the unknown? Only those who are ready to pay the price move to the next level. The Work: You must understand that the level of challenge on your current station is nothing like the next level. It helps to have the right mental poise for the work required at the next stage. As you aspire for greater heights, do you understand the work required to attain it? Success on higher plains normally demands a level of sophistication that your current position lacks. The skill level required to walk around the block isn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t the same needed to prepare for the Olympics. Get ready for more work.Twitter: @SamuelMpamugoBlog: theyouideology.com
