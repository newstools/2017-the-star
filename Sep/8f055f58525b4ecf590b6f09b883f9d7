Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka (in white shirt), Jubilee MPs and MCAs in Bungoma county are under pressure to deliver votes for President Uhuru Kenyatta during the October 17 presidential polls. So tense is the pressure the county leaders have been spending sleepless nights attending strategic meetings across the county. A source told the Star the leaders want to ensure Uhuru gets all the 173,000 votes Lusaka got during the August 8 governor race. Bungoma, the home to NASA co-principal Moses Wetang’ula, is considered a NASA zone and its presidential candidate Raila Odinga garnered 283,000 votes in the August 8 polls against Uhuru’s 130,000. NASA MPs, led by county boss Wycliffe Wangamati, have also been busy campaigning for Raila. Wangamati has vowed to vigorously campaign for Raila and ensure all votes go to the NASA basket. “This time round, I’m going to lead Raila’s campaigns in the county. We will make sure he is our next President. I’m asking our supporters to convince other supporters to vote for Raila,” he said.
