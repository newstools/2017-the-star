While we support freedom of speech, baseless attacks and lies must stop," he said in a statement on Tuesday.Godec said leaders on both sides of the political divide should work to ensure hate speech ends as they risk undermining Kenya's constitution."They should ensure the safety of those wrongly attacked, including members of our own mission."The ambassador added authorities should hold to account those responsible for hate speech and incitement."A successful poll will require goodwill and flexibility from leaders and citizens alike. Politics must not be a matter of life or death," he said.Godec urged Kenyans to keep the peace and respect the constitution, its values and the institutions it established. "As partners, we stand with Kenyans who seek to move the country forward and strengthen democracy."He said they will continue working with IEBC and the public to ensure the fresh presidential election is free, fair, and credible.
