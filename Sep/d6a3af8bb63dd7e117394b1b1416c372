The weekend promises an exhilarating sense of entertainment for polo fans and enthusiasts in the high goal Kenya International Open which rolls off on Friday at the Jamhuri grounds, Nairobi. The Nairobi Polo Club hosts the prestigious annual man-and-horse showpiece the next two weekends. This weekend will feature an eight-goal polo extravaganza in the main cup, while the 12-goal tournament will be next in line. Nairobi Polo Club, under the leadership of chairman Philip Arungah, in conjunction with Kenya Polo Association have flown in mid-handicap players from different countries for the tournament. Handicap four, James Murray said the action-packed event will provide players a ground to learn and improve their game. Murray, the country’s highest handicap player, captained the national team against South Africa last Sunday. Kenya lost to hosts South Africa 7-6 in extra time after tying 6-6 in five chukkas in the annual Prince of Wales Polo Cup staged at the Rosefield Polo Club, Centurion, SA. The two sides were at the top of their game with the host being on the back end of their season, while Kenya is mid-season. “It was a great exposure in South Africa. Playing in a different environment, against unfamiliar players and riding someone else’s horses gave us an all-new experience. The Kenya International is going to be extremely fantastic because we will be playing our own ponies,” he said “This weekend presents other players the chance to play against foreign players and there will be several opportunities to learn and improve,” said Murray, who was accompanied by three-goaler Archie Voorspuy and handicap two duo of Mbugua Ngugi and Tiva Gross. Gross was awarded the Most Valuable Player of the tournament and Murray commended her display off the ball.
