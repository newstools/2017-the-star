David Makali has resigned from Amani National Congress days after losing the Bungoma Senator seat in the August 8 election. "Being a registered and paid life member, I hereby tender my resignation as a member of ANC effective today," he said in a letter dated August 18. The letter addressed to the secretary general Geoffrey Osotsi was received on September 8. Makali joined NASA principal Musalia Mudavadi's party after ditching former Budalang'i MP Ababu Namwamba of Labour Party of Kenya. The veteran journalist sought the party's nomination to contest the Bungoma Senator seat. But he lost to Moses Wetang'ula who is Ford Kenya Party leader and a NASA principal. Makali quit LPK on March 20 and resigned from his role as secretary general after falling out with Namwamba. The two differed on the party's preferred candidate for the presidency amid preparations for the August 8 poll.
