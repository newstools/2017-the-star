Celebrated Kenyan-Norwegian artiste Stella Mwangi is still making waves! Her song Get Up and Go, off her self-titled EP, has been picked for yet another commercial deal with world-renowned fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger, this time for â€œTommy Nowâ€.  Earlier in the year, her single, titled Work, was featured on the Tommy Hilfiger Summer Spring Collection.  Get Up and Go will be used as the theme record for the Tommy Hilfiger runway fashion shows for a whole year and on digital campaigns and promotions to kick off the Tommy Now Fall Winter 2017 collection.  Check out the song on Tommy Now Rock Circus Fall 2017 Show. The models for the new collection, who included the Hadid sisters, strutted down the runway to Get Up and Go at this high-profile Tommy Now Fall Winter 2017 Fashion Show live stream in London during the London Fashion Week. Speaking about this big news, an ecstatic Stella said, â€œThis whole year, my fans have been sending me messages congratulating my team about this Hollywood EP, but at the same time, theyâ€™re quite pissed, saying that I have abandoned them somehow. Well, I just want you all to know that Iâ€™m still STL, the queen of Hip Hop, and Iâ€™ve got some heated records lined up for you. Iâ€™m on to some other hustle real quick! Donâ€™t worry; Iâ€™ll be back before you all know it. Nawapenda woh!â€ Following the success of her Stella Mwangi EP ( 2016 ) in Hollywood and across Europe, Stella is currently working on her second Hollywood EP album. Now on its final stages, the new record will position her on a global stage for more Hollywood productions in 2018.  This is not the first score for Stella. Her hit single, Set It Off, was featured on Being Mary Jane season 4, with Get Up and Go being taken up as a soundtrack for Rosewood Season 2.  Fans reacted to the news:  James Kimari: Yooo! Why isnâ€™t this song big in Kenya like it is in Europe? Itâ€™s really fresh. Cate Wanjau: Go gal go! Itali Kasa: STL You are the Kenyan Queen Bee, StelloncÃ©.
