Online shopping portal Jumia intends to disrupt the grocery, beauty and baby products industry by introducing at least 700,000 new products by end of this year.The product increase will move Jumia&acirc;&#128;&#153;s total product catalogue to a total of 1 million, up from 300,000 this year, and 30,000 in 2016.At least four to 6.5 million people visit the platform on a monthly basis with about 35 per cent purchasing grocery, beauty and baby products.This announcement comes on the back of a volatile retail sector that has seen giants such as Nakumatt and Uchumi close a number of branches while at the same time seeking financial bailout to remain stable.&acirc;&#128;&#156;Retail is quite developed in Kenya; however, increase of empty shelves in supermarkets, rising questions on the quality of stocks sealed with price fluctuations has prompted us to get into the market,&acirc;&#128;&#157; Jumia Kenya managing director Sam Chappatte said.The move is informed by increasing penetration of internet in the country which stands at 85 per cent as reported in the Communications Authority 2015-2016 annual report, reduced cost of smartphones which has gone down from an approximate Sh25, 000 to Sh10, 000 and the improving price of data.Jumuia&acirc;&#128;&#153;s announcement also comes at a time when telecommunications firm Safaricom is planning to launch Masoko, its pilot entry project in the e-commerce industry.&acirc;&#128;&#156;We are building our merchant and vendors portfolio, we remain very confident until October when we will launch depending on how the electoral commission timetable dates are,&acirc;&#128;&#157; Safaricom chief executive Bob Collymore said last Friday during the firm&acirc;&#128;&#153;s annual general meeting.Jumia, which has signed at least 200 delivery partnerships, with at least 101 pickup stations across the country, said the entrance of Masoko is a positive thing as many people will learn about e-commerce through its launch.&acirc;&#128;&#156;Masoko will come, it is a good opportunity, and they will educate millions of customers who will later make a rational decision which will narrow down to price, experience and range of products,&acirc;&#128;&#157; Chappatte said.Kenya&acirc;&#128;&#153;s online retail penetration currently stands at 0.5 per cent which is equivalent to Africa&acirc;&#128;&#153;s penetration.India&acirc;&#128;&#153;s penetration stands at 4 per cent while China and United Kingdom&acirc;&#128;&#153;s penetration stands at 13.8 per cent and 15.2 per cent respectively.According to data by Jumia, the growth of retail penetration starts to pick up from the sixth year and while at this point the growth rate moves 10 times faster that from year one to five.
