Homa Bay Governor Cyprian Awiti has urged MCAs to debate relevant issues affecting residents and to work in harmony with the executive. “I wish members of this county to focus on issues regarding the resources bestowed on the county. The executive and assembly must work in harmony to achieve our goals,” he said Awiti spoke when he opened the assembly on Tuesday. He said the county’s growth lies in the hands of the executive and the MCAs. The governor urged members of the executive and the assembly to respect each other. “The assembly should be instrumental in pushing for development-oriented Bills,” Awiti said. Awiti also told the assembly to focus on industrialisation and agriculture to enhance job creation. The governor is expected to present to the assembly a list of his nominees for the county executive.
