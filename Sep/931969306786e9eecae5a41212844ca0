NAC Rally Team duo of Pawel Molgo and Piotr Domownik are hoping to exorcise the ghosts of 2015 when they return for this year&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Kenya Airways East African Safari Classic Rally set for November 23-December 1 in Kenya and Tanzania.Boosting of a new Mercedes car, Molgo and Domownik are hopeful of realising the goals that evaded them two years ago. Molgo&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Mercedes 450SLC (Car No 35) was among the few cars which didn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t start Day 7 of the 2015 Safari Classic. However, the duo revealed that their new car has undergone several performance tests for nearly half a year, during which faults were eliminated to avoid any surprises in two months time. Molgo said the car successfully passed the final test at the Szuter Cup Rally in Miko&Aring;&#130;ajki, whose route partly covered special sections of the prestigious Rally of Poland.&acirc;&#128;&#156;The violent storm that turned gravel roads into mudflow was a foretaste of what racers might expect in less than two months in Kenya. Although Piotr and I are born off-roaders, the difficulties we experienced during the previous edition of East African Safari Classic Rally surprised us very much. That edition proved to be as demanding as the most famous cross-country marathons and yet we fought in the rally with a car that is not an off-roader! I think we will be better prepared now and the equipment will not disappoint us. My goal this year is to go through a set of special sections and to be in the highest possible position in the final classification,&acirc;&#128;&#157; said Molgo.&acirc;&#128;&#156;The Safari Classic is the essence of everything we love. It combines exoticism, classic motorization, high rallying demands and off-road driving. The event takes place in a very friendly atmosphere. Memories of the routes, stages and camps will stay with me for years. What more could we want? Molgo posed. The NAC duo are among the most experienced and award-winning off-road stalwarts from Poland hoping to make a mark on the Safari Classic. The duo have for years raced in rallies of championship repute besides some of the most challenging international competitions like the Africa Eco Race and Silk Way Rally.&acirc;&#128;&#156;We already feel sentimental towards our red &acirc;&#128;&#152;devil&acirc;&#128;&#153;, so we have remained faithful to Mercedes brand, which has had many successes in marathon rallies,&acirc;&#128;&#157; added Moldo. &acirc;&#128;&#156;However, we felt that the manual transmission was better for us. And since cars participating in competitions have to be type-approved, we were forced to &acirc;&#128;&#152;downsize&acirc;&#128;&#153; the car. We do not complain though, because the new engine has similar power to the previous one. Of course the whole unit was dismantled and underwent a thorough overhaul, gaining, among other things, forged pistons. We moved some equipment from the previous car to the new one &acirc;&#128;&#147; including elements of suspension and safety cage. However, we decided to remove air conditioning, which last time turned out to be redundant. We have improved the cabin&acirc;&#128;&#153;s clean air supply and we are most pleased with the lower weight of the car!&acirc;&#128;&#157; Molgo said in finality.
