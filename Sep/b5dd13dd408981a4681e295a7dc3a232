A woman who threw her poo out of her date's toilet window because it "would not flush" had to be rescued after she got stuck trying to retrieve it.The amateur gymnast was on a first date with Bristol student Liam Smith when she "panicked" and threw the faeces out of the window.It did not land in the garden, but became wedged between two non-opening windows.After climbing in head first after it, she became wedged.Smith had to call the fire brigade for help.The story appeared on a crowdfunding page, set up by the University of Bristol student.Smith, who is raising funds to fix his broken window, wrote that he was on a Tinder date with the woman and they went back to the shared house he lives in."We'd had a really nice evening," he said. "We'd had a meal at a well-known chicken restaurant, had a few beers and then gone back to mine for a bottle of wine and a film."He said the woman went to the toilet and when she came back she had a "panicked look in her eye" and told him what she had done.He said the toilet window opened into a narrow gap separated by another double glazed window."It was into this twilight zone that my date had thrown her poo," he said.He went to find a hammer to smash the window, but she decided to "climb in head first" after the "offending package" and became jammed."I was starting to grow concerned, so I called the fire brigade and once they had composed themselves, they set to work removing her from the window."Although the woman was rescued unharmed, Smith said his bathroom window was destroyed."I'm not complaining, they did what they had to do," he said."Problem is, I've been quoted north of &pound;300 to replace the window and as a postgraduate student, that is a significant chunk of my monthly budget."Smith originally set a crowdfunding target of &pound;200, but has already raised more than &pound;1,200.He said he and his date had decided to split the extra cash between two charities, one supporting firefighters and another that builds and maintains flushing toilets in developing countries.Unsurprisingly, the woman does not want to be named but Mr Smith said he had seen her since and "who knows what the future holds"."We had a lovely night on the second date but it's too early to say if she's the one. But we got on very very well and she's a lovely girl," he said."And we've already got the most difficult stuff out of the way first."Avon Fire and Rescue service confirmed it had received a call and freed a woman trapped between external and double glazing.It also confirmed that a "window was broken in the process".
