A section of leaders from Siaya County have told off Attorney General Githu Muigai over claims that President Uhuru Kenyatta still has executive powers. Muigai had stated that there will be no constitutional crisis in this country if elections are not held within the 60 days as directed by the Supreme Court. He pointed that President Uhuru will still remain in office, with full executive powers until a new president is sworn in. But former Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo said Uhuru is illegally in office since his term ended on August 8, 2017. Similar sentiments were echoed by Alego/Usonga MP Samuel Atandi. Atandi asked NASA supporters to be ready to swear in Raila Odinga if repeat elections are not held as was directed by the Supreme Court. He said Raila won the August 8, election and that Kenya should be ready for two presidents if Uhuru refuses to leave office. The two leaders spoke during a rally in Bondo town on Saturday. The rally was addressed by NASA leader Raila Odinga.
