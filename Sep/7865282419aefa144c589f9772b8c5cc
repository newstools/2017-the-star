Doreen Gatwiri is one of the fast-rising TV personalities in town. The lass, who hosts Kiswahili news for Ebru TV, seems to be fed up with city women trying to live a life like hers — only that they want hers. In an exclusive interview with Word Is, we sought to find out her relationship status. It turns out she is the wife of  a renowned city architect-cum-politician, whose name she didn’t reveal. Her man is one of the richest tycoons Nairobi has ever seen, but it seems there are women who have been ‘nyemelearing’ him, something Doreen does not like, at all! The sexy, hot and talented screen siren opened up to Word Is as she indirectly poured out words that we figured were directed to women who might be salivating over her husband. “They want to have your life, wannabe husband snatchers. Broke wannabes, cheap. Go fix your foreheads, accent and ratchetness,” she said. The TV queen went ahead to give advice, saying, “You can never have my life or someone else’s.” This does not come as a shock, as the sponsor bug is real. Young ladies are thirsting over rich men, trying to get the easy way out of making it.
