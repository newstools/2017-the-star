Deputy President William Ruto’s allies in the North Rift have pledged to deliver the region’s 1.7 million votes for President Uhuru Kenyatta on October 17. Elected Jubilee leaders have beeen meeting to plan for the presidential election, as ordered by the Supreme Court. The court nullified Uhuru’s victory on September 1, citing irregularities and illegalities. It said the poll was not conducted according to the Constitution. Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago, his Nandi counterpart Stephen Sang and Alex Tolgos of Elgeyo Marakwet have began mobilising groups to campaign door to door. “All Jubilee MPs, senators, MCAs and woman representatives will hit the campaign trail. We urge voters to support the President and the DP,” Sang said. He addressed the Nandi county assembly on Tuesday when MCAs were asked to seek votes for the President. “I urge all of us to join hands and campaign to get Jubilee back to power. “Let us all mobilise voters to come out in large numbers and vote for Uhuru. Every vote counts,” Sang said. He expressed disappointment that the Supreme Court nullified the August 8 presidential election over what he called “minor clerical mistakes” by the IEBC. Sang has been a vocal supporter of the Jubilee administration. He has marshaled all MCAs, including those from NASA and independents, to back Uhuru and Ruto. Three opposition ward reps have declared support for Uhuru. They include Jackson Swadi (Kabwareng), Geoffrey Kevolwe (Kiptuiya) and Eliud Kirongo (Kapkangani). Mandago and Tolgos said they would ensure a high voter turnout. “We will even compete among ourselves to ensure we have a good turnout,” Tolgos said. Mandago was appointed to chair the campaigns team in the Rift Valley. Jubilee is trying to win back 10 former MPs and influential politicians in the North Rift who backed NASA on August 8.
