Busia county chief Health officer Akisa Ekisa has said the nurses and clinical officers’ strike will be solved after the county convenes a meeting with their union leaders. Speaking during World Contraceptive Day at Nangina Dispensary on Tuesday, Ekisa said Deputy Governor Moses Mulomi has promised to bring the striking health workers to the negotiating table as soon as possible. “The county government is determined to bring to an end the strike. The willingness by some nurses to support our event shows they too want the problem solved without further delay,” she said. Ekisa said Busia is on record as the first county to undertake promotion of Health workers, one of their demands. She said they want to end the stalemate. Busia First Lady Judy Ojaamong said the best way forward is to end the strike, which has paralysed services.
