Raila Odinga has disowned a House leaders' list and only assured slots for Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang'ula and Suba South MP John Mbadi. "Wetang'ula is the leader in the Senate and Mbadi in Parliament...there is no cause for alarm and there is no problem," he said on Monday.The NASA leader said the other slots will be negotiated when they meet as a coalition."What we know is we will sit down and agree on the leadership of the house...this will be something to be negotiated."Raila's remarks came hours after NASA CEO Norman Magaya rubbished a list of officials appointed in both Houses of Parliament saying it was not approved."The purported line-up doing rounds has not been approved by the leadership of NASA and the Parliamentary Group," he said.It was alleged that NASA picked Mbadi as National Assembly minority leader and Lugari's Ayub Savula as the deputy. Robert Mbui was reportedly chosen as the minority whip.More on this: List naming Mbadi minority leader not approved, says Magaya
