Kenya teams started their campaign for their respective events on a positive note with both the men and women&rsquo;s sides winning their matches yesterday.In South Africa, a remarkable display of power hitting from skipper Rakep Patel helped the national cricket team to a six-wicket win over Free State as they bowled off their Africa Twenty20 Cup campaign on a positive note while their women counterparts beat Tanzania by two wickets on the first day of the ICC Africa Twenty20 Qualifiers in Namibia.Chasing 147, the skipper led from the front with a spectacular knock of 74 off 44 balls, including ten boundaries and three sixes as Kenya won the Group &lsquo;C&rsquo; match with 10 balls to spare. Rakep scored 12 runs in the tenth over, bowled by A Rasemene, to bring up his 50 off just 33 deliveries. Rakep and his predecessor Collins Obuya put on 93 for the fourth wicket after Kenya had been reduced to 33 for 3 in 5.2 overs. Obuya (43 off 29) was more cautious than his partner in a stand that brought up 50 off 39 balls.The stand was brought to an end when LT Mdashe bowled Rakep with five overs to play. This paved way to an unbeaten fifth wicket stand of 23 between Obuya and Gurdeep Singh (8 not out).Rakep and Obuya were unified in the sixth over when Free State seamers CA Dry (1 for 15), SC van Schalwyk (1 for 23) and A. Rasamene (1 for 20) had dismissed Irfan Karim (4), Alex Obanda (5) and Dhiren Gondaria (11) in quick succession. Earlier, DS Rosier and JL du Plooy&rsquo;s saved the Free State innings with the two scoring 44 and 37 runs respectively.The two put on 49 for the third wicket after Free State had been reduced to 30 for 2 in five overs, thanks to Nehemiah Odhiambo and Nelson Mandela&rsquo;s dismissal of the openers for four and 13 runs. Odhiambo went on to break the Plooy-Rosier stand in the tenth over before adding two more to end on 4 for 23. In Namibia, the women team restricted Tanzania for 87 for 3 before reaching the target with an over to play for the loss of eight wicket.
