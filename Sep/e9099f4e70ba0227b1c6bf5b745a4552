Elected and former MPs in Kisii have accused Nyeri Town MP Ngunjiri Wambugu of being the Opposition's project. Ngunjiri filed a petition before the JSC for the removal of Chief Justice David Maraga following the Supreme Court ruling nullifying President Uhuru Kenyatta 's re-election. Uhuru asked the Jubilee politician to drop the petition after which it was withdrawn. But while drumming support for the President, Kisii leaders said Ngunjiri is Raila Odinga's project. "We know that Ngunjiri is Raila's project. He was in the forefront in
collecting signatures that facilitated Uhuru and Ruto's cases at the
ICC," Kitutu Chache North MP Jimmy Angwenyi claimed. The leaders said Uhuru deserves a second term in office because his administration has actualised its development pledges. They said they will ensure Uhuru gets more votes in the repeat election than he did on August 8. "We want to assure the President that we are going to do our best to ensure he scores more in the region," Angwenyi said on Friday. Nyaribari Chache MP Richard Tong'i expressed optimism that Uhuru will win by a bigger margin than in the first round. "We are calling upon residents wherever they are to turn up in large numbers on October 17 to vote for Uhuru," he said. He said they will move around the country within the remaining days to bag votes for Jubilee. Bobasi MP Innocent Obiri said he is ready to work with the national government to develop his constituency. Ex-MPs Zebedeo Opore, Hezron Manduku and Reuben Oyondi said they will not be left behind in campaigns for Uhuru's re-election, The leaders were speaking at Kiongongi village in Bobasi constituency during the burial mother to former MP Stephen Manoti.
