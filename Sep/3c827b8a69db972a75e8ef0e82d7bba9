One of Kenya’s funniest comedians, Eric Omondi, was accused of stepping out of Tekno Miles’ concert on Saturday while drunk. A video of the comedian was posted by one of his close friends on social media, where he looked like he was tipsy. Talking exclusively to Word Is, Eric denied the claims of ever going to the show, not to mention being drunk. “I was not drunk and further more, I didn’t attend the concert,” he rubbished the rumours. However, other people have stated that he attended the concert and even described his outfit.
