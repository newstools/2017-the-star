South Africa plans to table a special appropriation bill to parliament in the next month to request a 10 billion rand ($762 million) bailout for the struggling state airline, treasury's top official said on Wednesday. South African Airways, which runs one of Africa’s biggest fleets but is loss-making, is seeking a 13 billion rand bailout from government to pay off debts and keep its planes in the air. SAA said on Wednesday five narrow-body aircraft would be retired from its fleet by December, causing an overall flights reduction of 23 per cent, in a bid to return to profitability. "One narrow-body aircraft has left the fleet, with four more expected to leave the fleet by December 2017,” a presentation to legislators said. The airline runs one of Africa’s biggest fleets but is loss-making. It received state funds in July to help to repay debts and also depends on government debt guarantees of about 20 billion rand ($1.5 billion). ($1 = 13.0415 rand)
