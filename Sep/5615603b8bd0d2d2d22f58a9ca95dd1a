Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu yesterday declined to open the annual Law Society of Kenya Legal Awareness Week, despite having been invited - avoiding a potential showdown with the public. It would have been Mwilu’s first appearance in public following the nullification of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s victory, a decision she, Chief Justice David Maraga and justices Smoking Wanjala and Isaac Lenaola justified last Friday. It would also have been her first public appearance, after a petition was lodged before the Judicial Service Commission seeking her removal from office over gross misconduct during the hearing of the presidential petition lodged by NASA leader Raila Odinga. An invite to media houses sent by LSK communication officer Agnetta Rodi had indicated the DCJ was to be the chief guest at the event held at the Milimani law courts. “This year’s theme is “Safeguarding Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms through Improved Law Enforcement and the Guest of Honour will be the Deputy Chief Justice and Vice President of the Supreme Court, Philomena Mwilu, who will officially open the Legal Aid Week on Monday September 25, 2017 at 9am,” Rodi said. The Legal Awareness Week will run up to September 29 in the Milimani law courts parking yard and members of the public have been asked to take advantage and seek free advice. “We sent an invite to her on Friday but she declined, saying she had other commitments,” an officer from the LSK said. National Legal Aid Services Board chairperson Nazima Malik replaced the DCJ as the chief guest. Other speakers include Macharia Njeru, the chairman of Ipoa, Jedidah Wakonyo of the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights and LSK president Isaac Okero.
