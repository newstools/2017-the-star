The Communications Authority is under pressure to deny poll malpractices in the August 8 election, NASA leader Raila Odinga has said. This was part of Raila's response on Wednesday after CA director general Francis Wangusi's said he should stop engaging in blanket lynching’ of investors. Wangusi said this after Raila claimed one of Safaricom's VPNs terminated transmission of results, cutting links between KIEMs kits and IEBC servers.

"They are under pressure to respond. The data was transferred by Safaricom to the server in France. How did IEBC transfer it back to Kenya without using service providers?" Raila further said they have the powers to stop Kenyans from using certain providers. "The question we asked yesterday has not been addressed. We have the powers ..if they want to strangle democracy we won't allow that," he said. "We can tell our people not to buy services. That time is coming...it has not come yet." The Opposition leader had claimed the IEBC cloud server to which transmission was terminated is registered in Spain but operated from France by OT-Morpho - the KIEMS kits supplier. But Safaricom CEO Bob Collymore dismissed the claims saying the firm transmitted all election results from the KIEMS kits to IEBC servers as per laid down procedures.
