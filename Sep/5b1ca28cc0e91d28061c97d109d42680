Kenha has signed a Sh38 billion deal with the Kiambu government to build county highways and roads. They include James Gichuru-Rironi road, which will cost Sh16 billion, the Western Bypass, which passes through Wangige, Ndenderu and Ruaka and will cost Sh17 billion, and the Sh4 billion Ruiru-Githunguri-Uplands road. Kenha officials met Governor Ferdinand Waititu at the Kiambu headquarters in Kiambu town yesterday. They said contractors have been identified and work is ongoing on some roads. In total 13 roads will be built by Kenha, including the junction near Blue Post Thika interchange where the authority has acquired the road reserve, which will help ease traffic,” Waititu said. Kenha director general Peter Mundinia said it is crucial that the authority works with county governments and local leadership. “The support from local leadership has been good, even in other counties, and this has helped move those e who have encroached on roads and where road land has been grabbed,” he said.
