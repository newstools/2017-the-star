Budalang’i MP Raphael Wanjala’s wife Josephine has urged residents in the entire Busia county to turn up in large numbers and vote for NASA torchbearer Raila Odinga on October 17. Speaking at Seed of Abraham Christian Centre Ruambwa after attending service on Sunday, Josephine said residents should vote for NASA presidential flagbearer Raila because “the Jubilee government has not built any factory in Western and Nyanza region”. She said Jubilee has been boasting about Rai Paper factory in Webuye, but operations have stalled. “That is why I want to appeal to the people of Western region to wake up on October 17 and vote wisely for NASA flagbearer Raila Amolo Odinga because we have been neglected. Should you make the mistake of returning to office those who have failed us economically, we will be doomed and shall continue to face endless suffering,” Josephine said.
