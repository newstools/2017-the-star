NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga’s bid might suffer in Migori due to the poor relations between Kurias and Luos, a Kuria East politician has said. Tyson Kemege (pictured), who lost in ODM primaries to run for Kuria East MP, said party members from the community are finding it hard to campaign for Raila. He said ever since the IEBC set the October 17 date for the repeat of the presidential election, “we have nothing to say to the voters in favour of Raila in Kuria, because of the bad blood with our Luo brothers.” Kemege spoke to the press in Migori town on Saturday. He said the August 24 election of the Migori speaker, which was marred by chaos, will “kill” chances of Raila getting votes from the area. “We are facing a huge task to convince our brothers to vote along with our Luo brothers, when they have been made to feel like outsiders in Migori. The chaos witnessed during the speaker’s election was the last straw that broke the camel’s back,” Kemege said. He said the majority of Luos won the major county seats. They are Governor Okoth Obado, woman representative Pamela Odhiambo, Senator Oluoch Okello and all nominated MCAs. Kemege said despite ODM having four MCAs from Kuria, no member from the community was nominated in the assembly.
