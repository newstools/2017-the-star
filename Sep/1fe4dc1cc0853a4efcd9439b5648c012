NASA MPs will meet this week to iron out differences that have emerged over House leadership positions.According to sources, NASA principals Raila Odinga, Kalonzo Musyoka and Moses Wetang&acirc;&#128;&#153;ula will meet members of the National Assembly and the Senate to discuss how to share out key positions.This is causing jitters in the opposition over slots for the Minority party in both Houses. The seats that need to be filled are the deputy Minority leader positions, the Whips and their deputies.&acirc;&#128;&#156;We will seat with our leaders to resolve the stalemate. The positions must be filled by next week when the Houses begins proper sittings,&acirc;&#128;&#157; an ODM MP told the Star yesterday at Parliament BuildingsCoast MPs are set to hold a meeting tomorrow to come up with their list.Suna East MP Junet Mohamed is said to be keen on the deputy Minority whip, Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa (Ford Kenya) was proposed for the seat.Some MPs are uncomfortable with Lugari MP Ayub Savula being given the deputy Minority leader. They want the position to go to Wiper, which is the second largest party in the five-member NASA.Wiper feels that after it lost the Minority leader position to John Mbadi (Suba South) of ODM, Kalonzo Musyoka&acirc;&#128;&#153;s party should get the deputy Minority leader&acirc;&#128;&#153;s seat as a consolation.Raila is said to have earmarked Mishi Mboko as PSC commissioner to replace Homa Bay woman representative Gladys Wanga. NASA has three slots in the PSC while Jubilee, the majority party, has four commissioners. ANC and Wiper will get one slot each.However, NASA CEO Norman Magaya yesterday dismissed a list that indicates Mbadi as the Minority leader. He said a retreat will be organised to share out the positions equally among all NASA-affiliate parties.A proposed line-up that excluded MPs from Coast that leaked on Monday caused an uproar.Led by Msambweni MP Suleiman Dori and his Kisauni counterpart Ali Mbogo, the legislators said they will not agree to be marginalised.Yesterday, fresh claims of betrayal by some Coast MPs emerged, threatening to rock the alliance.Two MPs, Aisha Jumwa (Malindi) and Mboko (Likoni) are accused of betraying their colleagues, who addressed a press conference at Parliament Buildings on Monday.&acirc;&#128;&#156;We were heading for the press conference, but they suddenly disappeared,&acirc;&#128;&#157; Mbogo told the Star yesterday on the phone.There is a general feeling that Jumwa and Mboko might have been promised seats in the influential PSC.The Coast MPs had already settled on Jumwa for the post, but after Monday&acirc;&#128;&#153;s disappearing act, they changed their minds.&acirc;&#128;&#156;We will look for other people from the Coast to be appointed,&acirc;&#128;&#157; said an MP from Kilifi, who did not want to be named.Mboko and Jumwa, however, denied betraying their colleagues.They said they were not aware of the press conference until much later.&acirc;&#128;&#156;We only saw on TV the Coast MPs addressing the press conference. We were not with them. Why didn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t they inform us?&acirc;&#128;&#157; said Jumwa on the phone.The Malindi MP, however, said she does not mind missing out on the PSC position as long as it is given to another Coast MP.&acirc;&#128;&#156;If a Coast MP gets it, then I have no problem. I will be happy with that,&acirc;&#128;&#157; she said.Mboko said she has not been promised any post.&acirc;&#128;&#156;I did not disappear. When they were holding their press conference, I was somewhere else. Those are only stories,&acirc;&#128;&#157; Mboko told the Star on the phone.She said there has not been a Coast Parliamentary Group meeting to discuss any position.An MP from Taita Taveta thinks the two can&acirc;&#128;&#153;t be trusted anymore. &acirc;&#128;&#156;We are now jittery about them,&acirc;&#128;&#157; said the MP.
