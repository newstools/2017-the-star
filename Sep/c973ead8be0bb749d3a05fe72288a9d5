Former
Tanzanian beauty queen Wema Sepetu is one lass we can say has dated a lot of
celebrities. Her most recent boyfriend was big brother-winner-cum comedian
Idris Sultan. The
two dated for months and later broke up, citing irreconcilable differences.
Idris has now come out to say he was the one who dumped Sepetu, but it was not
an easy decision. He
says Sepetu broke his heart many times and he decided to walk out of the relationship,
and it took him six months to get her off his mind. “Kuna
utoto mwingi sana ulifanyika in public… Going into love is very easy but
kuondoka is hard,” he told Dizzim Online. He
went on to tell the Tanzanian-based site that he got involved with more than 30
women to get Sepetu out of his system. “When
I was trying to get her out of my mind, I slept with or dated more than 30
women. Honestly. So I grew up!” It
seems everyone who has dated this Tanzanian lass finds it hard to get her out
of his mind. Diamond, who also dated Sepetu, said that it took him long for him
to get over her. He said when he was with Zari, he still had a soft spot for
the beauty queen. So,
why is this so? "She is a very beautiful-hearted person.” Idris said. Wema
also dated the late bongo star Steven Kanumba, singer Ommy Dimpoz, Idris
Sultan, Diamond Platnumz, and a sex tape of herself and a Tanzanian model
recently leaked.
