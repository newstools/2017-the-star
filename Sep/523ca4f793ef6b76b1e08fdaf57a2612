The government has withdrawn the security detail of NASA leader Raila Odinga and his running mate Kalonzo Musyoka. Raila Spokesman Dennis Onyango told the Star on Tuesday that the bodyguards of the two were recalled to the GSU camp on Monday evening. ODM Director of communication Philip Etale also echoed Onyango sentiments claiming the officers have been deployed to North Eastern Kenya. "Withdrawing Raila and Kalonzo security detail is ill-advised, backward, outdated and archaic to say the least," he said via Twitter. But Police spokesman Charles Owino told the Star that they are scaling down the security details of all VIPs. "This is not withdrawal, its scaling down of officers to deal with the shortage of about 5000 who have retired," Owino said. The withdrawal comes hours before the opposition's planned protests against IEBC officials. Tens of anti-riot officers have been stationed at various police stations waiting for action. They have been ordered to disperse today’s protester's if they become “violent”.

Chiloba is at the centre of the protracted standoff and the NASA coalition has called for his sacking. The Supreme Court on September 1 nullified President Uhuru Kenyatta's victory, indicting the IEBC and citing enormous irregularities and illegalities. It did identify specific people. NASA pledges it to boycott the rerun if it's supervised by Chiloba and 'indicted' secretariat staff. Read: Chiloba: I’m busy with rerun, no plan to quit
