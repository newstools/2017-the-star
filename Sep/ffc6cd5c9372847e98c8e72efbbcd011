Embattled IEBC CEO Ezra Chiloba has protested, saying he has been singled out and blamed for the irregularites during the August 8 poll.He, however, said he is not about to quit.Chiloba said the blame should be shouldered by the entire electoral agency.He said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;The Constitution does not say the CEO of the commission runs the election. It says the commission established by the Constitution runs the election.&acirc;&#128;&#157; Chiloba spoke during an interview on NTV on Wednesday night.This was the clearest signal yet that Chiloba is unwilling to go down alone, especially after IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati blasted him in a 12-point memo over the irregularities. Chebukati wrote an explosive memo to Chiloba.The memo, which Chiloba said he has adequately responded to, appeared to heap all the blame on his office, including the failed satellite phones acquired at more than Sh800 million.&acirc;&#128;&#156;Does it mean that if the High Court makes a decision which is overturned by the Court of Appeal the judge who made the decision must resign?&acirc;&#128;&#157; Chiloba asked.In its decision, the Supreme Court said the IEBC committed illegalities and irregularities in the August 8 polls.Opposition chiefs, led by Raila Odinga, have been piling pressure on Chiloba and 10 other senior officials to resign.Just a day after threatening that there would be no election if its demands are not met, NASA yesterday skipped a critical meeting with IEBC commissioners deepening uncertainty about repeat poll preparations.During the interview, Chiloba said elections are a complex process that cannot lie on the shoulders of one man.&acirc;&#128;&#156;I am in charge of the secretariat, the commission is in charge of policyand all these human resources support each other to ensure the commission performs its duty,&acirc;&#128;&#157; Chiloba said, adding the Supreme Court has not pinpointed who should be held responsible for the illegalities.&acirc;&#128;&#156;You decide to narrow down on specific individuals forgetting that this is a complex system where each and every person plays a critical role.&acirc;&#128;&#157;Despite the Supreme Court ruling, Chiloba said he is convinced the polls were free and fair.He described the account of Chebukati used to make 9,934 transactions in the server as &acirc;&#128;&#156;a clerical account&acirc;&#128;&#157;.&acirc;&#128;&#156;They were legitimate transactions and they did not in any way affect the credibility of the the process based on the expert advice that we have already received,&acirc;&#128;&#157; Chiloba said.
