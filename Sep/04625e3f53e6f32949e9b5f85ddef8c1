The Wajir county assembly on Tuesday unanimously approved a Sh4.6 billion budget to allow the county government tackle biting drought in the region. The money is part of the county's budget for the 2017/2018 financial year and was approved in a record 30 minutes. Governor Mohamed Abdi had last week appealed to MCAs to urgently consider the budget. He said his administration urgently needed funds to tackle the on-going drought in the area. Many people are starving while livestock have died in Wajir in recent days. Speaker Ibrahim Ahmed convened the Tuesday special meeting which approved the budget. He told the MCAs that the drought situation was worsening and that it was prudent for them to approve the budget and allow the county government respond to the needs of those suffering. All the county's 48 elected MCAs and their nominated colleagues attended the sitting. They agreed the situation required urgent attention. "The MCAs raised some issues with the budget but eventually agreed to pass it," Ahmed said. The county government had been unable to access county funds because the budget had not been passed. This, Ahmed said, had paralysed service delivery. The motion had been fronted by Majority leader Mohamud Gabane. The approved budget is 50 percent of the county's total and the MCAs said it should cater for the county's needs over the next six months. Abdi thanked the MCAs for passing the supplementary budget saying the county was staring at a crisis as the drought continues to threaten livelihoods. "This will allow the county government speed up water tracking activities and provision of emergency services," said Abdi. The money will also be used to offset salary arrears owed to county workers. The employees have not been paid their July and August salaries.
