Kabras head Coach Charles Cardovillis is happy with his team&rsquo;s defence despite finishing fifth in the Driftwood Sevens.He said he had taken a lot of positives from the event and hopes to make amends in this weekend&rsquo;s Kabeberi Sevens circuit at the RFUEA grounds.&ldquo;Driftwoods did not go according to our plan because we had wanted to win the tournament. However, I took a lot of positives from the event especially our defence.&rdquo; Kabras were good in defence but looked hesitant in offensive hence conceding three tries from the tournament&ldquo;We were really good, we only conceded three tries in the whole tournament and I believe we can only get better. I am very happy with the boys but we will need to improve on a few small things,&rdquo; said Cardovillis.The last year&rsquo;s Kabeberi Plate winners are in Pool &lsquo;D&rsquo; alongside Mean Machine, Strathmore Leos and Division II champions Makueni RFC. &ldquo;All teams are looking to beef up especially with the players coming from the national team. It&rsquo;s definitely going to be a very interesting weekend and it will give us an indication of where the whole series is going,&rdquo; added Cardovillis. Top Fry Nakuru coach Mitch Ochola wants his players to tackle a game at a time during the Kabeberi Sevens. Top Fry finished runners up in Driftwood Sevens after falling 17-7 to Homeboyz.
