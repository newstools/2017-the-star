Passing the Appropriations Bill to enable Governor Mike Sonko withdraw cash from the county's account will be the new Nairobi assembly's first assignment when it officially begins business.The MCAs' other immediate task will be to amend the Finance Act to reduce licence fees in line with the governor's vision and mission.The governor is expected to address the house in two weeks and officially open its proceedings. The MCAs were sworn in last Wednesday and elected former nominated Senator Beatrice Elachi speaker.Sonko cannot currently withdraw any money for projects as the previous assembly unlawfully passed the Appropriation Bill, which was declared null and void.The county Treasury published the Appropriation Bill, authorising expenditure, before MCAs passed the 2017-18 Sh35.9 billion budget estimates, thus violating the Public Finance Management Act, which guides the process.Section 129 ( 7 ) of the Act reads, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Upon approval of the budget estimates by the county assembly, the CEC member for Finance shall prepare and submit a County Appropriation Bill to the assembly of approved estimates.&acirc;&#128;&#157;To stop the county from grounding, the former assembly instead passed a vote-on-account, which only allows the governor to withdraw only up to half of the amount budgeted for during the year. The money can only be used on recurrent expenditure.&acirc;&#128;&#156;Appropriation Bill is a priority. We want the governor to have money to do development for the residents,&acirc;&#128;&#157; majority leader Abdi Guyo said.During campaigns, Sonko promised to reduce daily parking fees from Sh300 to Sh140. He also pledged to scrap licence fees for micro and small business traders.City residents, especially the business community, have complained of high levies imposed by the previous administration.&acirc;&#128;&#156;We want to help the governor reduce the rates paid by residents. They are too high. So our first agenda when we resume will be to amend the Finance laws,&acirc;&#128;&#157; Guyo said.
