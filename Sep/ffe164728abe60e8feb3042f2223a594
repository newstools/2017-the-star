United States International University (USIU) ‘A’ Spartans begin their Kenya Hockey Premier League second leg with a match against Kenyatta University at City Park today. Spartans, who are trailing league leaders Telkom by five points have a chance to reduce the gap to two if they floor their fellow students, who are eighth with 11 points. USIU finished the first leg of the season on good form, winning eight of their 10 encounters, with the others ending in a draw and a loss. KU were not at their best in the first leg where they recorded three wins, two draws and lost five in the ten matches played in the first leg. However, KU are not intimidated by their opponents’ favourite tag but have vowed to do their best to stop the high flying Spartans. “There is a formation we have been trying to adapt and we hope it will work against them. The one-month vacation has affected the players’ fitness but mentally, they are strong and ready to begin the second leg with a win. We will play an offensive game. By attacking they will soak pressure and allow us to score and take the three points home,” said coach KU Moses Kagochi. The match will kick off at 6pm.
