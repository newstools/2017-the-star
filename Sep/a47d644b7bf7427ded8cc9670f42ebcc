The Garissa,Wajir and Manadera county assemblies will officially open tomorrow. The opening was scheduled for last week, but was postponed to allow MCAs and county leaders to meet President Uhuru Kenyataa at State House, Nairobi. Speakers have gazetted tomorrow’s sitting in a special notice, paving way for governors to make their keynote addresses. Jubilee won the majority of seats in the region. It is only in Wajir county where three MPs were elected through NASA affiliate parties. They are ODM’s Ahmed Kolosh (Wajir West) and Ahmed Abdisalan (Wajir North) as well as Wiper’s Rashid Kassim (Wajir East). Jubilee and its affiliate parties also won the majority of MCA seats. The counties will have to conduct a delicate balancing act when it comes to appointing executives to their Cabinet. They will have to factor in gender and clans, all the while ensuring that professionals are hired. In Garissa, Governor Ali Korane enjoys the majority. Thirty-four MCAs are from Jubilee against 14 from NASA. Speaker Ibrahim Abass was also fronted by the Jubilee MCAs. It is the same case in Wajir, where the majority of MCAs are from Jubilee. Speaker Mohamed Gabane, who was fronted by Jubilee, also won. It is, however, a different case in Mandera, where Governor Ali Roba does not have the majority of MCAs from his party. The speaker’s seat also went to EFP’s Aden Khalif  as did the deputy speaker’s seat through Abdi Ali. ELDERS’ PICK LOST Those who were elected on the EFP ticket were the choice of  the powerful Garre Council of Elders. Its candidate for the governor’s seat - Hassan Noor - lost to Roba. He has moved to court to challnge the results. Political analysts say it will be difficult for Roba to control the assembly and pass bills. Khalif yesterday said it will not be in the interest of the people to fight Roba.
