Youths in Kibera and Kawangware are set to enjoy low data costs after Poa! Internet, the low-cost community Internet provider, launched unlimited bundles that start at just Sh10 per hour, drastically cutting the cost of getting online.&ldquo;We believe the move to such cheap unlimited data will transform the way our customers use the internet,&rdquo; said Andy Halsall, Poa!&rsquo;s CEO.The platform has thousands of customers in Kibera and recently launched its services in Kawangware.The launch of its unlimited mini-packages cuts the cost of using apps such as WhatsApp, which use around 44MB data per hour, from a minimum of Sh27.5 using the closest competing service on offer, down to just Sh10.&ldquo;Our aim is that this move to Internet &lsquo;time&rsquo; instead of data counting - right down to the smallest unit of one hour - will put our users onto a completely different plane of communication and Internet use, &ldquo; he added.Unlimited data bundles represent an even greater dividend for customers when using data heavy apps such as YouTube or watching movies. These typically use around 700MB of data an hour and so the cost of watching a two-hour film when counting MB&rsquo;s would usually be around Sh700. Using Poa! Internet time bundles, the cost will be just Sh20.&ldquo;We genuinely believe that in our mission to give every Kenyan Internet access, moving to ultra-low cost unlimited bundles is a game changer,&rdquo; said Halsall.Poa! now plans a rapid expansion in its community internet programme. Poa! then uses the same internet points to offer low cost access to paying users throughout the rest of the community.
