Agonising footage has emerged of the moment a man was clawed in the testicles by a crab that refused to let go.The eye-watering video was filmed as the poor victim was taking a dip in a pool, believed to be in Thailand.He was in the water for just a few seconds before the hostile crustacean launched its vicious attack.He howls a blood-curdling scream as his friends help him out of the water.His rescuers attempt to free him from the crab's grip but appear to have a hard time doing so as the creature refuses to let go.In the end the men pull the grab so hard that its claw comes off leaving it still attached to the man's privates.
