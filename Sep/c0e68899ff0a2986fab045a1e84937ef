The 2017 Sportpesa Premier League title race is all but over after league leaders Gor Mahia defeated one of their closest challengers Sofapaka 2-1 to open up an eight-point gap with under seven matches left to play. Dylan Kerr’s charges have 48 points from 23 matches. George Odhiambo who is enjoying a renaissance of sorts this year put K’Ogalo ahead in Kisumu after just 10 minutes to hand Gor a perfect start to what many deemed an important fixture in determining the direction of the tittle come November. The onus was now on Sofapaka to go for broke. This left them at the mercy of counter-attacks by the deadly Gor attack. The league leaders could have been out of sight by halftime but last ditch defending by Humphrey Okoti and Rogers Aloro coupled  with some top draw goalkeeping by Matthew Kigonya kept Batoto Ba Mungu in the contest. Sam Ssimbwa’s men even finished the half with a flourish. Record signing Umar kasumba planted a superb header beyond the reach of Boniface Oluoch to restore parity going into halftime. Sensing that the tide had swung in their way, Ssimbwa reacted after the break bringing on Ezekiel Okare and Hilary Echesa for Morven Otinya and Bernard Mang’oli. It was, however, to be the veteran Echesa who has won many points for Sofapaka who would concede a penalty after a rash tackle on Francis Kahata. Rwandan hot-shot Jacques Tuyisenge, however, failed from six yards. He would be grateful to his compatriot Meddie Kagere 10 minutes later as the latter bailed him out by heading K’Ogalo back into the lead in the 67th minute. Gor had further chances to widen their lead the best of which fell to Odhiambo who  missed from a tight angle with the goal gaping. It mattered little, however, as they held on for the three points that will go a long way in sealing their 16th national championship.
