Do you own a car or operate a matatu in Nairobi? And do you pay for parking? If you do not, then you better start paying now.JamboPay, the company that provides online parking fee payment services for the county government, is set to introduce aerial drone cameras to monitor vehicles whose owners do not pay the fees.The company has written to the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority, seeking permission to import the cameras to help enforce the revenue collection.&ldquo;We have developed an aerial imagery compliance data-gathering module that will require us to deploy a drone to collect parking compliance data,&rdquo; reads a letter by JamboPay chief executive Danson Muchemi.The letter, dated August 28, is addressed to KCAA director general Gilbert Kibe and copied to Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko.Drones to capture defaultersMuchemi said the drones will fly across the parking areas in the city twice a day, capturing and relaying data to their servers.The information will then be relayed to the county parking department for appropriate enforcement measures, which include clamping of vehicles whose owners have defaulted.&ldquo;We hereby request your approval of our importation and operation of two commercial drones,&rdquo; reads the letter.KCAA developed regulations for the importation and use of the drones (Aerial Unmanned Vehicles) last year.In the regulations, KCAA categorised drone use under sports, recreation and commercial activities.Lax enforcement has been partly blamed for the revenue losses in the parking department.No drones near aviation hubsThe regulator capped the maximum height the drones can fly at 400 feet above the ground, with those seeking higher operating heights required to seek approvals.The rules also ban the flying of the drones over security installations, close to aviation hubs or airports and at night.Failure to adhere to the rules will attract a fine of Sh500,000 or a jail term of not more than three months.Two weeks ago, Muchemi said the county loses Sh600,000 million a day, translating into about Sh18 million per month, in parking revenue through weak enforcement.He said that at least 2,000 vehicle owners do not pay parking fees each day via eJijiPay &mdash; the established online system. This is despite the parking department and all enforcement officers getting instant reports from the system with all the information on defaulters.Last week, Sonko said cash payments will no longer be allowed at City Hall and all revenue streams will be automated.&ldquo;Going forward, we have decided that no cash will be accepted at City Hall. Pay your fees via eJijiPay either by dialing *217# on your phone or online via https://epayments.nairobi.go.ke or via the eJijiPay apps available on Playstore,&rdquo; he said in a statement.
