Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya (pictured) has submitted a new list of county executive committee members for vetting and approval by the county assembly. Three former CEC members are not among those listed for the positions. They are Athman Chiguzo  (Health), Patrick Mtsami (Community Development) and Ali Mafimbo (Environment). Other names have been proposed in their place. It’s not clear whether they applied for the positions. Some MCAs previously said they would not allow the three to serve “if nominated because they failed to deliver”. Francis Gwama has been nominated for the Health Services, Ramadhan Bungale for Social Services and Talent Management, which was previously under Community Development. Saumu Mahaya will head the Environment department if approved. Hassan Mwakulonda has been nominated for Public Service and Administration, which was previously under the Deputy Governor’s office, while Sheha Wanyera has been proposed for Water Services. Safina Kwekwe will head Tourism and Enterprise Development, which was headed by current Mandara South MP Adan Sheik. Kwekwe served as Trade executive in the first county government. Those who will retain their positions if approved are Bakari Sebe (Finance and Economic Planning), Mangale Munga (Education), Hemed Mwabudzo (Roads and Public Works) and Joanne Nyamasyo (Agriculture). Kwale county speaker Sammy Ruwa on Tuesday confirmed receiving the list of the 10 nominees. He said the assembly will vet them within 10 days so those successful can take the oath of office as soon as possible.
