Police in Lugari, Kakamega county, have launched a manhunt for thugs who butchered a night guard at Lavonga Bar in Mwamba on the Eldoret–Webuye highway. The guard was found dead on Sunday morning by staff reporting for duty. His neck was almost severed. Staffer Ruth Mbaya said they found all the doors wide open when they came in at 9am. She said they were shocked to find the guard in his seat with his head almost coming off his body. “It’s very painful to see this. We came in the morning to do stock checking and found one of us killed in a bizarre manner ... We want police to do something urgently,” Mbaya said. Bar owner Noah Ndunde told journalists he was informed about the killing and theft and rushed to the bar. “I called the police, who came and we found the electronics and some stock missing. We are yet to ascertain the total cost of what has been stolen.” He said the guard had worked for him for a long time and was a very responsible and diligent worker. Ndunde called for a speedy probe. Residents have complained of increased crime in the past two months and blamed it on police laxity. They have asked police to increase patrols at night and transfer officers who have overstayed in the area and are now liaising with thugs. Police are investigating.
