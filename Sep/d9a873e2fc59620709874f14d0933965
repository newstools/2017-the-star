Former Alliance Boys’ High School principal David Kariuki has been appointed an executive member in Embu.  Kariuki has been appointed by Governor Martin Wambora as Trade, Tourism and Industrialisation executive. He is among 10 executive appointees, whose names have been forwarded to the county assembly for vetting.  He resigned early this year, following reports of violent bullying among students. In February, there were reports of maltreatment of form one students. The acts were said to have been carried out by prefects and senior students and the school management was accused of failing to take action.  On Tuesday, Embu speaker Josiah Thiriku told the assembly he had received the list of the appointees.  The others who have been appointed include Justa Wawira to serve in Public Service and Administration docket.  John Njagi has been retained in the Finance  department.
