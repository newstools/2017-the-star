Raila Odinga yesterday said a well-run election rerun must take priority, even if it means delaying school exams."If elections are postponed for two weeks, the children will not die," the NASA presidential candidate said as he rejected the October 17 date gazetted by the IEBC.The electoral agency also gazetted President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila as the only two candidates.Raila threatened a boycott.&ldquo;There will be no elections on 17 October until the conditions we have spelt out are met,&rdquo; the former Prime Minister told a news conference at Wilson Airport before flying to Kisii for rallies.Raila and NASA want the rerun on October 24 or 31, saying there are many conditions that must be met first.On Monday, the IEBC announced the date, a day after Education CS Fred Matiang'i urged the election not be pushed beyond October 17.He said a delayed election would be disruptive and have far-reaching ramifications for the entire annual education calendar.The KCPE exam runs from October 31 to November 2. The KCSE exam runs from November 6 to 29.NASA yesterday said it the IEBC and Matiang'i were colluding and the electoral body was taking government instructions.Meantime, IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati will directly supervise a new head of ICT as he appoints a fresh "project team" to handle the rerun.He has left out CEO Ezra Chiloba and ICT director James Muhati &mdash; people Raila wants out.The team will be in office for three months.The head of ICT team will b Albert Gogo, while Chiloba's role as the main coordinator has been taken by Marjan Hussein, deputy CEO.Others in the team are Sidney Namulungu to head operations, Nancy Kariuki (logistics), Bernard Misati as head of training and Silas Rotich as head of the national tally centre.The Opposition issued a fresh list of demands and accused the IEBC of fixing the rerun date without consulting the opposition.Raila said NASA would boycott unless it receives "legal and constitutional&rdquo; guarantees.President Uhuru Kenyatta responded by saying the IEBC was responsible for setting poll dates and there was no legal requirement to consult Raila. "I was neither consulted. Kenya doesn&rsquo;t belong to one man,&rdquo; he said in a statement.He accused Raila of wanting a caretaker government in which he would seize power by the back door."I don't mkate nusu, I want the boflo (whole loaf)," Raila said.NASA wants removal of six electoral agency officials it considers to be partisan and working with Jubilee. He wants investigation with a view to prosecution.NASA also demands an audit of the whole electoral system, including KIEMS, servers and infrastructure."Hatuwezi rudi nyuma...fisi hawezi chunga mbuzi. Wale jamaa hawawezi linda kura zetu.. tukiwapa kura wataiba (We cannot move backwards...a hyena cannot guard sheep. Those people cannot guard our votes...if we allow them they will steal)," Raila said.&ldquo;You cannot do a mistake twice and expect to get different results,&rdquo; Odinga told reporters. &ldquo;A number of commission officials should be sent home, some of them should be investigated for the heinous crimes they committed.&rdquo;As Raila and Uhuru hit the campaign trail again, the IEBC was busy preparing for the election. It was drawing up calendar and preparing a budget.CEO Ezra Chiloba is to write to the Treasury today, after commissioners approve the budget, to enable procurement of election materials.The commission has told all officers to bring all KIEMS kits to Nairobi so they can be loaded with fresh information. They were still at the 290 constituencies after the August 8 General Election.Officials from Safran Morpho, the French company that supplied kits, were to arrive in Nairobi yesterday to start preparations.Some 74 petitions challenging the election have been filed in courts countrywide.Six governors and 15 MPs are among those who risk losing their positions if the court finds any irregularities. If not, their jobs are safe.According to a judiciary statement, petitions are challenging governor elections in Embu, Garissa, Tana River, Kirinyaga, Mandera and Taita Taveta counties.The 13 MPs facing challenges are from Kabuchai, Teso North, Teso South, Wajir West, Wajir West, Lamu West, Magarini, Gatundu North, Embakasi, Garissa, Mandera East, Imenti North and Ugenya, among others.Two senators from Kirinyaga and Wajir will defend their jobs in court.Also challenged are elections of 45 MCAs.Speaking in Ongata Rongai in Kajiado yesterday, Uhuru, accused Raila of plotting to demand a caretaker government in which the Opposition would get power."I have been annoyed because the Presidency was stolen from me. Anyone can get annoyed when their victory is stolen from them. If he (Raila) was honest, he would have asked that we have a recount of the votes but he did not."If he wants another election, why is he disputing the date announced by IEBC?. Raila's plan is to derail the election so that they can get into government through the back door. We must ensure that we respect democracy," the President said.Last Friday the Supreme Court ordered a rerun be held within 60 days, saying Kenyatta&rsquo;s victory by 1.4 million votes was undermined by irregularities in the process.NASA challenged Kenyatta's win, arguing the results had been tampered with during tallying and transmission.The court found that, among other things, the IEBC had committed "illegalities" in the transmission of results. But it has not released its detailed ruling.Raila faulted the IEBC for saying the rerun will be just between him and Uhuru, saying there were eight candidates in August and they should be included."The entire election was cancelled by the Supreme Court," he said. "That means you do a repeat of the presidential elections afresh."NASA wants the IEBC to gazette returning officers not among Constituency Election Coordinators, in consultations with parties and candidates.The opposition also wants IEBC to agree with them on the framework for printing of ballot papers and results declaration forms and monitoring.Jubilee leaders termed NASA's conditions as tactics of a losing candidate.Through Senate Majority Leader Kipchumba Murkomen, Jubilee leaders said it is not a must for NASA to participate in the election.
