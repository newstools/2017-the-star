The upcoming fresh election order by the Supreme Court will be between Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila Odinga if a ruling made in 2013 is followed.However, the standing of Ekuru Aukot and Wainaina is still in question after they were enjoined in the case at the Supreme Court but were not the petitioners.Since the law is unclear on the conduct of a fresh election, Attorney General, acting at an Amicus Curiae in 2013, asked the Supreme Court to pronounce itself on the matter.The judges made two determinations on the issue - one on where a candidate is a petitioner and one where the case is brought by someone who was not a candidate.In the case where a petition is brought by one of the candidates like Raila did, the Supreme Court said that the fresh election would be between the petitioner and the president-elect whose election was nullified."If the petitioner was only one of the candidates, and who had taken the second position in vote-tally to the President-elect, then the &ldquo;fresh election&rdquo; will, in law, be confined to the petitioner and the President-elect. And all the remaining candidates who did not contest the election of the President-elect, will be assumed to have either conceded defeat or acquiesced in the results as declared by IEBC; and such candidates may not participate in the &ldquo;fresh election," the Supreme Court ruled.In the second instance, the court said that the fresh election would be between all the candidates who had participated in the annulled election.The judges said that if they had invalidated the 2013 election, "only the 1st Petitioner (Raila) would participate as a contestant in the &ldquo;fresh election&rdquo; against the President-elect. And the candidate who receives the most votes in the fresh election would be declared elected as President."They also added that if a petition challenging the President-elect is filed by more than one candidate who had participated in the original election and the petition succeeded, the only candidates in the fresh election would be the petitioners as well as the declared President-elect whose election had been annulled."All the remaining candidates who did not contest the election of the President-elect will be assumed to have either conceded defeat or acquiesced in the results as declared by IEBC; and such candidates may not participate in the &ldquo;fresh election&rdquo;," the Supreme Court judges said.Read: Raila wins as Supreme Court nullifies Uhuru re-electionAlso read: Raila will beat Uhuru in repeat election, Dida says vows to back NASA
