 Kenya is in turmoil because the Supreme Court took a very strict line on the faulty transmission of results and annulled the August 8 election of President Uhuru Kenyatta. It is therefore incumbent on both presidential candidates in the October 17 race to make certain they carefully follow the rules so that the next election result cannot be successfully appealed. Section 14(1) of the Election Offences Act prohibits anyone from using public resources to campaign for a political party or candidate. Yet in the last week President Kenyatta has met delegations of Kamba, Kisii and Bukhusu leaders at State House and publicly urged them to support Jubilee. The Supreme Court exonerated Uhuru from individual wrongdoing when it annulled the August election. But will it take the same line in October if Raila loses and Nasa petitions on the grounds that Uhuru used state resources to campaign? Jubilee is playing with fire. It would be sensible going forward if they made certain that President Kenyatta only campaigned in neutral public venues.
