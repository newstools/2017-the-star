The people of Nyandarua spoke loudly when they overwhelmingly elected me as the second governor of Nyandarua.My focus is on two critical factors that will rede&#64257;ne this century: Food and water security, to change our status from the least-developed and poorest county per capita in the former Central Province.I reiterate my determination and commitment to fully operationalise my manifesto, which is underpinned on six key pillars: Good governance (peace, security, democracy and rule of law); social sector development (education, health, culture, rights, social dimension and services); infrastructure development (water, irrigation, sewerage, energy, transport and communication, ICT, sports, tourism, and environment); financial and trade services and entrepreneurship development; agriculture development, environmental conservation; and investments and industrialisation.In addition, we must audit the manifestos of all elected leaders and aspirants who didn&rsquo;t win as we develop our new County Integrated Development Plan and Medium Term Plan for the period 2017 -22.I will ensure that henceforth, Nyandarua people are fully engaged in matters that affect their destiny in tandem with the Constitution.These will be backed with robust monitoring and evaluation and ICT systems that capture and update us all on county government and the county assembly performance in real-time.Scheduled visits will be made to wards to avoid incidents of ghost projects, ghost workers and useless programmes add no value to the lives of our people.I met many people during my meet-the-people endeavours who complained they had never seen or heard from those they elected and that their vehicles had tinted dark windows, with personal assistants who had road-blocked and alienated people.This possibly accounts for the attrition of nearly 90 per cent elected leaders who were not reelected &ndash; a very high casualty and not good for a young democracy's succession management.This is a warning to us that if we repeat this mistake, we will have nobody to blame.We will institutionalise a results-based public service where every public servant in all ranks is placed on a performance contract, and log-in to account for each hour and days worked.We will rationalise, attract, retain, motivate and develop skilled staff for our county public service.A capacity audit will be undertaken, preceded by a staff audit, payroll cleanse, and head count to guide re-deployment and recruitment that is based on needs.My administration will be pragmatic, working through leadership caucuses of elected leaders, ward committees, professionals, interest groups and various subject matter experts on each pillar in my manifesto.We cannot grow and develop in isolation.Therefore, my administration commits to work closely with other counties and the national government for the bene&#64257;t of all Kenyans.I will also be active at the Council of Governors' fora and other internal and external meetings to promote our interests.Resources received from the national government are not adequate while the scope of raising revenues internally is limited by the Constitution and the law.My administration commits to prudent management of public funds. Corruption, misappropriation and wastage of public resources will not be tolerated.We commit to reducing the rate of growth of our recurrent expenditure and progressively increasing funding for a balanced, debt-free development budget.Due to limited &#64257;nancial resources, rollout of flagship projects in each subcounty as pronounced in my manifesto will be on a gradual basis rather than in one big bang.In the immediate, we will work for the establishment of a university in Nyandarua, starting off with the main campus here in Kapten, Ol Kalou, followed by satellite campuses in Kipipiri, Ndaragwa, Kinangop and Ol&rsquo;Jororok.Moreover, a key initiative of my administration in the short-term will be to organise an investors&rsquo; conference involving local and international players, during which we will showcase opportunities in our county.Legislatively, my government will develop and implement a public relations and media strategy and related laws to reposition Nyandarua, beginning with boosting its electronic and print media capacity.I will, in a few days, be appointing a change team to develop a 100-days Rapid Results Initiative 10 days after constituting my Cabinet to fast-track development dividends from the national government; institutionalise a comprehensive reform strategy to fast-track quick wins in the manifesto; and form an Intergovernmental committee to address Nyandarua as a marginalised county.This is an abridged version of the writer&rsquo;s inaugural address and manifesto, both of which are fully available at www.nyandarua.go.ke.[email&#160;protected]
