This is confirmation is that President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s victory on August 8 was not genuine. The President has poured out his heart in a most honest way.He does not know how to approach this election. He approached the last election when he connived with the IEBC CEO and those tricks have been unearthed. The IEBC is in a shambles and he cannot configure it to benefit him in a repeat election through stealing.I want to commend the President for being honest, that he cannot win this repeat election. The only thing he is waiting for now is Raila to win and be impeached &ndash; which is also next to impossible.Impeaching will not work because we are going to re-organise the National Assembly. So far, the petitions lodged with the courts will go through and they won&rsquo;t have the numbers. In fact, 100 per cent of the cases will go through.Immediately Raila wins the election, a lot of MPs elected on Jubilee from Western, Coast and the Eastern Meru region will shift their loyalty to him, because every Kenyan is committed to transformation.The pressure from the electorate will automatically put their MPs to support the new government of Raila Odinga.The impeachment process, if you look at it the way it has been done in other jurisdictions, is normally a people- driven initiative.Uhuru must understand that impeachment is a people- driven initiative, Kenyans will not be mad again after three months to vote for another referendum to impeach Raila.The grounds of impeaching an elected President as captured in Article 145 are also higher and no one can just wake up and impeach a democratically elected president.The law requires that an elected president can only be impeached on the grounds of violation of the Constitution, when the president commits a crime under the national or international law and if there is gross misconduct on the part of the president. I do not think any of those grounds can support those mischievous acts that Jubilee leaders, including the President, are speaking about.Even the numbers they are wielding, they cannot get the two-thirds needed to impeach a sitting President.We are not worried as NASA about the impeachment; in fact, the President and his party are just pouring out themselves that they were in fact declared winner irregularly and illegally.
