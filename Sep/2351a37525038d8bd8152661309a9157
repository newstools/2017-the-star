Nyandarua youth have said that they will teach MP Babu Owino a lesson and make him "grow up''  for insulting President Uhuru Kenyatta. Speaking at Ol Kalou town on Monday, the Vijana Tuhakikishe lobby group said they are ready to go for Owino and teach him manners. "To Babu Owino, we wish to assure you that we shall deal with you judiciary and extra-judiciary but within the continuum of law," the young led by lawyer Wachira Waiganjo said. During a rally in Kawangware's Congo area on Sunday, the Embakasi East legislator tore into someone he referred to as mtoto wa mbwa - a puppy. Babu likened this person to long-term African leaders who were eventually removed from power. Wachira asked NCIC boss Francis Kaparo, police chief Joseph Boinet and DPP Keriako Tobiko to take stern and immediate action against the legislator failure to which they will come for him.

Emma Kibiro said Nyandarua youth are strongly behind the President and shall not allow Owino to continue insulting him. She said Owino must also apologize to Mama Ngina Kenyatta because his utterances insinuating that the president is a "puppy" is an insult to her. "What he said is disrespect to that woman and we know she is a woman of honour," she said. The Nyandarua assembly deputy majority leader, Ken Mukira, described Owino as "immature, a juvenile who need to be taught how to respect the elders". The first-time legislator was arrested by DCI officers on Monday. He spent the night at Pangani police station and will be charged this morning at the Milimani law courts.
