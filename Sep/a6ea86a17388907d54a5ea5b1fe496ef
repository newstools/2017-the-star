Siaya Senator James Orengo has lifted the lid on the Opposition's 'no elections' call. Speaking at a rally in Siaya at the weekend, Orengo hinted that NASA may use its elected Governors to stop any election from taking place in their areas. The Senator who successfully led NASA's legal team to challenge President Uhuru Kenyatta's re-election clarified that the Opposition will not boycott polls but will block IEBC from conducting polls in NASA controlled counties. Currently NASA has 18 counties, while Jubilee has the majority of 27. Two counties elected independent candidates. NASA has been pushing for the restructuring of the electoral body before it is allowed to oversee next month's polls. "You know when we tell them there will be no elections they think we will boycott, we mean there will be no elections in this country. "If [Mombasa Governor Hassan] Joho, [Siaya Governor Cornel] Rasanga, [Turkana Governor Josephat] Nanok say no, can we have elections in those counties?" Orengo asked in Dholuo. According to the alleged Opposition script, Orengo and other NASA leaders will also ensure no election is held in Nairobi county, which is currently headed by Jubilee's Mike Sonko. Earlier on Sunday, NASA principals Raila Odinga, Kalonzo Musyoka and Musalia Mudavadi launched countrywide campaigns to block any election under the current IEBC claiming it is unfit to deliver free and fair polls. The coalition wants IEBC CEO Ezra Chiloba and nine other officials out before the October 17 repeat election. Read: Raila starts campaign to eject Chiloba, says IEBC and Jubilee are partners in crime
