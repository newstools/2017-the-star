Police in Mandera yesterday repulsed al Shabaab fighters after hours of gun fighting following an attack by the militants. Seven Somali National Army soldiers and 16 Somali nationals were injured during the gun fight. The soldiers were admitted to a Mandera hospital. The terrorists had raided Mandera from Somalia’s border town of Bulla Hawa. They were pursuing Somalia National Army troops who crossed over into Kenya on Sunday. The Somalian soldiers have since camped in Mandera after al Shabaab seized Bulla Hawa and forced them out of the town. Mandera county commissioner Fredrick Shisia said they are closely following the yesterday morning incident. Security officers from both Kenya police and KDF engaged the militants along the border. Heavy gunfire ensued before KDF repulsed the attackers. The incident occurred barely two kilometres from Mandera town. Residents remained indoors as the fighting raged. There have been heavy police presence in Mandera in recent days with Shisia telling The Star that security in the area had been beefed up to deal with an expected spillover from Somalia. “Our forces are closely monitoring the situation. We want to prevent more spillover by the militants to Kenya. So far, we have managed to contain everything,” said Shisia. Most al Shabaab attacks in Mandera town have been planned in Bulla Hawa from where the militants easily cross over through the porous border. Only last month, gunmen suspected to be al Shabaab members destroyed a Safaricom telecommunication mast in Dabacity area in Mandera. No one was injured in the attack. Police said it was carried out by a group of about 20 gunmen. The attackers had overpowered police reservists who were patrolling the area, about seven kilometres from the Somalia border. Also last month, al Shabaab militants hurled grenades on a Chinese hall near the mast. Chinese engineers are currently carrying out an oil exploration mission in Mandera. Non was present during the raid.
