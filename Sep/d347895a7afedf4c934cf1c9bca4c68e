Nyandarua Governor Francis Kimemia has not been quick to fire county officers because he wants to give them a chance to prove themselves. “I don’t think we should be in a hurry to demoralise our ministers and chief officers,” he said. Kimemia spoke on Thursday in Ol Kalou during the opening of the county assembly. He said he is not in the habit of arbitrarily sacking employees and embarassing them, adding that he prefers to deal with people in an honourable way. Nyandarua executives and chief officers, Kimemia said, are professionals who only need a good leader to work with. He said he knows they are hardworking because he interacted with them when he was in the public service. “These officials are not criminals. They are a viable resource and Nyandarua can become the best-performing county without replacing a single executive officer,” Kimemia said. He said he recognises the law requires that the executive and chief officer positions be advertised, and he will do so, but added he is at liberty to retain officials. “Nothing stops me from keeping the entire Cabinet, half of it or none of it. People should not read too much into this,” Kimemia said. He will name his Cabinet in two weeks. Kimemia said officials who are let go should be absorbed by the national government in parastatals “because they qualify”. “I challenge them to apply even for principal secretary positions,” he said. Kimemia said he wants residents to remember him and his officials for teamwork and having good relations with the county assembly, changing the governance structure in Nyandarua and putting in place policies that are people friendly. “This county will remember me for creating value, enriching our people and creating jobs,” he said.
