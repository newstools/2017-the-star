Eight students from Daystar University’s Athi River Campus were at the weekend admitted at the Aga Khan and Nairobi Women’s hospitals with what was suspected to be cholera. But the university in a statement yesterday said no cholera case has been confirmed and they are waiting for the results of samples taken from the patients. Seven students are at Nairobi Women’s Hospital, Rongai, and one at Aga Khan Hospital. The university said of the eight, only five had cholera symptoms in the initial rapid test. The other three are under observation. The statement said another six patients were treated at the university clinic and discharged. University head of corporate affairs Damaris Kimilu yesterday told the Star the first case was reported at 7am on Saturday. “This student had gone home and came back on Friday after visiting her family in Kayole. She was treated at the school’s clinic and later referred to Nairobi Women’s, Ongata Rongai branch,” she said. “We expect the  rest to be discharged by Wednesday [tommorrow].”  The university has set up information desks within the school to create awareness and prevent more infections.
