NASA presidential campaigns chairman Musalia Mudavadi has warned against what he terms a &lsquo;plot&rsquo; by President Uhuru Kenyatta to remove the two-term limit.The Constitution allows a president to serve a maximum of two five-year terms.Mudavadi lashed out at Uhuru, saying such an attempt to amend the Constitution would claw back the democratic gains Kenyans have made since Independence.On Monday, Uhuru said Jubilee would impeach NASA leader Raila Odinga if elected President and that the party&rsquo;s numerical strength in both Houses could even facilitate a Constitutional amendment.Musalia termed &lsquo;unbecoming&rsquo; the President&rsquo;s behaviour.&ldquo;The outrageous remarks by President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday [Monday] betray a streak of authoritarianism that would only happen in Kenya under an imperial presidency,&rdquo; Mudavadi said in a statement.He continued, &ldquo;Only in bygone days of Emperor Jean Baptiste Bokassa of the Central Africa Republic or under the dictatorship of Nguema of Equatorial Guinea would such a display of hubris be seen in the President&rsquo;s daily summon.&rdquo;Mudavadi said Kenyans should be &ldquo;worried a person holding incumbency as caretaker of the presidency and is seeking reconfirmation to the position holds the same office in utter contempt&rdquo;.&ldquo;And he does it wantonly and with extreme prejudice,&rdquo; he said.Mudavadi warned such impunity usually heralds deadly contravention of political and civic rights. He said the arrest of Johnson Muthama should be seen as the beginning of the immense violation of human rights.&ldquo;But it is not the raving of the President that should worry Kenyans. That is part of his persona,&rdquo; Mudavadi said.He said the President has predetermined the outcome of the October 17 repeat presidential election &ldquo;where Raila Odinga will emerge the winner.&rdquo;Mudavadi said Uhuru announced he will plot a coup through Parliament.
