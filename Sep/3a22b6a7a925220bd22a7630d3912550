Jubilee is expected to marshal its MPs to push for amendments to sections of the Election Laws over the annulment of the presidential poll. Parliamentary sittings will resume today. Jubilee, which enjoys a majority in the Senate and the National Assembly, wants to make it mandatory for a petitioner to prove to the Supreme Court that violations of the Constitution or any electoral law alters the presidential outcome, as declared by the IEBC. Senate majority leader Kipchumba Murkomen has said they will make radical changes in the Constitution to guide on how presidential petitions should be determined by the top-most court in future. On Sunday, Murkomen said Jubilee MPs are ready to make necessary amendments into the law to ensure only numbers of votes matter, not the process of transmission of results. The Elgeyo Marakwet Senator said the Election Laws, as currently constituted, curtail Kenyans in electing leaders of their choice. National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale said they are perusing the full Supreme Court ruling to enable them formulate legislations that will assist the IEBC to conduct the fresh presidential election. He said they will assess the errors that occurred during the August 8 General Election. NASA chief executive officer Norman Magaya said there will be no election if Jubilee amends the law. It is still unclear whether NASA parliamentarians will attend the House sittings to object the amendments.
