Four students of Nanyuki High School yesterday were charged in a Nanyuki court with attempted arson. The students aged between 15 and 17, all in form two, are accused of conspiring to set a classroom on fire on the night of September 22. They also faced a second count of setting a desk on fire in a classroom. Lawyer John Muthomi asked the court to grant the four affordable bail is an orphan who relies on well-wishers for upkeep. But prosecutor Lucas Tanui told the court the alleged offence should be treated with seriousness since school buildings would have burnt down if the administration had not taken quick action. Chief magistrate Lucy Mutai released them on Sh200,000 bond and a surety or Sh50,000 bail. She ordered they be detained at Nanyuki police station juvenile cells if their parents fail to raise the bond. The case will be mentioned on October 9, while the hearing will be on November 29. Kenyan schools have been plagued by fires, at least 15 recently, 140 last year.
