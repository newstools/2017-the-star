A Sh8 million hotel belonging to a voter who challenged the reelection of Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya has been razed. The fire broke out days after Mwamlole Mbwana filed a petition in the Mombasa High Court, seeking the nullification of Mvurya’s victory  on grounds of irregularities. The petitioner also accuses Mvurya of misusing public resources for his campaigns. Mwachale Beach Hotel director Mbwana blames politics for the hotel fire in Kwale. “We have been working well, we have never received any threats. The hotel was burnt after I filed a petition. I know it is politics,” he said. Mwamlole said he does not want to point a finger at anyone. Hotel worker Hassan Makoti said the hotel was their source of income. He said over 15 other workers are now jobless. But Deputy Governor Fatuma Achani dismissed the petition, saying it baseless. “I have gone through it with a fine-tooth comb. All  ssues raised and claims made have no evidence,” the lawyer. said
