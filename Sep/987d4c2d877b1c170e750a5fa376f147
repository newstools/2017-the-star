Veterinarians (pictured) have put down six Nyeri dogs that mauled and killed late Governor Nderitu Gachagua’s two-year-old grandson last week. The boy, Wilson Ngatia, was playing in his grandmother’s compound at Ring Road estate near Nyeri town, when the neighbour’s dogs slipped in and mauled him. Yesterday the Rottweiler and German Shepherd dogs were put down. They were fed poisoned meat. Veterinary officer Judy Wangui said they put down humanely. . The boy’s grandmother Margaret Karungaru and assistant county commissioner John Marete were present. Speaking on behalf of the family of the dog owners, Jeremiah Maina said the mauling was an accident. He said delay in putting down the dogs was necessary to make sure the right process was followed. Maina said the move will ensure good relationship with the neighbours and the community. The six dogs were put down after an agreement between the victim’s family and that of the dog owners. The agreement was part of the healing process for the Gachagua family. The dogs entered Gachagua’s compound last week and efforts by Karungaru to save the boy were unsuccessful. She suffered minor injuries when she tried to rescue her grandson. The boy died on the arrival at the Outspan Hospital. The owner of the dogs, Anthony Gathaara, and handler Njuguna Muriithi have been charged with negligence and recklessness. The boy will be buried tomorrow at his grandparent’s home in Cheru, near River bank, Karatina town, Mathira.
