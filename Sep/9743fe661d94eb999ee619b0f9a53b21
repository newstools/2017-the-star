Like many of his supporters, Raila Odinga deservedly celebrated the extremely rare win at the Supreme Court. It is, however, now turning out to have been more of a poisoned chalice than a blessing. As the clock ticks towards October 17, Raila still doesn’t have a clear path to power. The particulars are all stacked against him and you don’t need a trained eye to know it will take nothing short of a miracle to pull this one off. Raila insists that he won the August 8 election, and so if he doesn’t win the repeat poll, it could serve him a fatal blow in politics. With age not on his side and many other things at stake, he simply must win this one. However, probably without knowing he may have triggered invisible barriers that will complicate his bid. There are several identifiable barriers that are working against Raila in the fresh polls. But while they exist, it is clear that he may not be aware of what these could be or how he can go about it. He has instead chosen to focus much of his firepower on personalities and fighting the very same institution that must declare him President. This is seriously hurting his campaign. The answer might in fact have little to do with IEBC CEO Ezra Chiloba or the electoral commission itself: It has everything to do with the people. Let us look at some of the barriers that will prevent Raila from being President.  Voter's Remorse Normally, in run-offs or reruns, the winner of the first round of voting, tends to lose the repeat election. This phenomenon is referred to as Voter’s Remorse. This word is borrowed from the marketing term known as Buyer’s Remorse, which sets in the moment you buy something and you realise it was probably not quite what you wanted. We have all had this feeling nearly every time we purchase anything expensive — from property, cars to clothes. We feel like we should have gone for the other option and, given a second chance, most buyers opt to get something else. Second round voting and reruns have the same effect. It makes the voter feel like they should not have made the choice and when offered a second chance, most first round winners lose the contest. In two out of the three annulled presidential elections in the world, the first time winners lost in the reruns. This is a good statistic for voter’s remorse but can it apply in Kenya? While the repeat poll gave Raila another chance, can he marshal voters’ remorse to turn the tide in his favour?  Victims of Voter Remorse As we all know now, Kenya became only the fourth country in the world to annul a presidential election and order a repeat. In all of the other three, the initial winners lost in the rerun. In the 2016 Austria presidential election, first round winner Nobert Hofer of the Freedom Party of Austria was unable to beat Alexander Van der Bellen, after the Constitutional court annulled his win. In the 2013 Maldives election rerun, incumbent Mohamed Waheed Hassan came fourth; while the previous loser Abdulla Yameen rose from his 30 per cent loss to a 52 per cent win. In Ukraine the annulled presidential vote in 2004 led to challenger Victor Yushchenko beating second round winner Victor Yanukovych in a vote rerun. Hofer, Hassan and Yanukovych were victims of voter remorse in the reruns. Now that the chances of the losing candidates in reruns are better than the first, Raila should instead focus on getting those who had voted for Uhuru or other candidates to rethink their decision, and crossover to his side. But he isn’t doing that! He is busy engaging in unhelpful turf wars and the way things are going, he might just make himself a victim of voter remorse.  Winner's Complacency Another great cause of first-round winners losing in a rerun is ‘winner’s complacency’. Here, they tend to take things easy knowing (or thinking) that their support base is intact and that they will again vote for them in the rerun. Raila Odinga is strongly exhibiting ‘winner’s complacency’, taking things in his stride and making fewer campaign appearances than Uhuru. In fact, in the way he is taking things easy, I am now convinced he had actually won this thing in the first place. But that is where Uhuru will beat him. Instead of hitting the campaign trail, combing the country top to bottom, he is letting Uhuru run roughshod over him, even in his own bases. Uhuru went on the campaign trail the same afternoon the vote was annulled, and is now busy hosting delegations from Raila’s strongholds. He has made several whistle-stop campaign appearances and rallies, galvanising his support base. He has even deployed First Lady Margaret Kenyatta to the campaign trail. She made history addressing a public rally at Uhuru Park and even recently travelled to the Rift Valley, getting women to back her husband. If Raila must fight the IEBC, then he should let his generals do that and leave him out of press conferences to do the dirty work on the ground with his co-principals.  Bandwagon Effect Another thing that is complicating Raila’s quest for power is the ‘winning-side effect’, better known as the ‘bandwagon effect’. In short, humans tend to be attracted to success or want to be associated with it. Soon after the results of the election was announced on August 11, the ‘win’ by Uhuru was etched in the minds of Kenyans and in the days that followed, many had already accepted the result. In fact, lots of Raila’s supporters had already resigned to their fate and were already moving on. But when the unthinkable happened and the Supreme Court called for a re-match, the effect of having won in the first round was apparent in the minds of many and delegations of ‘defectors’ from NASA supporters are still being received on Uhuru’s side. This phenomenon is called the ‘winning-side effect.’ Just take a look at who is going where. All of Uhuru’s vote blocs remain intact while NASA has already lost two co-principals in less than two weeks. From the look of things, Raila isn’t going to this election with his base intact. In the coming poll, there will be few fence sitters (better known as the undecided) have been pulled over by the bandwagon effect. Simply put, Voter Remorse has refused to descend on the candidacy of Uhuru, and the bandwagon effect is badly hurting NASA. With this in mind, Raila is going into this election with much less surety than he had in August. It remains to be seen how badly he wants to lead this nation. If it is as bad as he wants, then he must seek another path to power.  Making Kenya Disappear Spanish politician Jose Maria Gil-Robles once said, “Democracy is for us not an end, but a means to go to the conquest of a new state. When the moment comes, either the Cortes will submit or we shall make it disappear.” The “Cortes” here is the legislative assembly of Spain. For Raila, it seems that if the Kenyan people won’t submit to him, then he must make the Kenyan nation disappear. The talk of secession was obviously very well timed to get us talking but this so that he may pick it up when we have done doing the talking. I don’t see him making much headway on the ballot and secession will probably be the next phase of action. But what if that fails?  To Rule The Ruins Secession is rarely achieved through amicable terms. You have to go to war to split the country. If not, then do what he had tried to do in 1982: Go for the seat of power and rule Kenya from Nairobi. The big question is whether Raila is really capable of taking up arms against the Kenyan state. Can he really muscle his way through an armed revolution to either topple Jubilee out of power? Does he have the wherewithal, the purpose, the war matÃ©riel and the structural capabilities to hold and sustain a guerrilla movement? A casual look at his support bases shows there is no community that can easily take up arms thanks to the low level of militarization and a weak culture of militarism (unlike nearly all our neighbours). This, of course, can change in a short while but we are not there just yet. Violence, however, is a regional imperative in the quest for power and I dare say Kenya itself is not immune to situations of violence. Lord Varys in Game of Thrones, speaking about the power hungry Petyr Baelish, says, ‘…he would see this country burn if he could be king of the ashes.’ If NASA will opt for war, then they could quickly reduce the country into a pile of rubble if Raila could have his pound of flesh. And he will rule the ruins and be the King of the Ashes.
