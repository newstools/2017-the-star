It is a joy to celebrate milestones with your kid. And an even bigger one to celebrate a new year with them. Over the weekend, Jaguar celebrated his son Jay's birthday. Jaguar took to social media and wrote, "Happy birthday, son..." Kenyans as usual want to know everything about everyone. Ruth Exodus asked, "Kwani how many kids do you have, Jaguar?" This sparked an online debate. See the reactions.
