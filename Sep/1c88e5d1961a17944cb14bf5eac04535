Chebukati is not reflecting his position. He offered Chiloba as a sacrificial lamb," he said.Ababu, who was once in the Opposition, said the buck stops squarely with Chebukati as he has the executive authority to streamline the agency."Chebukati should stop this mind game...he is a leader. Chebukati, rise and lead. He is being sucked into the politics of both divides...he can rise from Jubilee and NASA."The Labour Party of Kenya leader further said the chairman should bring order and sanity into the commission if it is to "up its game"."IEBC should stop engaging in sideshows. Chebukati should bring order, sanity and peace...as a referee you have no business pointing fingers," he said."I want to see Chebukati leading a united team...it is an institution that has hold Kenya's destiny. IEBC should be focused on running elections so well that there will not be a single chance of a fallacy."Ababu further said the will of the people should not be sabotaged and that the chairman should ensure every aspect of the election is up to standard.IEBC commissioners are currently on a three-day retreat in Naivasha.Chiloba, Chebukati and others, who have fallen out following the just concluded general elections, are expected to resolve their differences at Great Rift Valley Lodge.An official within the electoral agency told The Star in confidence that the issues that have split the commissioners will be part of the retreat's agenda.The source admitted the fallout between some commissioners and the chairman, over the August 8 general election, has slowed the agency in its plan for a fresh poll."It is in the public domain that all is not well between the chairman, CEO and some commissioners. This will dominate the talks," the official said on Sunday.The official further added that the main reason for the meeting was to plan for repeat presidential election."Despite the fallout, the main reason for this meeting is to plan for the fresh election. We expect all the commissioners and senior staff to attend."Read: Chebukati, Chiloba to come face to face in Naivasha after explosive memoAlso read: State intimidating Chebukati to dance to its tune by withdrawing security - Wetang'ula
