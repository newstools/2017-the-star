Activist Okiya Omtatah has moved to the High Court in a bid to compel the IEBC to acquire new KIEMS kits for use in the October 26 repeat presidential election. Omtatah claims that the KIEMS kits that were used during the August 8 General Election must not be reconfigured for reuse in the poll and should be preserved for a period of three years. “IEBC has an obligation to protect the KIEMS kits alongside all other election materials for three years,” Omtatah said The activist claims he is aggrieved that, contrary to the provisions of the law, instead of the IEBC procuring new KIEMS kits, it plans to re-configure the ones used at the August poll, thereby destroying data stored in the gadgets. Omtatah said the materials are preserved because people may want to look at them to ascertain credibility in the conduct of the election.
