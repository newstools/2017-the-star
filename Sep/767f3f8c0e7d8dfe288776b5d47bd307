The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission has raised the alarm over refusal by MPs to commit to some Sections of the Leadership and Integrity Act, 2012.The EACC also accused the legislators of refusing to sign Regulation 34(1) of the Leadership and Integrity Regulation, 2015. A senior official at the commission yesterday said efforts to have them commit have been unsuccessful.A letter dated August 31 from the EACC to clerks of Parliament &mdash; Jeremiah Nyegenye (Senate) and Michael Sialai (National Assembly) &mdash; stated that members were expected to commit to Sections 37, 39(4) and 40 of LIA, 2012.&ldquo;Members of Parliament are required to sign and commit to a code, which satisfies the legal requirements,&rdquo; the letter signed by EACC CEO Halakhe Waqo (pictured) on August 31 reads.He said MPs must commit within seven days upon assumption of office.The legislators took the oath of office on August 31 and have until Thursday to append their signatures.Constitutional experts say they will be in breach of Chapter Six of the Constitution if they fail to sign and anyone can move to court and challenge their positions.It is understood the MPs claimed they are guided by the Parliamentary Powers and Privileges Act, 2017. Section 37(3) of the Act says, &ldquo;The Code of Conduct regulating the conduct of Members of the respective House of Parliament shall be as set out in the Fourth Schedule.&rdquo;The schedule says members are bound by the general principles of conduct whenever any of them performs the roles of either House of Parliament set out under Articles 95 and 96 of the Constitution.Yesterday, the Star could not reach Nyegene and Sialai for comment.
