Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago has named part of his Cabinet and dropped two of his key allies. He has appointed Julius Ruto as the Finance executive, replacing Shadrack Sambai, who has held the position for five years. Mandago has also named Joseph Kurgat as the new executive for Education, replacing Enoch Muigei. He retained Eng Gideon Birir as the Roads executive . Mandago named only three executives out of the 10 he will appoint. The county boss forwarded the three names to the county assembly for vetting by MCAs. “He will forward other names to the assembly in due course,” deputy speaker Hosea Lamai said. He said the assembly had approved members of the vetting committee. Speaker David Lagat will chair the committee.
