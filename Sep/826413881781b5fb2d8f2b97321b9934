That has to be our focus. Leave the courts alone."In his address to central leaders at Sagana State Lodge on Friday, he noted they want peace and that Wambugu should "let go"."All what we want is for the will of the people to prevail."Jubilee secretary general Raphael Tuju said the petition was a move by an individual, not the ruling coalition.Majority leaders Aden Duale and Kipchumba Murkomen have also piled pressure for the MP to withdraw the complaint.More on this: Ngunjiri Wambugu files petition seeking removal of CJ Maraga over Uhuru verdictAlso read: Duale, Murkomen pile pressure for Ngunjiri to drop Maraga petitionOn Wednesday, the President revealed the top court's decision left him pained but he noted his problem is not with the Kisii community.Uhuru reiterated his victory was "stolen in broad daylight" and said the court should have "at least directed that ballot papers be counted afresh".Read: 'Hata wewe ungesikia aje?'
