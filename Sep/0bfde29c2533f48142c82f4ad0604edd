Churchill Raw’s comedian and host MC Jessy has not had an easy journey. Jessy, real name Jasper Muthomi, told Word Is the many jobs he had been doing before he became a celebrity. “After finishing school, I came to Nairobi to look for a job, and because I didn’t have a place to stay, my classmate’s parents took me in. It was easy for them to accommodate me because their son used to stay at our place when he came to Meru.” He added, “They were seven of them and were living at a small house in Kawangware, so we used to sell mandazi every morning. Their mother would tell me to sell five extra mandazis and pay myself with them. During the day, we sold chips mwitu. That’s why to date, I’m a good cook. I know how to chop potatoes for making fries.” After staying with them for months, Jessy moved on to another friend’s house. “One day, I was in town and met up with an old friend. We went to their home in one of the leafy suburbs and I started staying with them. His father was an MP at that time and he saw our friendship with his son. Funny enough, he made me his shamba boy. I used to wash clothes and cook.”
