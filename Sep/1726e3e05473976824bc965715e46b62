Coleen Rooney has told her football star husband Wayne to give up gambling and stop seeing Wes Brown if he wants to save their marriage. The 31-year-old landed himself in hot water after he was arrested during a night out with party girl Laura Simpson, 29. He was pulled over by police and later admitted drink driving at Stockport Magistrates' Court. The Everton star has been trying to make it up to his wife Coleen, 31, who is pregnant with their fourth child. She has now told her husband to ditch his best friend and former Manchester United teammate because she feels he is a bad influence on him, reports The Sun. According to the newspaper, the mother-of-three feels it was not a coincidence that Wayne was with Wes when he was caught behind the wheel. The former England stars were also together when Wayne lost half a million pounds at a casino in Manchester back in May. 'With Wes out of the scene, she hopes Wayne will become more of a stay-at-home family man.' Five years ago the pair were photographed in a casino in Las Vegas shortly before Wayne was about to captain the England side at Euro 2012. It comes as Coleen took their two youngest sons for a day out in Blackpool over the weekend - without her husband or her wedding ring. On Monday morning, she shared a picture of herself with Klay, four, and Kit, 21 months, standing next to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle models. She uploaded the photograph to her Instagram page and wrote: 'A day out at Blackpool is always fun.'
