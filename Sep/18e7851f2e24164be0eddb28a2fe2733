By now, the world should be familiar with Kamau Mbonisi Kwame Agyeman, simply known as Kamau. From his previous EP, â€œA Gorgeous Fortuneâ€, to his latest release, he has managed to define his style; itâ€™s purposeful, original and unconventional. Kamau has always been the ideal nonconformist when it comes to music. His recently released EP, TheKamau-Cassette: Å­RTH GÅLD, is the perfect continuation of his strive to position himself as one of the artistes to reckon with. Thematically, in its entirety, the project packs the needed creative verve that makes it appear to have been keenly thought out. The 11-track project is not your typical album. This is quite obvious in the unique way he names his tracks, which are styled differently from what we are used. His works borrow bits from various cultures, fused with the contemporary sound. Essential tracks on the album include â€œPÅ­RL,â€ â€œCÅ­NÄƒRÃ­,â€ â€œPÄ­TCH,â€ â€œLÄƒVÄ­NDÅ­R,â€ â€œNÄVÃ­,â€ BÅ­RGÅ­NDÃ­â€ and â€œGÅLDâ€. Only two guest features make it on the over 30-minute long project: NkÅ KhÃ©lÃ­ on â€œGRÄâ€ and Talibah Safiya on â€œMÄ­NTâ€. Kamauâ€™s vocals, whose range and delivery reside on the extreme end of whatever emotional spectrum heâ€™s conveying, amplify his fervour as never seen before. He is able to swiftly change from rap to song and back effortlessly. Whether the artiste is talking about romance or himself, he gets specific enough to make the song sound as heavy as it ought to be. His verses are strong and his lyricism is faultless. Kamau is an imaginative soul and makes every piece of work seem fun. TheKamau-Cassette is one the most promising releases this year. It is quite rewarding and adventurous at the same time. You have to give it to Kamau for creating such as impactful, EP despite his unpopularity. In execution, it comes out as a brilliant concept, an award-winning idea. For what itâ€™s worth, this is an EP you need to have on repeat for the next couple of weeks. Star Rating:  4/5
