Embakasi East MP Babu Owino was yesterday arrested and taken to DCI headquarters on Kiambu Road over remarks he is said to have made about the President. Police sources said he would be held overnight and is expected to appear in court today. During a rally in Kawangware’s Congo area on Sunday, the first-time MP tore into someone he referred to as “mtoto wa mbwa”. He likened this person to long-term African leaders who were eventually removed from power. Babu later said he would not apologise and dared police to arrest him, as referring to someone as a puppy doesn’t amount to abuse. Speaking to the Star on the phone shortly after being arrested, Babu said he is innocent. The MP said he did not name any politician in his address. “I’m innocent. If you watch the clip...you tell me...Who did I abuse? No one.” Earlier, Nairobi woman representative Esther Passaris condemned the remarks as unfortunate and apologised to the First Family. She urged politicians to responsibly exercise their right to freedom of speech. “Freedom of speech comes with responsibility...I beg my fellow politicians and Kenyans on both sides of the divide not to abuse this freedom, whether on social media or otherwise,” Passaris said in a Facebook post.
