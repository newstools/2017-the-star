A 50kt device would be about three times the size of the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima in 1945."War is never something the United States wants," she said. "We don't want it now but our country's patience is not unlimited."China's envoy to the UN, Liu Jieyi, reiterated a call for all sides to return to negotiations."The peninsula issue must be resolved peacefully," he said. "China will never allow chaos and war on the peninsula."Speaking in Berne, Swiss President Doris Leuthard pointed to her country and Sweden's long record in neutral and discreet diplomacy."I think it really is time for dialogue," she said. "We are ready to offer our role for good services as a mediator. I think in the upcoming weeks a lot will depend on how the US and China can have an influence in this crisis."
