Former Lamu assembly speaker Hashim Fumo has criticised the Supreme Court for annulling the presidential election results. He said the four judges ruling in NASA’s favour, led by Chief Justice David Maraga and deputy CJ Philomena Mwilu, were not fair. Fumo said a presidential contest is sensitive and must be handled with a lot of care. “The Supreme Court should not have handled the nullification of the presidential results casually and should have given priority to the country’s security,” he said during a press conference at Jubilee Hall on Sunday. Fumo said despite the judiciary having the final say in presidential election petitions, it should have handled the NASA petition in a “sober way”
