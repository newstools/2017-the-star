A Pokot man was killed by suspected Turkana bandits on his way to his house in Karon village along the county's border with West Pokot. Kases location chief Joseph Korkimul said the 60-year-old was shot once in the back and four times in the head by a gang of about six. "Kenya Police Reservists who were nearby tried to pursue the bandits but they escaped towards Kakong area in Turkana county," Korkimul said on Monday. "We received reports in the morning that a number of bandits from Turkana county had invaded Karon village and are planning to raid villages." The death of the 60-year-old man has sparked tension at the border and it is said some of the bandits only kill. Korkimul said he immediately informed GSU and AP officers of the murder and that they were deployed to guard the area. Elders and security leaders from West Pokot and Turkana county are set to hold a security meeting on Tuesday. Livestock  from the Turkana and Pokot communities will be handed back.
