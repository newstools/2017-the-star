Kenya Airways has evaluated the efficiency of its network to maximise productivity with the rollout of a new Winter Schedule. In the new schedule, Kenya Airways will discontinue flights to Hong Kong and Hanoi, Vietnam, from October 29, 2017 to optimize its route network. This move will allow Kenya Airways to operate with a better schedule to Asia with a daily flight to Bangkok and Guangzhou. The airline will continue to serve Hong Kong and Hanoi through its partners. This network change will also allow KQ to allocate more seats across its African network where the demand outlook remains strong and capacity insufficient on certain routes. â€œThis network decision will help Kenya Airways to strengthen its focus on Africa. We will continue to serve our customers to Asia through our direct flights to China and Thailand and work closely with our partners to cover the Asian continent,â€ said Kenya Airways commercial director, Vincent Coste. Kenya Airways is constantly assessing its network in order to position its fleet where there is strong demand. With markets' demand constantly changing, KQ is becoming more agile with this exercise. A week ago, KQ said it is planning to focus on Africa, Europe and the USA market, cutting down on the loss-making highly-competitive Asian routes which are dominated by gulf and some regional airlines like Ethopia and Rwanda Air.
