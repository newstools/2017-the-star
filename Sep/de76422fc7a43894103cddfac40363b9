Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho is this week expected to name his 10-member Cabinet. A number of people who served during Joho’s first term are expected to make a comeback since the positions were not advertised. Joho has, however, remained mum on this issue and is held up in Nairobi campaigning for NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga. Joho is ODM’s deputy party leader and it would not be a good look for him not to be actively participating in campaigns. County director of communication Richard Chacha yesterday said he is not sure who is on the Cabinet list, but it will be out soon. The MCAs, who were sworn last week, will vet the 10 executives. Joho’s preferred candidates are likely to sail through unopposed because ODM has the majority in the assembly. Twenty-seven of the 30 elected MCAs are from ODM. Ford Kenya and Wiper have one representative each and there is one independent. After their swearing in, the MCAs elected Aharub Khatri, Joho’s close ally, as speaker. Joho has to strike a balance among politics, religion and ethnicity because Mombasa is cosmopolitan. Joho is said to be consulting widely before naming his cabinet. Executive appointments are seen as rewards to people who supported Joho’s reelection bid. In 2013, Joho’s government was made up of executives from the Luo, Somali, Kikuyu, Kalenjin, Mijikenda and Swahili communities. Immediately after assuming office in 2013, Joho named Tendai Lewa as the Education executive, Anthony Njaramba (Tourism), Francis Thoya (Lands), Binty Omar (Agriculture) and Mohammed Abbas (Transport). Others were Joab Tumbo (Health), Mohammed Abdi (Trade), Walid Khalid (Finance) and Fatma Awale was in charge of Environment.
