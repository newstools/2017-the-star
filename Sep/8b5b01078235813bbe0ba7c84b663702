The national government has sent more than 2,000 bags of relief food to the Boni communities and IDPs in Lamu county. The communities fled their Jima, Pandanguo and Poromoko homes because of al Shabaab attacks. Many of the victims live in the Katsaka Kairu camp and the Witu AIC Church, Witu. Lamu county commissioner Gilbert Kitiyo yesterday said his office had received maize, rice and beans, and cartons of cooking fat. He said the food is ready for distribution to vulnerable groups. Operation Linda Boni — a multiagency intervention to flush out Shabaab militants from Boni Forest — is ongoing. The food programme was launched shortly after the operation began. The Boni community on Monday complained after the government stopped the programme. The state is sending cash through M-Pesa. Kitiyo said more than 2,500 IDPs in camps will benefit. He said the state will continue supporting victims, including those in drought areas. He said schools in Basuba, Milimani, Mararani, Mangai, Kiangwe and Pandanguo, which remain shut, will be reopened.
