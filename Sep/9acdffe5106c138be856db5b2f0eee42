NASA leader Raila Odinga yesterday threatened to mobilise millions of supporters to boycott the services of giant corporations he said have ganged up to stifle democracy. “That time is coming, but it has not yet come. We may be forced to do it in our struggle for democracy and progress,” Raila said. The opposition leader said the same happened in South Africa against the apartheid regime. The ex-prime minister warned that some big corporations, which he did not name, were part and parcel of subverting the growth of democracy in Kenya. “We are considering beginning an economic boycott of products and corporations that are working against the interests of the people of Kenya,” Raila said at the Okoa Kenya secretariat offices in Nairobi. In a stinging attack on Safaricom, Raila accused the leading mobile service provider of illegal conduct in last month’s polls. “We specifically said Safaricom colluded with OT-Morpho and routed results to servers abroad but made no provision to return those results back to Kenya,” he said. On Tuesday, Safaricom chief executive officer Bob Collymore said the firm is open about the role it played in the poll. Raila demanded that the IEBC explains how results were transmitted from its server in France saying “as long as the IEBC, OT-Morpho, Safaricom and Al Ghurair are in charge of poll, nothing will change in October.” He claimed that the Communications Authority was part of the cartel that is killing democracy. But in a terse statement, the CA warned that such political statements are likely to undermine the gains made in the ICT sector. He told politicians to report any poll malpractices in the ICT industry to the relevant law enforcement instead of “engaging in blanket lynching of investors in the sector.” Unlike in 2013 when Safaricom singularly transmitted results, Telkom and Airtel were contracted to do the transmission during the August 8 poll.
