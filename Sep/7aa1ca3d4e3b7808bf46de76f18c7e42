Trans Nzoia county assembly speaker Joshua Werunga has pledged to work with Governor Patrick Khaemba for the sake of development. Speaking on Monday after a meeting at the governor’s office, Werunga said needs of Trans Nzoia people are more important than party politics. He said those hoping he will torment the executive leadership because of different political alignments should forget it. “We need to expedite projects, pass bills and initiate more. Considering all these, you realise we have no space to engage in narrow partisan politics and unnecessary sideshows,”  Werunga said. Khaemba said his government will be inclusive ,regardless of political parties or tribal inclinations. He attributed  stagnant development during his first term to constant bickering by MCAs and sabotage by political parties.
