Representation wars have started in Kiambu county, with Lari residents accusing Governor Ferdinand Waititu’s government of sidelining them during the nomination of MCAs. Kinale, Kijabe, Lari Kirenga, Kamburu and Nyanduma wards form part of Lari constituency. Kinale MCA loser Ann Wanjiku has filed a petition at the High Court in Kiambu, and other aspirants have filed complaints at the Office of the Ombudsman. Wanjiku sued seeking the degazettement of six nominated women. In her sworn affidavit, Wanjiku said the process was unclear, adding that Jubilee Party officials only told the nominated MCAs to apply for the slots. She urged the court to order the clerk of the county assembly to add her name to the list of nominees. The case filed last Wednesday was set for hearing on September 26.  MCAs were sworn in last week. Wanjiku, who lost to Dominic Mugo during JP primaries, said her rival has been campaigning for Jubilee candidates. Residents have expressed concern no seat out of the 27 slots has been set aside for an MCA from the constituency. The county nominated 27 women after only Bibirioni ward elected a woman - Jackie Nungari. There are 60 wards and 12 constituencies in Kiambu. Politician John Burugu said no explanation has been given for why Lari was left out. He said, “Some constituencies have up to four nominees. How sure are we our able residents will be considered for other county jobs once they apply? We will push until something is done.” Burugu ran for MP as an independent. Lari Resource Trust member Joseph Maina urged the Ombudsman to investigate. “MCAs know how to lobby. We need the support of our elected ones,” he said.
