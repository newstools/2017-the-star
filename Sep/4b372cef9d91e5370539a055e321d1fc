A private firm has sued German and British companies seeking Sh13 billion arising from $250 million (Sh26b) 35 megawatt Homa Bay hyacinth-to-energy plant.The company, Watts Dynamics Limited, says it initiated the power project but the same was taken over by other companies without proper compensation.Through lawyer Donald Kipkorir, Watts says there was breach of contract and now wants the court to order that it be paid billions in compensation.Watts says it negotiated for and obtained express approval from the Ministry of Energy for the proposed 35MW biomass power plant and acquired land for it from Homa Bay county.The company further conceptualized the idea for the power plant to run on hyacinth and developed the same between 1998 and 2008.It conducted successful laboratory tests and sought partners to undertake feasibility tests for the plant project.In January 2014, it shared the information on the power plant project with German African Energy Council and Petschow &amp; Thiel Projektmanagement GMBH for review on technical and economic viability.On March 7, 2014 a formal application for the power plant was submitted to the ministry.It was agreed that Watts will follow up with approval of the project by the ministry, do site negotiations with Homa Bay County and source for debt covering 50 per cent of capital cost.The other two companies were tasked with driving the project from a technical and financial perspective. They were also to take care of provision of all finances to complete the project.But in August same year, the project was approved in favour of a company called Thika Way Investment Limited.According to suit papers, the shareholders of Thika Way Investment are Frank Petschow, Uwe Detlef Kurt Dolves, Mary Wangui Horst, Karl Benno Naggy and Soren Wendler who are linked to the two foreign companies.Watts now claims that the two foreign companies fraudulently incorporated Thika Way Investment without allocating the 35 per cent shareholding that the parties had initially agreed upon.In February 2015, the two foreign companies walked out of the arrangement with Watts after approvals and permits had been issued.Watts adds it was not compensated at all.
