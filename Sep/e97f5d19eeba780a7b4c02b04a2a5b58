International tourists are arriving in Mombasa despite the  political uncertainty in the country. The country is still in an election mood, after the Supreme Court nullified President Uhuru Kenyatta’s victory and ordered a fresh poll in 60 days. Yesterday, three international flights, Neos (Italy), Condor (German) and Turkish Airlines of Turkey landed at the Moi International Airport with hundreds of tourists, both for the local market and those on transit to other countries within the region. As countries marked World Tourism Day, which is commemorated on September 27 every year, Kenya has remained one of the world nations known for its tourism heritage. Neos makes two flights to Mombasa every week on Wednesday, Condor has four flights to Mombasa every week and Turkish Airlines makes daily flights to the port city. Yesterday, Neos brought in 80 tourists for the local market and the additional 106 were heading to Zanzibar in neighbouring Tanzania. Hoteliers and tour operators yesterday thronged the Moi International Airport to welcome the flights coming in with guests. The guests were treated to local traditional dances.
