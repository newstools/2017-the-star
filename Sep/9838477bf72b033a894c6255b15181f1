Opposition MCAs in Migori on Tuesday led residents in peaceful demonstrations calling for removal of some IEBC officials before the presidential rerun. The members held their demonstrations across Migori town, then headed to the county IEBC offices. They wanted IEBC chief executive Ezra Chiloba and other officials accused of bungling the August 8 election to quit before the repeat presidential election on October 26. Riot police stood guard at the IEBC offices as demonstrators (pictured) chanted slogans against Chiloba and President Uhuru Kenyatta. They sang the praises of NASA and Chief Justice David Maraga. Led by Oruba-Ragana MCA Mallan Ogega, the demonstrators also called for the reinstatement of full security for NASA principals. “The voice of Migori residents is clear. We won’t have an election if Chiloba and other IEBC officials, who bungled the election, are still in office,” Ogega said. He said they will continue with the protests until reforms are carried out at the IEBC.
