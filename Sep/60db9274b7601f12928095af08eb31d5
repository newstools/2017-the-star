Garissa Governor Ali Korane yesterday accused his predecessor Nathif Jama of presiding over corruption. “I’m inheriting a government that not only failed to implement development programmes, but also allowed rampant corruption and a bloated workforce,” he said in his 30-minute maiden speech at the county assembly. Korane said a properly functioning government must be lean and have simple structures. This was not the case with the Jama administration, he said, blaming it for the “unsustainable” Sh5.4 million annual wage bill. Jama lost to Korane at the August 8 poll, but has challenged his victory in court. He says the poll was mired in irregularities and defends his record. Korane said the county’s recurrent expenditure is 69 per cent of the budget and this has undermined development. His administration is auditing all sectors of the economy to streamline services and do away with unnecessary expenditure. The county leadership will not allow nonperformance, Korane said. The new county chief said residents deserve efficient services. This is their right and it must be protected at any cost, he added. Korane urged MCAs to oversight his administration “as expected of you because you represent the public interest”. “My administration is duty-bound to work with the legislative arm to enhance checks and balances. I want to assure you that officials tasked with county responsibilities will honour summons by your honourable committees so you can hold them accountable to our people,” he said. Korane said his team will deliver water for drought sufferers. He will seek support from the national government and other development partners, he said. Korane said he is talking with the nurses’ union to resolve the ongoing strike. The county will improve health services by making available adequate drugs and other medical supplies, the governor said.
