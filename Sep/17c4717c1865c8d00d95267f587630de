Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company workers have threatened another boycott over the board of directors it says tried to sell the firm.The board says, however, the union, some workers and cartels want to sabotage its reforms.Kenya County Government Workers&rsquo; Union branch secretary Jebet Matilda yesterday said the board is still in place, despite the governor&rsquo;s public announcement that he had suspended it.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have faith in this board. They wanted to sell this company and that made us lose faith them,&rdquo; she said.The board has accused union officials of being &ldquo;a gang for hire&rdquo; bent on sabotaging and frustrating its operations and reforms.Governor Mike Sonko verbally suspended the board on August 22 when he visited the firm to calm the workers protesting the sacking of MD Philip Gichuki and three other managers by the board.Sonko promised to write an official suspension letter to the board the following day. But yesterday, board chairman Raphael Nzomo said they have not received the letter.demoralisedRepeated calls to the governor&rsquo;s office have not been answered.The firm is a public corporation under the Nairobi government.

I want to leave it gold. That is why the board and I have been trying to streamline the operations of the firm,&rdquo; Nzomo said.It is said some managers and long-serving staff, believed linked to cartels controlling supply and distribution of water, have been resisting transfers and oppose reforms.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want a scenario where I, as the chairman, have to be called by a resident so he or she can get water,&rdquo; Nzomo said.&ldquo;Some people are intentionally blocking supply to some areas so that they can individually benefit. That is what we are fighting.&rdquo;
