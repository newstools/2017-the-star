Nyeri MP Wambugu Ngunjiri has filed a petition against Chief Justice David Maraga question the judge's suitability.This came days after the Supreme Court nullified President Uhuru Kenyatta's win during the August 8 general election."We must understand that Maraga does not overturn the will of the people,15 million people.. but he has allowed a clique of people to influence him," he told journalists on Thursday.The Nyeri Town MP said Maraga must be removed from office over what he called 'gross misconduct' following the ruling."I am challenging his conduct. We have had a lot of judicial issues. What we have is a group of people who have taken captive of the judiciary," he said.Ngunjiri said he has concrete evidence that he will table before court to ensure Maraga is removed from the Judiciary. In his historic decision on September 1, the CJ nullified Uhuru's win saying IEBC did not conduct the elections as stipulated in the law.But his decision, which was welcomed by many as a rare sign of independence of Kenya's judiciary, did not go well with the Jubilee Party.After the ruling, Uhuru said if he wins the October 17 vote, he will 'fix' the Judiciary.The president called the chief justice a crook in some of the personalised attacks shaping the fresh election political discourse.An Mp denounced NASA leader Raila Odinga as the devil who needs a whipping. Raila accused the president of making a public speech while drunk.Gloves are off as Jubilee party and the opposition battle for votes ahead of the new election.The biggest worry in Kenya is violence taking on an ethnic dimension, as in 2007.Uhuru is from the largest of Kenya's 44 tribes, the Kikuyu, while many of Raila's supporters believe his Luo ethnic group has been locked out of power.More on this: Kenya election campaigns turn personal after court orders fresh pollsMore to follow
