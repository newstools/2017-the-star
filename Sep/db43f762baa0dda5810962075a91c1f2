Raila Odinga's NASA coalition could block the repeat presidential election in its strongholds unless its demands for changes at the IEBC are met.Raila, his running mate Kalonzo Musyoka and their presidential chief campaigner Musalia Mudavadi yesterday launched a nationwide campaign to block the Wafula Chebukati-led IEBC from holding the election until radical reforms are done.National Super Alliance leaders have said they do not trust the electoral commission as currently constituted and want 12 staff members they believe contributed greatly to the bungled August 8 presidential poll to be barred from overseeing the upcoming poll."Officers who facilitated the display of figures purporting them to be results but which at the Supreme Court hearing were disowned by the Commission as mere statistics must get out of the way. That is where reforms at the IEBC will begin."Kenyans are coming for you. Salvage what you can and run. There will be no election with you in office," Raila said.Deputy President William Ruto, however, hit at the NASA leaders and maintained that the election will be held next month as scheduled by the IEBC."Every Kenyan, those at the IEBC included, has the protection of the Constitution. Nobody, however mighty, should threaten them in any way or form," Ruto said on his Twitter handle.IEBC commissioners Abdi Guliye and Molu Boya, CEO Ezra Chiloba, his deputies Betty Nyabuto and Marijan Hussein Marijan, Immaculate Kassait (Voter Registration director), James Muhati (ICT director) and Praxedes Tororey (Legal Services director) are among senior officials the Opposition want removed.Chiloba's legal advisor Moses Kipkogey is targeted in the opposition's push for reforms.NASA has also opposed three IEBC officials Chebukati appointed as new blood and considered them as his &acirc;&#128;&#156;project team&acirc;&#128;&#157; to oversee the repeat presidential poll. Members of the project team, mostly returning officers in the August 8 General Election, included Sidney Namulungu (Kisii), Nancy Kariuki (Mombasa) and Silas Rotich (Nakuru).The three are accused of declaring final results from "fake forms"."Are we counting on the very institutions and individuals who participated in a coup against the people of Kenya and tried to install a defeated candidate as winner to ensure an accountable counting, tallying, transmission and transparency of results? Our answer is No," Raila said at a press conference at Panari Hotel in Nairobi.He pointed out that NASA is a force that will not only uproot the "evil of sham elections with a pre-determined outcome" in Kenya but also end electoral fraud in Africa.The NASA flagbearer said that institutions cannot reform when led by people opposed to reforms in defending the coalition&acirc;&#128;&#153;s push for changes at the IEBC before he faces his arch-rival President Uhuru Kenyatta in the repeat poll."We shall sensitize our people about the reforms that must take place before they can be called to another election. As the Opposition, we have instituted reforms to the election process before. We shall do it again. That is our focus and our goal," Raila said.The Opposition also maintains that the Dubai-based Al Ghurair Printing &amp; Publishing firm contracted by the IEBC to print ballot papers and the French-basedfirms Saffran and Morpho that supplied the elections kits cannot be trusted for their services in the upcoming poll."This is disturbing but easy to understand. The IEBC and Jubilee are partners in crime. The two need each other. If Jubilee is in power, it will protect the co-conspirators and fraudsters in the IEBC. Those IEBC officials have every reason to protect Jubilee as their only source of protection," Raila said.NASA co-principal and Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang&acirc;&#128;&#153;ula, flanked by the coalition&acirc;&#128;&#153;s MPs at a press conference at Parliament last Thursday, said they will not boycott the planned October election, instead "there will be no election."Jubilee Party secretary general Raphael Tuju challenged NASA to come clear how they intend to stop the presidential rematch election if Raila was not withdrawing from the race by notifying the IEBC in advance through writing."We have noted with amusement the threats by NASA that they will not participate in the forthcoming election. If they really mean what they say, let them show bravery and write to the IEBC," Tuju said.NASA legal counsel speaking over the weekend during a rally in Siaya county hinted at a possibility of using their 18 governors across the country to block the IEBC from conducting the poll in their regions."You know when we tell them there will be no election they think we will boycott. We mean there will be no election in this country. If Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho, Cornel Rasanga (Siaya), Josphat Nanok (Turkana) say no, can we have an election in Mombasa, Siaya and Turkana counties?" Orengo said in his Dholuo dialect.Orengo, captured in a video clip, added that he would lead NASA leaders in ensuring that no election is conducted in the cosmopolitan Nairobi city county under the leadership of Jubilee's Governor Mike Sonko.A scheme to block the election in NASA regions means only 27 Jubilee-controlled counties would participate in the exercise.Orengo last Thursday in Rarieda constituency threatened to use a "secret weapon" to have NASA electoral reforms demands addressed.The Siaya senator vowed that NASA would only unleash the weapon should Jubilee conspire with the electoral commission to interfere with the repeat presidential poll.Raila and his co-principals during a rally yesterday in Jacaranda Grounds in Embakasi East constituency, Nairobi, affirmed that they are ready for the polls but their demands must be met first."The irreducible minimums must be fulfilled before we go to a repeat presidential election. We are ready but we are ready on our own terms," said Raila.Raila also dismissed threats by French company Safran to sue NASA for defamation, saying "a thief cannot probe itself."Raila also claimed Uhuru is plotting to use Jubilee's "fake" majority to introdce constitutional change which will take Kenya back to the old dark days.NASA claimed Jubilee wants to, among other things, change the law on presidential term limits, remove the constitutional security of Supreme Court judges and remove use of technology in election management."It was not a Wambugu petition but Uhuru's petition," said Raila.Former presidential candidate James ole Kiyiapi said on his Twitter handle yesterday, "Today, I call upon Jubilee and NASA to come to the table, negotiate minimum conditions for the repeat election and let the country move forward."
