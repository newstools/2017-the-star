Some leaders have become pretenders, imposters, brokers and auctioneers aspiring to auction the Luhya vote to the highest bidder in Jubilee, some Western elected leaders in NASA have said.In a statement they said the visit to State House by some election losers last week was purely financial and to beg for jobs.&ldquo;[President] Uhuru Kenyatta should be advised that these ruthless, rudderless rejected job-seekers, who failed to secure votes for themselves, are hyenas hunting in a pack for the spoils of war. Their political sell-by date expired a long time ago,&rdquo; the statement says.They said the leaders are &ldquo;wolves in sheepskin&rdquo; and traitors to their people.They mentioned former Vihiga Governor Moses Akaranga, former presidential candidate Cyrus Jirongo, former Bungoma governor aspirant Alfred Khang&rsquo;ati, former Nambale MP Chris Okemo, Water CS Eugene Wamalwa, former Bungoma Governor Kenneth Lusaka, Kenneth Marende, former Westlands MP Fred Gumo, Noah Wekesa and former Budalang&rsquo;i MP Ababu Namwamba.Wamalwa led a delegation of Luhya leaders to State House on September 4 and they pledged to support Uhuru&rsquo;s reelection. Most of them were losers in the August 8 election.Jubilee has embraced them and hopes to use them to increase its votes in Western in the repeat polls set for October 17.The statement said that the &ldquo;political fraudsters went to State House to seek protection from prosecution for wrongdoing in public offices they previously served, or are pursuing reprieve from cases they face in courts.&ldquo;We, the legitimately elected leaders from the Western region, want to state categorically that we are united and our communities are no less united under NASA, and in support of our presidential candidate Raila Odinga.&rdquo;The leaders also said they are aware of a planned shepherding of chiefs to recruit them as Jubilee campaigners.The statement was signed by 31 elected leaders in Western.
