The 31st US President, Herbert Hoover, once said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;A whole people with the ballot in their hands possess the most conclusive and unlimited power ever entrusted to humanity.&acirc;&#128;&#157; Nothing better underscores the importance of the ballot, the need to protect it and the desire for every citizen to exercise their will through it, than this quote.Following the Supreme Court decision to nullify the August 8 presidential election based on the management deficiencies of the IEBC, there is unending debate on the will of the people and the ballot.In fact, there are even questions on why the good judges never found it wise to order a recount of every vote. This would have ensured that we all decide on whether each and every one of those ballots was counted and not just the forms and the electronic transmission.The basis of the NASA petition was the breakdown of the electronic system and this is why we need to have a proper conversation on the issue. NASA did not argue about the votes and never said President Uhuru Kenyatta did not get the declared results.NASA knew from the word go that they did not have the votes and so instead focused on the electronic transmission, which they knew had issues.They knew that it was possible to use the electronic system to ensure friendly officials in their strongholds sent the wrong information.We must, therefore, as a country, ask ourselves, what if the electronic transmission once again becomes inadequate when we head to the fresh election on October 17? What if more presiding officers were compromised to ensure there were inadequacies, as was seen in the August 8 polls?Instead of making the backup system manual, the IEBC should have the mandate to choose either that or the electronic system, based on its preparedness.The IEBC should be given the full duty to exercise its mandate as outlined in the Constitution.Under the Bill of Rights, Kenyans have the right to cast their vote and these votes must count. We cannot have a failed system nullifying the will of the people when they queued to make their choice as represented by those ballot papers.We must also decide whether opening the ballot boxes and counting each vote should be the only thing that can be used to nullify a presidential election.Recounting of votes also helps us in other ways necessary for advancing our democracy. It will allow us to know who will be held liable for charging Kenyans Sh12 billion for a fresh election and 60 days of political uncertainty that are hitting our economy hard.With Parliament opened, first on the agenda must be an evaluation of the digital transmission vs manual transmission or a hybrid of the two. We must go to the October 17 election with a clear plan on how this is going to be done.Parliament must also come up with a clear legal framework on how Supreme Court decisions are arrived at, concerning election nullification. Even before the full judgment is out, it is clear that, as outlined by the two dissenting judges, there was no demonstrated evidence the election was flawed.It is also important that MPs also come up with a system of protecting IEBC officials from unwarranted attacks and intimidation from those who lose in elections.It will clearly be wrong for us to go to the polls with a system that is not fully fine-tuned and give losers an excuse to follow the same precedents currently set.They say insanity is doing things the same way over and over again and expecting different outcomes. We will be fools as Kenyans to go into the fresh election with the same system that does not protect the sanctity of the ballot as it should.
