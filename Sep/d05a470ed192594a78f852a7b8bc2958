Where is he who built the pyramid? Is he not buried in its stone? And will the pyramid, one day, not be buried under sand? If all things shall pass, why worry for today? Therefore, let us not be anxious and filled with worry as it will not add a second to our lives. &acirc;&#128;&#148; Anonymous.Kenyans are apprehensive regarding the nation&acirc;&#128;&#153;s future and perhaps rightly so! Our national leaders are locked in a war of words. Sabre-rattling, chest-thumping, destructive rhetoric and endless innuendo are the order of the day. Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila Odinga are talking &acirc;&#128;&#152;at each other and not to one another.&acirc;&#128;&#153; Citizens are caught in the cross-fire and it&acirc;&#128;&#153;s not pretty.This unhappy situation is accelerating ethnic tensions and raising political temperatures. How did we get here? Why did we elect leaders obviously lacking in emotional intelligence? When did the rain start beating us and what options are open to us? Or do we just sit back and watch two men lead us to war and destruction?The United States of America&acirc;&#128;&#153;s government, God bless their souls, have summoned the President and opposition leader to a round table meeting in the hope of breaking the impasse. One can&acirc;&#128;&#153;t believe that it has taken a foreign government to point out their recklessness and folly. All right-thinking Kenyans should be ashamed, very ashamed of their leadership.Recent attacks on the Judiciary, in particular the Supreme Court and the person of Chief Justice David Maraga, have been deeply disturbing. That the Executive can overtly harass, intimidate and malign the head of another arm of government is an assault on the Republic of Kenya. That the Deputy President repeated the threats in rapid succession is a confirmation that this was a plan and not a &acirc;&#128;&#152;slip of the tongue&acirc;&#128;&#153; or accident.If anything ever happens to Chief Justice David Maraga, we now know where to start the investigation. The older Kenyans recall with horror how then Uganda President Idi Amin Dada harassed, intimidated and eventually murdered Chief Justice Benedicto Kiwanuka. A good man and excellent jurist was murdered by a semi-literate ignoramus for defending the Constitution of Uganda.Maraga deserves respect and not condemnation by all Kenyans. He has restored our faith in the rule of law and as a consequence, talk of secession in certain parts of Kenya has taken a back seat.For this alone, he deserves the highest national honour(s). Kenya is now high up on the list of emerging democracies as a result of the leadership of this quiet, self-effacing gentleman. I can predict the Law Society of Kenya, the East African Law Society and the International Commission of Jurists honouring this extraordinary man.In the meantime, Kenyan politicos are busy plotting to hound him out of office, thus confirming the words of Jesus Christ, &acirc;&#128;&#156;that a prophet is not known in his own home&acirc;&#128;&#157;.Our leaders need to think outside the box or get out of the way lest they be run-over! Personal desire for political power must never be allowed to override the interests of 42 million Kenyans. It is as senseless as it is moronic. Two men must not be allowed to use all other Kenyans as cannon fodder in their pursuit of personal political power.The Republic of Kenya will not cease to exist if Uhuru Kenyatta or Raila Odinga is not President. We can surgically excise them through the ballot and get on with our lives. We must not submit to being held hostage. They both suffer from a distorted sense of entitlement and are deluded by illusions of grandeur.Kenyans must liberate themselves from this destructive Kenyatta-Odinga dynasty. Other women have birthed sons and daughters who are equally deserving of the Presidency. The construct of tribes and tribal kingpins must be discarded if Kenya is to move forward. The people united can never be defeated.
