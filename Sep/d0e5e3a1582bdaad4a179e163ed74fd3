Lamu Governor Fahim Twaha's bodyguards narrowly escaped death on Sunday after their vehicle rolled several times at Mkunumbi area on the Lamu-Garsen highway. The driver and a civilian also survived the 11am incident that involved the Governor's official vehicle. Twaha was not with them at the time of the accident. It happened when the driver applied emergency brakes to avoid a herd of cattle that emerged on the road. The Governor's personal assistant Paul Wainaina said the vehicle rolled as a result of braking abruptly. He said the four, who have minor injuries, were heading to Lamu on an official engagement.
