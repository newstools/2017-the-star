Money is power. And for many women, especially those from rural areas, its absence means lack of self-sufficiency. But the situation is not much better for women in urban centres working in formal employment.The &acirc;&#128;&#152;ILO Women at Work: Trends 2016&acirc;&#128;&#153; shows the gender pay gap between women and men persists across a wide spectrum of the global labour market.Governments and the civil society have tried to bring about gender equality, but a huge gap remains when it comes to financial inclusion, trade participation and leadership.According to a World Bank report in 2014, of the two billion unbanked people worldwide, the majority &acirc;&#128;&#148; 1.1 billion ( 55 per cent) &acirc;&#128;&#148; are women. Seventeen per cent of the unbanked are from sub-Saharan Africa, and most of them live in rural areas.Some of the reasons cited in the World Bank report on why people remain unbanked include inadequate money to necessitate an account, lack of documents to open an account and distance to financial institutions.The McKinsey 2015 report, titled &acirc;&#128;&#152;The power of parity: How advancing women&acirc;&#128;&#153;s equality can add $12 trillion to global growth,&acirc;&#128;&#153; lists three elements that comprise financial inclusion: relative rates between women and men holding accounts, access to credit and access to mobile banking.Although mobile banking has led to more financial inclusion &acirc;&#128;&#148; at least 52 per cent of women in Kenya use mobile phones for transactions &acirc;&#128;&#148; more needs to be done.It is this myriad of challenges facing women, specifically those in business, that made the East African Women in Business Platform (EAWiBP) convene a conference on September 7 to discuss how women can improve their businesses and go big. It organised the forum in partnership with the Africa Women Agribusiness Network (Awan), the Association of Media Women in Kenya (Amwik) and communications firm Deer Leaps.HUSBANDS DIVERT MOBILE MONEYJennifer Riria, pioneer woman banker and CEO of Kenya Women Holding, says, &acirc;&#128;&#156;One of the biggest challenges we experience when trying to distribute loans to women in rural areas is that their husbands do not allow them to own phones. That means when money is sent through her husband&acirc;&#128;&#153;s phone, it never gets to her, and she is unable to start a small business and become self-reliant.&acirc;&#128;&#157;There are 39 banks, 13 microfinances, 16 nonbank institutions, two mortgage firms and one post bank in Kenya, but many women in rural areas do not have an account in any of these facilities.Riria says it is high time more women participate in the democratic space to push for inclusion. &acirc;&#128;&#156;That is why I&acirc;&#128;&#153;m working on establishing a Democracy Fund that will be my final contribution to the banking space. You cannot be seen or heard unless you are in the democratic space. Making money is fine, but to truly be heard, you need to be in the democratic space.&acirc;&#128;&#157;Riria says the fund will be a contributory one. It will help women interested in running for office save enough to run strong campaigns.IGNORANCE OR BEREAUCRACY?Although there are many challenges in accessing funds, many women are unaware of the avenues through which they can connect and get support both from the government and intergovernmental institutions.It is this lack of awareness, perhaps, what led to the low uptake of cash through the affirmative action funds?&acirc;&#128;&#156;Women keep asking for funds, but the funds are lying idle in our accounts. Women are not taking up the cash,&acirc;&#128;&#157; Women Enterprise Fund official Okoth Ogundo says.But some women complain of bureaucracy when trying to access funds. Farmer Winnie Wangui says, &acirc;&#128;&#156;I visited the WEF offices in my constituency many times and I was taken round in circles, until I gave up on accessing the funds.&acirc;&#128;&#157;The WEF is a semi-autonomous government agency in the Public Service ministry. It provides credit to support women start and expand businesses. The services include loans and LPO financing.STRENGTH IN NUMBERSNancy Gitonga, the regional coordinator of the EAWiPB, says women need to come together to share their knowledge and experiences when trying to access funds and business opportunities.She said women miss out on opportunities because they keep their businesses small and shy away from joining associations where they can connect with other businesswomen and get information on expanding their markets.EAWiBP brings together businesswomen from across the East African Community to promote their socioeconomic advancement.Gitonga gives an analogy of a person who uses a bike compared with one who boards a plane to reach their destination.&acirc;&#128;&#156;Doing business alone is like riding a bicycle. It will take you forever to reach your destination and when you get to a hill, you are the one who will be carrying the bicycle. Using a saloon car is a little better, but you can only include five people, most likely your family and friends. A bus is better, but a plane will get you to your destination fast and you will get to meet many people from many walks of life. That is what it is like to join an association with other businesspeople.&acirc;&#128;&#157;Gitonga says opportunities abound for women, but financial inclusion is not handed on a silver platter, it has to be seized.&acirc;&#128;&#156;There are women who give up when someone dismisses them and their business. You have to be bold and confident. Make people uncomfortable until they listen to you.&acirc;&#128;&#157;Gitonga says some women shy away from doing the hard work then complain about lack of opportunities.&acirc;&#128;&#156;Whenever the EAWiBP hears about business opportunities, we tell women on our platforms about them and they show interest, but as soon as we ask them to forward their technical proposals, few respond, and we find ourselves giving the opportunities to men, who sometimes are less qualified.&acirc;&#128;&#157;Another problem Gitonga has witnessed is some women taking business too casually.&acirc;&#128;&#156;I am based in Tanzania and a common complaint is that Kenyans try to be &acirc;&#128;&#152;smart&acirc;&#128;&#153; in business. The tricks people pull in Kenya will land you in jail in other East African countries.&acirc;&#128;&#157;She continues, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Integrity is key. If you are supposed to deliver a cheque to your supplier on Friday, do so. Some people are nowhere to be found once goods are delivered. It is better to let your supplier know you are encountering difficulties and renegotiate a payment plan than to go quiet.&acirc;&#128;&#157;SELF-UNDERESTIMATIONBusinesswoman and Benchmark Solutions CEO Laura Akunga says one major problem she has noticed with businesswomen, especially those starting out, is that they look down on themselves.&acirc;&#128;&#156;I talk to some businesswomen and some will say: &acirc;&#128;&#152;I run a &acirc;&#128;&#152;ka&acirc;&#128;&#153;small business on Thika Road. Women should be confident about their businesses and what they have to offer. In the Bible, God asked Moses what he had to lead the people out of Egypt and he said nothing. But God reminded him he had a stick. God can lift you with the &acirc;&#128;&#152;little&acirc;&#128;&#153; you have, so don&acirc;&#128;&#153;t undermine it.&acirc;&#128;&#157;There is progress in the financial inclusion of women, but more needs to be done. Women need to stand up, or as Sheryl Sandberg (Facebook&acirc;&#128;&#153;s chief operating officer and author of Lean In) said, take their seats at the table.
