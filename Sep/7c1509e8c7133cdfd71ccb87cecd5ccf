SportPesa Super 8 defending champions Kayole Asubuhi FC head coach Isaiah Omondi has tipped his side to finish in the medal bracket despite watching his charges play to a barren draw away against Meltah Kabiria at BP Riruta grounds, Kawangware over the weekend. The holders, who finished the match with 10-men after Angola Melchezidek’s second caution in the second half, remained  fifth with 46 points, 10 shy of leaders Kawangaware United. “It was fair game but we had some challenges which I believe we will need to overcome in the upcoming matches,” said Omondi. “Right now the league is very competitive, if you look at our last two games we were not as convincing as we should be but we are pushing everyone in the team to give his all. I cannot say we are under pressure but we have to be realistic if it comes to the worst, a top three would be fine for us.” Kiambiu Youth’s demotion fears persisted as they were humbled 2-1 at home by Jericho FC at Jericho grounds. Orneal Omondi and David Aswani struck a goal each on the 22nd and 69th minutes respectively to hand Jericho a 2-0 lead before Zeppaline  Andefua pulled one back for the visitors. At Ngong Posta grounds, relegation bound Ole Rongai FC suffered another defeat after being spanked 4-1 by second-placed NYSA. Away at  Ziwani grounds, a 20th minute strike by Stephen Odhiambo was all TUK FC needed to shove aside under-performing Shauri Moyo Blue Stars. Despite bagging the three points, the university students remain unmoved at 6th place but with an improved 44 points tally while Blue Stars are 12th with 25 points.
