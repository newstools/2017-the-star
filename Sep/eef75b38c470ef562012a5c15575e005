A union has withdrawn its suit that sought to stop IEBC from sacking CEO Ezra Chiloba and several secretariat officials. The union of independent commission workers wanted the court to stop the electoral commission's bosses from taking any form of disciplinary action against the officials. It named Immaculate Kassait, James Muhati, Betty Nyabuto, Praxides Tororey and Moses Kipkogey as some the officials they want spared in the purge.

In a letter by Ndegwa and Associates on Wednesday, the union apologised, representatives saying they only acted in the interest of workers. "My chambers unreservedly apologises to all your clients for any unintended adverse consequences that resulted from the said suit," the union said. "Notice of withdrawal has been duly filed and served upon the IEBC. In the spirit of resolution we trust that this matter can be considered closed." Chiloba and the other officials were sidelined in changes made at the secretariat ahead of the October 17 election. IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati said heads will roll at the poll agency following the nullification of President Uhuru Kenyatta's win in the August 8 vote. Chebukati made the changes when he constituted a new team to oversee the repeat election. Also read: Crisis as 4 IEBC commissioners defend Chiloba
