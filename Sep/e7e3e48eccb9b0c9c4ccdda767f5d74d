IEBC commissioners are said to be headed for a retreat at the weekend to solve the in-house wars.The retreat to be held at an undisclosed location comes in the wake of a damning memo by commission chair Wafula Chebukati to CEO Ezra Chiloba.Its contents seemed to split commission and secretariat members as some rallied to defend Chiloba.A top manager at the commission told The Star they cannot disclose the location due to security."We are going through a difficult time and we need some time to reflect on what has happened through out the week. We do not want to be bothered by politicians that is why we are keeping it to ourselves," the source said.Read: Chebukati&rsquo;s 12 questions for Chiloba excite NASAThe source said the retreat will play a key role in unifying the commissioners and help them forge a concrete way forward to deliver a free and credible presidential election on October 17.The heads of secretariat are also expected to attend the retreat.After the Supreme Court ruling that nullified President Uhuru Kenyatta's re-election, Chebukati said he would take action against commissioners found to have interfered with the election.NASA issued a statement saying they would not participate in repeat polls until the body is reconstituted, and asked for Chiloba's removal.Chebukati excluded the CEO from the team constituted for the October repeat polls and appointed new members to the secretariat.Jubilee then protested the move saying they had credible information that nine members are partisan.A lobby group moved to court on Thursday seeking orders to block IEBC from taking a disciplinary action against Chiloba.Chiloba has though since moved to court seeking an apology and his name removed from the case.A few hours later, Chebukati's memo to Chiloba leaked. The document demanded explanations of 12 key issues related to the August election.To Chebukati these 12 pertinent issues were key to the court ruling invalidating presidential election results.For instance the chairman wanted the CEO to explain why he authorized creation of a separate user account on the name of the chairman without his knowledge and consent.He said on the account over 9,934 transactions were conducted and thus put Ezra to task top explain.He also explain why 10,366 polling stations out on 40,883 submitted results without attaching form 34A's.More on this: Chebukati demands answers from Chiloba as IEBC election fallout deepensFive commissioners rejected the memo, saying Chebukati acted on his own volition and did not consult the plenary.The statement was issued initially by vice chair Consolata Nkatha and commissioners Yakub Guliye, Paul Kurgat, Boya Molu and Margaret Mwanchanya."Most of the issues are not factual and could easily mislead if taken out of context. The Secretariat is reviewing the issues and will prepare appropriate responsesHowever, about an hour later, Paul Kurgat distanced himself from the statement saying he was not consulted or briefed on the statement attributed to IEBC commissioners and sent to the news rooms.Notably missing from the statement was commissioner Roselyne Akombe.Read: IEBC commissioners reject damning Chebukati memo
