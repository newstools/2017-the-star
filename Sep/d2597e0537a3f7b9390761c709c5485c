A teachers' union official has demanded that polling stations in schools be relocated to the nearest public institutions. KNUN Thika branch secretary general Joe Ngige noted administrations incurred large costs fixing equipment destroyed during the August 8 general election. Ngige further argued that vote casting for the presidential race could end by midday on October 26, considering polling stations were closed at 5pm when Kenyans votes for all other posts. President Uhuru Kenyatta will battle it out again with NASA principal Raila Odinga as the Supreme nullified his victory in last month's election over irregularities. "IEBC should relocate the stations so schools are protected," Ngige told the press on Tuesday. The official also asked the President to ensure all learning institutions are guarded as security agents are likely to focus more on the election. He said they support Education CS Fred Matiang'i's decision for students to  break for holidays on October 24 to pave way for the election. But he noted KCPE and KCSE candidates need serene environments for preparation. Matiang'i said form four students will remain in school to prepare for the tests. All primary schools will have been closed by October 26 since most of them are gazetted polling stations. More on this: Students to break for holidays on October 24 ahead of election
