Two men who caused a stir in Bamburi-masters last week will return to court
today for their medical report. Musa Ongumu and Patrick Omondi stripped and dance naked after allegedly 'being found with a stolen car". They are
expected to be charged with being in possession of a stolen vehicle or
handling stolen goods. Last week, senior principal magistrate
Diana Mochache ordered the two be taken for mental assessment. In court, they
appeared absent minded and did seem not to be aware of what was
happening. However, two people who were involved in
the saga said they are the only ones who could heal
them. Ugandan Yassin
Lekorobe, 19,Â  and Ronald Nganga said doctors could not heal them. Lekorobe and Nganga were charged with
claiming ownership of a cobra that they used
for witchcraft without permit from Kenya wildlife services. Lekorobe was further charged with
unlawfully being in Kenya without a permit. They denied the charges and were
remanded at Shimo la Tewa Prison. The state objected their
release on bond, citing interference of witnesses. The fifth accused in the saga, which
has turned out to be a well-organised drama, is also expected to be
sentenced after pleading guilty to giving false information. Elizabeth Wetaba, who had alleged her car was stolen
and recovered by the witch doctors, denied that it belongs to her. She had claimed that she had lost the car for three days. The prosecution said they might prefer more charges depending on the outcome of the investigations.
