King of Genge, Juacali, turned a year older yesterday, as he celebrated the great milestone with his fellow colleagues, family and friends. One thing that seems to shock many is the fact that this ninja doesn't seem to age a single bit, even after turning 37 years. His colleagues at Calif Records threw him a beautiful birthday, gifting him a massive cake with a big headphone decoration at the top. Speaking exclusively to Word Is, Jua Cali said he was surprised by his wife and colleagues and was happy to celebrate his 37th birthday with the people he loves the most. "My wife bought me a watch and I really appreciate it. At the moment, I'm looking forward to meeting my child as we are expecting another member of the family. I won't reveal the sex of the baby, but maybe later on," Jua Cali said.
