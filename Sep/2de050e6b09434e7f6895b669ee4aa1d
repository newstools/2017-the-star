Matatu operators are opposed to the county&acirc;&#128;&#153;s directive to redesignate matatu termini and ban PSVs from the central business district.It was to take effect tomorrow, but Governor Mike Sonko postponed implementation for a month.During a meeting with the operators yesterday at Charter Hall, Sonko agreed to suspend the ban for a month.Sonko set strict conditions, including compliance with all law.Otherwise, PSVs will be removed from the CBD.Sonko warned against double parking, making U-turns at undesignated points and noise pollution.&acirc;&#128;&#156;The ball is in your court. Either we work together or perish together. Nairobi is a capital city and people have a lot of expectations of me,&acirc;&#128;&#157; he said at the meeting.&acirc;&#128;&#156;Others have already said Nairobi will become a slum and you must help me do what is expected,&acirc;&#128;&#157; Sonko said.Matatu owners proposed to be allocated parking for three to four vehicles for each sacco in the CBD. They want holding grounds outside the CBD where they can park their matatus and call for them when those in the CBD have left after picking passengers.But Sonko gave specific points where they will drop and pick passengers near the CBD and leave.Operators have called the ban untimely and too hasty.No permit for matatus in cbdThe county government on Friday announced that no matatus will be allowed to access the CBD from September 20.Matatus will only be allowed at Railways and Bus Station termini, and other designated areas outside the CBD. All licences issued to various PSV saccos to operate from the CBD were cancelled through a circular.The aim is to decongest the city that grapples with huge traffic jams.PSVs that use Waiyaki Way, Uhuru Highway, Kipande and Limuru roads to the CBD will drop and pick passengers at Fig Tree-terminus stage (Terminal A) in Ngara.Those plying Thika Road, including those from Kiambu and Ruiru, will drop and pick their passengers at Ngara Terminal B.Implement directive graduallyBut Matatu Welfare Association chairman Dickson Mbugua said the move will hurt most of their 200,000 members. He said the matatu crews were not consulted before reaching the decision that will drive most of them out of business.Mbugua said although MWA supports efforts to decongest the city, the operators of the 16,000 vehicles should have been consulted.&acirc;&#128;&#156;We are not opposing the move but we want to be consulted deeply on how to decongest the city. [Governor Mike] Sonko and his people can&acirc;&#128;&#153;t do it alone,&acirc;&#128;&#157; he said.&acirc;&#128;&#156;They did not inform or consult us and we feel they want to put our 14,000 14-seater matatus out of business.&acirc;&#128;&#157;Mbugua said the decongestion should be done gradually because any rush will hurt the industry.&acirc;&#128;&#156;This chest-thumping and name-calling will not help. We are also stakeholders and we wish the city well because we are also affected by the congestion. But no one can do it [decongestion] alone,&acirc;&#128;&#157; he said.MWA officials met yesterday.The operators disowned Matatu Owners Association chairman Simon Kimutai and Matatu Welfare Association&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Mbugua, who said they were considering calling a strike.
