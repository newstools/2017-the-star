A procurement officer in Nandi county who committed suicide last week had Sh36 million in his  accounts. The deceased, Kevin Kemboi, according to county sources investigating the disappearance of billions siphoned in factious payments, ordered for the freezing of the money under his name. The money is being held in various commercial banks in various towns across the country. Kemboi,32 is said  to have expressed fears over his life after he was rebuked by a chief officer over a leaked memo he had allegedly authored. He also had recorded a conversation, in which he was given a dressing down after he questioned the whereabouts of five local purchase orders that had been presented for payments. He had been put under the radar of auditors and he was unable to access his millions, after a caveat was issued by the county. Family member David Ng’etich  said the deceased had asked  to meet him to discuss threats on his life by his colleagues. Kemboi had previously served as a procurement officer at the Ministry of Health in Kapsabet and was moved to the Water docket after Sh240m disappeared a year ago.
