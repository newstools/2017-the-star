There were celebrations in NASA leader Raila Odinga&rsquo;s Bondo rural home, following the Supreme Court that nullified President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s election.Carrying twigs and placards, and dancing, jubilant residents blocked the Kisumu-Busia highway.The two major highways on the Kisumu-Busia-Kisumu-Bondo were jammed for the better part of the afternoon.This created a major traffic snarl-up.Motorists, who were caught unawares, following the Supreme Court judges&rsquo;s ruling, had to drive slowly behind the crowd.In Bondo, the public cheered as they sang and danced heading to Raila&rsquo;s rural home, saying the home was the "State House in waiting".Armed, hawk-eyed police officers watched from a distance as overzealous youths provoked and taunted them.Former Siaya county council chairman Aggrey Onyango could not hide his joy, saying the court has considered the will of the majority of Kenyans.
