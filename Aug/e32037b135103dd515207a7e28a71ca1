A teacher from Apokor Secondary School in Teso South constituency committed suicide on Sunday. He left a suicide note that read, “ Dear Mum, I know you love me very much,  but I don’t want  to see you going through  more embarrassment from me. You have spent so much to educate me, but all I had to pay you with is embarrassment. I have decided to end my life so that I have peace. Goodbye” The man listed his assets, including Sh3,000 in his M-Pesa  and cash in the bank. OCPD Paul Odede told the Star on the phone that the deceased’s parents raised the alarm after finding him hanging from a rafter in a house he had rented in the Simba Chai area. “The parents had decided to look for him after he disappeared, only to find him hanging on a rope, it is very unfortunate.” he said. The deceased’s mother had questioned him about impregnating a student.
