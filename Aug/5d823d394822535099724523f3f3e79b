Kilifi County Jubilee candidate Gideon Mung’aro has said he was certain of winning the governor seat on Tuesday. He said the incumbent Amason Kingi had failed to deliver and that the residents are ready to support him. Speaking at his home-turf in Dabaso and Jimba, the Kilifi North MP dismissed opinion polls that showed Kingi leading in the race. He said Kingi had hired pollster company to show he was the front runner but told him to prepare his exit from office as the people will overwhelmingly vote for him. Mung’aro alleged that there were over 4000 ghost workers in the county. Mung’aro said he commands support in Kaloleni, Ganze, Magarini, Kilifi South, Kilifi North, Rabai and Malindi. “Kingi won’t defeat me even at his own backyard, Magarini, do not waste your votes to vote for him as he is going home,’’ he said. He said in the first 100 days after being elected governor he shall ensure ‘Kingi’s home has a shower.’ “The governor has failed even to give water to his own people, even at his home.’’ he said.

The legislator also dismissed claims that he was involved in the controversial Chembe Kibabamuche land grabbing scandal. He said the purported pieces of prime properties had been grabbed by foreign tycoons and belonged to locals. “I came in to help the poor locals who had lost their properties from their grabbers, ask anybody in Chembe Kibabamuche if I grabbed any of their lands,’’ he said.
