Governor Alfred Mutua has performed "radical surgery" and suspended more than 437 Machakos employees in the finance sector, a day after his inauguration. The workers including procurement officers, accountants and auditors were sent home on Friday to allow an audit. Mutua said the affected are from the county treasury headquarters and those seconded in government departments all over the county. "This move is to allow a thorough independent audit and suitability assessment of staff, financial systems and operations for Machakos," he said in a statement. "They should proceed on immediate leave from today until further notice. They are not to access government premises until they are recalled." He added the move will ensure the people get value for their money from now on. "There is need to improve efficiency, route out cartels and enhance accountability and integrity in all levels of my government." More changes will follow in the next few days, the Governor said, adding the process is part of a "comprehensive radical surgery" informed by his interactions with residents. "I promise my people and stakeholders that I will ensure you receive government services in a transparent and efficient manner." At the inauguration on Thursday, elected leaders promised to work with Mutua for residents' benefit. Wiper MPs Patrick Makau (Mavoko), Robert Mbui (Kathiani), Stephen Mule (Matungulu) and Joshua Mbithi (Masinga) all snubbed the ceremony.
