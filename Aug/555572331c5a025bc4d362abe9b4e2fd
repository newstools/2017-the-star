It was Nigerian academic and author Babafemi Badejo who described Opposition Chief Raila Odinga in his biography as an enigma in Kenya politics. And sure, Agwambo's political life has been mysterious. Written off after three failed attempt at the presidency, Raila has each time bounced back, assembling a lethal campaign machinery and missing the ultimate price by a whisker. At 72, the veteran politician cuts the figure of a hardened war general.His supporters follow him with a cultic commitment, giving him the solid backing often reflected in huge and passionate political gatherings. An astute politician and avid campaigner known to move crowds using parables and football commentary, Raila has over the years fashioned himself as a reformer.His anti-corruption, human rights crusade as well as push for more devolution of power and resources have endeared him to many especially the marginalised.Raila terms NASA, the Coalition of the Constitution and has made zero tolerance to graft a central theme in his entire campaign.In his manifesto, Raila says that the culture of impunity will end on day one if he steps into State House.In a rare endorsement, renowned Constitutional Lawyer Yash Ghai has urged Kenyans to elect Raila to end what he described as status quo and usher in justice and equality.&ldquo;Voters should cast their votes for Raila Odinga, if we are to maintain democracy, human rights, the rule of law, separation of powers, social justice and equity, and the promotion of national unity as required by the Constitution,&rdquo;Ghai wrote in the Standard on Sunday.Ironically, its Raila's open defiance and fiery oratory on the political stage that has also scared many. Raila's critics depict him as a socialist, power hungry politician who would do anything to be President.Today, the ODM leader faces an acid test in what is probably his last stab at the country's top job. He will face off with President Uhuru Kenyatta in what is seen as the grand rematch in a dynastic political rivalry between the two families.Raila's dad, Jaramogi Oginga Odinga differed with Jomo Kenyatta, Kenyan first President shortly after independence, turning into a fierce generational political rivalry.Raila entered parliament in 1992 after spending much of the previous decade jailed or in exile during the struggle for democracy.He vied for the presidency in 1997, 2007 and 2013, claiming to have been cheated in the last two votes.Many observers agree Raila's 2007 electoral victory was stolen from him.Raila studied Engineering in East Germany. On his return to Kenyahe worked as a lecturer, before being detained in 1982 for alleged involvement in a failed coup attempt against the then president, Daniel arap Moi.He spent six years in jail without trial, and later was arrested twice more for pressing for an end to one-party rule.In one of his rarely told stories, Raila once gave a vivid description of how he used a battered, leaking boat to escape to Uganda through Lake Victoria with security agents in hot pursuit.So sophisticated is Raila&rsquo;s political life that even some of his allies rarely understand him.In excerpts from Raila&rsquo;s autography &ndash;Raila Odinga: An Enigma in Kenyan Politics, former Gem MP Joe Donde describes Raila as a double-faced politician.&ldquo;Raila is a double-faced human being that is difficult to understand. As Wamalwa (Kijana) used to say, if you talk to Raila, you have to know what Amolo is thinking and yet it is the same person. Knowing Raila from the 1950s, it is safe to say that what he says is not what he does on the ground.&rdquo;
