Kitui residents are set for a down-to-earth, accessible and open-minded administration based on Governor-elect Charity Ngilu’s promises. Ngilu beat Governor Julius Malombe and Senator David Musila. She got 167,765 votes, Musila got 113,300, while Malombe had 74,044. On Monday Ngilu said, “All residents, whether, donning sandals or barefooted, even those with dirty clothing, have free access to the governor’s office. It is an office that without discrimination belongs to everyone. She spoke during thanksgiving prayers. “Workers must shun the attitude of being bosses and roll up their sleeves to serve the people of Kitui to their expectation. We must stop being bosses but servants of the people,” Ngilu said.
