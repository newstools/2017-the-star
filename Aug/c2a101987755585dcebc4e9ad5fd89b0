The Lamu government is working to ensure proper land demarcation and use, by setting aside residential land for farming and industries. Governor Fahim Twaha (pictured) said his focus is to ensure proper land use to reduce conflicts and increase productivity. Speaking in Lamu on Sunday, he said the new land use plan will include parcels for establishing modern towns. The governor also pledged to ensure squatters in the county are resettled and given title deeds so they can live comfortable and productive lives. He said every Lamu resident has the right to live anywhere they wish. Residents whose land was acquired for the coal and wind plantsÂ  have urged Twaha to push for their compensation.
