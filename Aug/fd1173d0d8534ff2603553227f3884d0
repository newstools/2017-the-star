KBC workers have downed their tools in a push for the government to increase their salaries. The strike came less than a week to the general election which will take place on August 8. The Kenya Broadcasting Corporation workers said on Wednesday that they took the step after management failed to implement their quest. They signed a Collective Bargaining Agreement  last month. Benson Okwaro, Communication Workers Union secretary general, led the workers in the protest at KBC headquarters in Nairobi. They are demanding a 13.5 per cent salary increment from July 2017 following the June 14 strike notice. "After talks failed, we resorted to demonstrating so our plea is heard." Okwaro said the proposed increment was discussed by the East Africa Community, Labour and Social Protection ministry after COWU threatened to call a strike. But management at the media house said they are awaiting formal communication from the Salaries and Remuneration Commission. "KBC is a state agency [so it is] bound by all laws and rules governing state bodies," managing director Waithaka Waihenya noted. "The corporation, therefore, cannot sign or implement any CBA without the approval of the SRC. As soon as that is obtained, the CBA will be signed forthwith."
