Confusion and delays marked yesterday's General Election even as the polls agency assured all was well.In Kariokor, police fired teargas to disperse voters who had turned chaotic following confusion over polling stations and missing names.And at some polling stations, election materials arrived hours after the official 6am and some election kits failed temporarily at Pumwani Girls' polling station temporarily, putting the election on hold.Reports indicated some kits did not work, but Maina said they were replaced."Every polling station has two extra kits and our ICT officers are moving around to ensure they are working," she said.In Moi Avenue Primary School polling station, 24 people were injured in a dawn stampede and were treated for minor injuries. IEBC vice chairperson Consolata Maina said one of them was treated at Nairobi Hospital, while 23 others were treated at Kenyatta National Hospital and discharged. She said they were injured as voters pushed through the gate, shortly after it was opened at 5.45am."People had queued for long before our officials arrived. When the gate was opened, they got in and some were tramped on," Maina said.She said calm was restored and voting went on going smoothly."Chaos started when people could not identify their stations. When some began walking around to confirm where they are supposed to queue, others thought they were jumping the queue. Police were unable to control them," Maina said.Earlier, the IEBC dismissed a clerk for stamping ballot papers as rejected and replaced polling agents for causing delays in Westlands, Embakasi East and Kasarani.In Mathare, there was a temporary delay caused by a slight error in printing MCA ballot papers.But area MP commander Kiprono Langat said the MCA aspirants agreed on how to resolve the hitch with the IEBC officials and the voting proceeded.In Kariokor polling station, delays was caused by disorganisation and perceived lack of preparedness."The IEBC did not make adequate preparations for the big turnout. They have set up very few tents and there is lack of space in polling stations," Elijah Mbungua said at Kariokor polling station.Some voters did not find their names at polling stations they registered.Others complained of a slow voting exercise. "I came here at 4.30am. I'm yet to vote although the polling station was opened at 6am, a voter at Ngei AIPCA Church polling station in Huruma ward said.
