The return of Cherangany MP-elect Joshua Kutuny to Parliament and  the reelection of Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter and Kapseret’s Oscar Sudi give them an advantage in regional and national politics. Kutuny lost his seat in 2013 and since then has been serving as President Uhuru Kenyatta’s political adviser. During campaigns he coined the slogan ‘Heshimu Raiya (Respect the Ordinary People)’, which caught on and helped him win. “I am proud of Cherangany people for electing me and I assure them I will keep all my pledges and ensure we work together as communities,” Kutuny told the Star. He said he will focus on non-controversial issues and unite all communities in Trans Nzoia and other parts of the country.  Government’s eye Out of all the political leaders elected in Trans Nzoia, Kutuny is closest to Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto. He is likely to be the ‘government’s eye’ in the largely cosmopolitan county. Kutuny, Keter and Sudi are hugely popular with the youth. They are expected to play a major role in Ruto’s 2022 presidential bid. In the run-up to the election, Keter and Sudi said once they were elected they would ensure Ruto’s bid succeeds. “Some people are scheming so that we lose our seats because they know that if are reelected we will ensure that Ruto wins the presidency in 2022,” Sudi said at a campaign meeting in Eldoret. Kutuny said he will play mature politics devoid of tribalism. “Politics has taught me that you should not play with the ordinary people. They are our employers and once they decide, you cannot fight them,” he said. All three are close allies of Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago.
