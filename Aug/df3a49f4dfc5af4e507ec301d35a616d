The proposed Treasury Single Account (TSA) will see both national and county governments better plan their cash flows and reduce unnecessary borrowing, Britam Asset managers have projected.Currently, national and county revenue generating entities operate multiple bank accounts, making it difficult for the treasury to establish a clear picture of its liquidity flow.This has led to scenarios where government entities with idle cash in accounts still receive budgetary allocations, sometimes forcing the treasury to borrow to meet immediate obligations.According to Britam Asset Managers Limited, the single treasury account will also form a central revenue collection point for the governments, effectively enabling them to generate up to date financial statements, increasing accountability in the public space.In January, Parliament proposed the Finance Bill 2017 that could have seen all government deposits placed in banks where the state has more than 20 per cent ownership.This could have seen the government banking with only five institutions in the country: National Bank, KCB, Consolidated Bank, Development Bank and Post Office Savings Bank. However, this section was removed, making way for the public Finance Management Bill 2017 gazetted in June. If the bill is passed in its current state, all government revenues will be passed through the revenue collection account, credited to the exchequer account from which outflows will be managed, upgrading the current Integrated Financial Management Information Systems (IFMIS) where all government transactions are conducted.This will make Kenya the second country in Sub Saharan Africa to adopt TSA after Nigeria introduced the system in 2012.Last week, the Nigerian Treasury revealed that the initiative is saving the government at least $12.8 million (Sh1.28 billion) per month in banks charges, including loan interests.Last year, the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission revealed that Kenya loses up to $6 billion (Sh600 billion), a third of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP), to corruption. In December last year, Auditor-General Edward Ouko said that 24 county governments were unable to account for Sh140 billions.Even though the bill means well especially for Kenyan taxpayers who have in the past lost billions of shillings to corrupt state officials due to poor financial management system, Britam Asset Managers are concerned that the shift to TSA is likely to affect some banks&rsquo; deposit profile.
