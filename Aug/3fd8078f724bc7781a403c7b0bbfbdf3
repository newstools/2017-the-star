The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission yesterday dismissed reports that some 800,000 voters cast ballots for presidential candidates alone. The commission was responding to a story by the Star indicating that this number of eligible voters ignored other positions. Speaking to the Star on the phone, CEO Ezra Chiloba said the inconsistencies resulted from delays in results transmission from polling stations. He said in some areas, the transmission rate was "bottom low" and should not be confused with the final count. Chiloba cited Embu and Kirinyaga counties, where he said the senator
results posted on the IEBC portal account for only 4.4 per cent of all
polling stations. The Star had used the figures on the portal to make the calculations but had not taken into account the transmission rate. In Embu, the portal had 200,201 more people for president than senator. This, however, was a reflection of 100 per cent polling stations for
president and a paltry 22.2 per cent transmission rate for senator. Chiloba said the commission does not anticipate any major variance
between the presidential vote and votes cast for other candidates after
100 per cent transmission from polling centres. He said the delay in transmission might have been occasioned by KIEMS dadgets that malfunctioned. â€œThere could be many reasons why they did not transmit the other results electronically. Maybe the kits did not function," Chiloba said. Results for some 33-34 elective positions, he added, were not
transmitted because some candidates were cleared by courts after the
system had been set. However, the IEBC portal has results from Muhoroni constituency,
despite the area being one of those whose candidates were changed at the
last minute through a court order.
