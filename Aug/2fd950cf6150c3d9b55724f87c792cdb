Kenya&rsquo;s Olympic champion Eliud Kipchoge and former world record holder Wilson Kipsang will have Ethiopia&rsquo;s Kenenisa Bekele to contend with as the Berlin Marathon organisers assemble the top three marathoners for a world record-breaking contest on September 24.Kipchoge&rsquo;s avowed intention is to break compatriot Dennis Kimetto&rsquo;s time, which the latter achieved in Berlin in 2014 with his time of 2:02:57. Kichoge had a kind of &lsquo;lab test&rsquo; at the beginning of May when he ran 2:00:25, the fastest time ever for the marathon distance, on the Formula One circuit of Monza in Italy. But this feat was achieved with the help of a team of substitute pacemakers who also formed a wind shield from start to finish.Under normal race conditions a maximum of three pacemakers is permitted and no substitutes are allowed. Kipchoge later commented: &ldquo;In Monza I was so close to breaking the two-hour barrier. The Berlin Marathon represents the right opportunity for me to attack the official world record.&rdquo; At the age of 32 Kipchoge can look back on a long and successful career as a long distance runner.He won the world 5,000m title in 2003, silver and bronze medals at the Olympic Games over the same distance in 2004 and 2008 respectively and is the reigning Olympic Marathon champion, thanks to his victory in Rio in 2016.The greatest day in the 35-year-old Kipsang&rsquo;s career so far was four years ago during the 40th edition of the Berlin Marathon when he took 15 seconds off the world record of his compatriot Patrick Makau&rsquo;s time of 2:03:38. But Kipsang&rsquo;s record of 2:03:23 stood as the world record for just 12 months as Kimetto became the first man to run the distance under three hours on Berlin&rsquo;s renowned fast course. In 2016 Kipsang ran 10 seconds faster than his world record in Berlin but it was only good enough for second place behind Bekele. The Ethiopian set a personal best of 2:03:03 in winning the title and missed the world record by a mere six seconds. Kipsang had pushed the pace during the second half of the race and didn&rsquo;t have the strength to counter the fast-finishing Ethiopian over the last two kilometres. But last year&rsquo;s race left Wilson Kipsang with the conviction that he still had another very fast marathon in his legs and he wants to prove that: &ldquo;I am highly motivated and my preparation has been more meticulous than ever.&rdquo;Bekele, 35, is the most successful long distance track runner in history. Three times Olympic champion and World champion on five occasions at 5,000m and 10,000m, he has also won 11 World Cross Country titles over the short and long distances. For good measure, he also holds the world records for 5000m and 10,000m.September 24 will be his eighth marathon following his winning debut in Paris with 2:05:04, then Chicago (4th in 2:05:51), a dnf in Dubai in 2015, London in 2016 (3rd in 2:06:36), Berlin 2016 (1st in 2:03:03), another dnf in Dubai 2017 and London (2nd in 2:05:57) in 2017. Many experts consider Bekele&rsquo;s achievements in the long distances have earned him the distinction of being the greatest all-rounder of all time.
