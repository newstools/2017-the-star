ODM’s Budalang’i MP-elect Raphael Wanjala (pictured) has thanked voters for electing him and pledged to provide equal development opportunities to transform their lives. Speaking to the Star on the phone on Tuesday, he said the dormant rice drier in Nadero village, Ruambwa, will be turned into a health centre to save residents from trekking long distances in search of treatment in neighbouring Siaya county. Budalang’i is in Busia county. Residents had appealed for leaders to turn the abandoned facility into a health centre. “We are pleased with the decision of our new MP to transform the rice drier into a health centre because the facility is too far from the Ruambwa-Mudembi rice farms and the farmers cannot manage to transport rice to drier regions due to the high cost of transportation,” a rice farmer said.
