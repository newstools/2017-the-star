Lender Kenya Commercial Bank posted an after tax profit of Sh10.26 billion during the second quarter of the year, dropping marginally by 0.19 per cent from Sh10.28 billion during the same period last year. This was however a 55.75 per cent jump compared to net profit earned during the first quarter ending March recorded at Sh4.54 billion. The lender attributed the strong performance to improvements in its core retail and corporate business, non-interest income and lower interest expense. “The business fundamentals remain strong and we are optimistic of a stronger performance in the remaining part of the year,” KCB Group CEO Joshua Oigara said in a statement. During the period, loans and advances to customers rose 16.71 per cent to Sh406.98 billion in quarter-two from Sh348.69 the previous year. Net interest income increased by 2.89 per cent to Sh23.25 billion up from Sh22.50 billion last year. The group’s net non-performing loans for the April-July period declined by 38.67 per cent to Sh9.23 billion from Sh14.17 billion during the same period in 2016. Oigara said that the first half numbers indicated that non-branch channel systems such as Mbenki and KCB M-Pesa accounted for 86 per cent of the lender’s total transactions. “This strategy focuses on growing digital banking so as to enhance the experience of our esteemed customers whenever they interact with us and at the same time spread our network in KCB,” Oigara said. The bank is targeting to reach more than 15 million mobile banking customers and increase its agency network to over 20,000 agents.
