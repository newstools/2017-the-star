Nakuru Senator-elect Susan Kihika is keen at becoming the first woman Senate Speaker or Deputy Speaker, as lobbying intensifies for top parliamentary positions. Elected NASA and Jubilee lawmakers in the Senate and National Assembly are lobbying for the posts in the 12th Parliament, which is scheduled to convene next Tuesday. Kihika has expressed interest in the two seats and she is currently “studying the landscape” while waiting for “my party leaders’ decision”.  She said she is not lobbying but will wait for Jubilee Party leaders’ decision. “There is no one who has been tried and tested than I have been. I was tried by fire and I somehow managed. I survived to lead a successful assembly in the legislative work,” the former Nakuru assembly speaker told the Star on the phone. The Senate deputy speaker position is vacant as its holder, outgoing Murang’a Senator Kembi Gitura, lost to Irungu Kang’ata in the August 8 General Election. There is a push to replace Senate Speaker Ekwee Ethuro with either Kihika, former CIC chairman Charles Nyachae or outgoing Ainabkoi MP Samuel Chepkonga.
