Only 10 women were elected as MCAs in North Rift counties, but Nandi stands out for having voted in six. Baringo, Trans Nzoia, Uasin Gishu and West Pokot have only one elected woman MCA each, while Elgeyo Marakwet and Turkana have none. “I would have wished we have more women as elected as MCAs, but I’m happy that our county gave six of us a chance to serve in the assembly,” journalist Nancy Chemutai, who represents Kobujoi ward, said. Nandi women are also represented at the top after Governor Stephen Sang picked university professor Yulita Mitei as the deputy governor. Women in Uasin Gishu also achieved distinction after former Education minister Margaret Kamar was elected senator and Janet Rotich was elected independent MP for Turbo constituency.
