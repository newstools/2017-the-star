Diamond Platnumz seems to be making things official with baby mama Zarina Hassan. Zari flew to Tanzania from South Africa and immediately went to prepare herself for what many have termed as her big day. The Salome hit maker posted a photo of Zari's hand with a green ruby engagement ring that was proof enough that Baba Tiffah will be tying the knot with the love of his life, Zari. In a past interview with a Tanzanian radio station, The Boss Lady said that Diamond would be going to see her father this year to finalise things. She also said her dream wedding will make many jaws drop to the ground. Zari wants nothing short of a grand wedding. "We don't want a small wedding. Our wedding should be one of the biggest weddings East Africa has ever seen. Meaning the budget has to be big." Zari added, "This year, we are visiting my dad officially. Diamond is officially going to ask for his permission to marry me. He has been to my family a lot of times but now he is going officially. He wants to take that step this year." Their anticipated wedding comes days after Diamond fathered a child with his video vixen, Hamisa Mobetto â€”claims he has responded to in his song titled Fresh.
