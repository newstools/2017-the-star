Governor-elect Mike Sonko, woman representative-elect Esther Passaris and Starehe MP loser Boniface Mwangi have led the way in removing their campaign posters from City walls. Sonko’s rescue team started its cleanup on Tuesday. It traversed the CBD removing posters from walls and poles. In a tweet last week, Sonko said, “The cleaning campaign will continue until Nairobi is declared the cleanest city in Africa. I have ordered the dispatch of more than 50 trucks to immediately begin this process.” The Sonko Rescue Team will remove all candidates’ posters. Mwangi began the cleanup trend last Saturday. He and a group of volunteers traversed parts of Starehe constituency removing the posters. In a tweet, he said, “Spent my day clearing my campaign posters with a team of amazing people. I would like to thank each and every single one of them for joining us.” Twenty-three -year old Susan Silantoi, who vied for Nairobi senator, has also started removing her campaign posters.
