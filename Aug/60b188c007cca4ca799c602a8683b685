Kiambu Senator Kimani Wamatangi (pictured), one of only two in the Mt Kenya region to be reelected to the Upper House, says he will continue serving the people without being influenced. Speaking in Kiambu yesterday, Wamatangi, who faced opposition including from his Jubilee counterparts, garnered 727,092 votes. This made him the senator with the second-highest votes after Nairobi’s Johnson Sakaja, who garnered 817,388. Wamatangi said, “We need to move forward as a county in unison and serve the people who elected us. I will not fall short of that and will diligently represent the Kiambu people in the Senate by performing my oversight role.” He said the county government must be checked, as mandated by the Constitution and leaders elected must resolve residents’ issues. “We were elected to serve Kiambu people and they have raised issues and made recommendations and we should not veer away from this,” Wamatangi said. He continued, “Continued politicking among leaders denied locals access to services and we need to move to a new chapter from the previous leadership, focus on services and shun issues that will not benefit the people.” Wamatangi urged the Kiambu government to fast-track development projects. He said the county government has resources that should be used for the benefit of the people. “The county government is among those that get a good share of the national budget and the funds must be used wisely on projects that will benefit the people,” Wamatangi said. He said poverty and unemployment will reduce if the county invests in development.
