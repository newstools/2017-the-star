Homa Bay chief of protocol John Apollo is among the candidates who have expressed their interest in being the county assembly speaker. The seat has also attracted the Assembly Public Service Board chairperson Judy Kamaria and Luoland Dialogue Initiative chairman Odoyo Owidi. Apollo said he has all the qualities and experience to head the county’s legislative arm. In 2013, Apollo shelved his ambitions in support of Samuel Ochillo, the outgoing speaker. This came after a pre-election agreement by elected leaders that proposed that the speaker be reserved for a person from the Kasipul region. Apollo is from Suba. “I’m going for the seat this time round. Not that the current speaker has not performed, but I feel I would do it better,” he said. Owidi is banking on the support and advice he has been offering ODM through radio and TV talk shows. He is also from Kasipul and wants the 2013 pre-polls deal honoured.
