The voting patterns in Western region on Tuesday depict a paradigm shift by voters from blind party allegiance to supporting candidates as individuals, based on what they have to offer, analysts say. The Western region shared seats among parties. Musalia Mudavadi’s ANC was the biggest winner, getting 11 of the 33 seats followed by President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Jubilee Party, which bagged eight seats. Ford Kenya and ODM shared the rest. Political analyst Martin Oloo yesterday said the voting pattern was meant to strengthen Mudavadi as the Luhya spokesman. “People are running away from the mentality of being herded along party lines to assessing individuals’ capabilities to deliver before voting,” he said. ANC won Lugari, Lurambi, Khwisero, Butere, Matungu, Sabatia, Emuhaya, Vihiga, Webuye East, Teso North and Nambale constituencies. ANC also won the Vihiga Senate seat and was headed for victory in the Kakamega Senate race. Jubilee won eight seats - Ikolomani, Malava, Navakholo, Mumias East, Mt Elgon, Sirisia, Webuye West and Kimilili, while Ford Kenya won Hamisi, Kanduyi, Kabuchai and Tongareni constituencies. Oloo said that though NASA as a coalition won many seats, ODM was the biggest loser. ODM has been the dominant party in Western since its inception in 2005. Political analyst Frank Matanga said ANC received the majority of seats in the region because Mudavadi pleaded with voters to give him enough foot soldiers during his campaign. But Matanga of Masinde Muliro University said internal competition among NASA candidates worked in favour of Jubilee. “Voters were responding to this call to position Mudavadi for future political negotiations,” he said. Matanga continued, “It simply shows the people of Western ignored calls by some party leader to vote using the six-piece method. This is why there is one independent elected in Bungoma.”
