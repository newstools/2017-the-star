The search for the remaining bodies of a Lamu politician’s kin who died in the sea after their boat capsized last Sunday has been officially called off. Three more bodies are yet to be recovered. Speaking in Lamu on Tuesday, head of the search team Awadh Ali said they had been forced to call off the search after failing to locate the remaining bodies. The bodies are those of two of Kahale’s children aged two and 12 and that of his nephew aged 12 too. The accident happened at the Manda Bruno area after a speed boat carrying ODM’s Shekue Kahale, his wife, four children and six other relatives capsized and sank at 10.30am. They had been reported missing at sea by relatives after they failed to arrive at the Manda Airport, where they were to board a flight to Mombasa. Shekue, the only survivor, had just lost the Lamu East MP seat to Jubilee’s Athman Shariff when he met the tragic incident. All his children aged between 1-12 years and his wife perished alongside his aunt, his sister and her three children on the fateful day. Shekue was found by the search team on Majunguni, an uninhabited island close to Shanga Island in Lamu East, having swam the whole night for over eight hours. The search operation had been organised by the county administration and was being carried out by maritime and immigration police, the Navy and a team of local divers. The search, which has been on for over one week, has on many occasions been hindered by the heavy current normally experienced at the Manda Bruno, slowing down the exercise. So far all the nine bodies that were recovered have already been buried at cemeteries in Kizingitini and Lamu town as per the Muslim religion. The search was called off on Sunday after efforts to retrieve the remaining three bodied proved futile. But relatives said the situation would haunt them in the future.
