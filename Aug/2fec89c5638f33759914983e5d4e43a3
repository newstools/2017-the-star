Bomet Governor-elect Joyce Laboso has promised a raft of administrative changes and a ‘complete shift from the past’ in the management of the county upon her assumption of office next week. Laboso on Sunday said the EACC will be called in to conduct a forensic audit. She said she will clean the payroll and sack staff hired irregularly as part of a rationalisation programme. Laboso said the controversy over the construction of a university in Bomet town will be resolved. She said her administration will reach out to Moi University with an aim of setting up a town campus. Laboso said, “The case pending in court must be withdrawn immediately and I want to state here clearly that the costs incurred will not be paid from county funds but [outgoing Governor Isaac] Rutto personally.” Rutto’s administration went to court on several occasions disputing the location of the university. Laboso said a university will improve the county’s economy literacy levels among the youth. She said, “I want to assure you all that I will bring the desired change in the county and we will follow the law to the letter in implementing our agenda and executing our mandate.” Laboso continued, “Give us the time, space and support to undertake the changes desired by the people of this county who made their decision through the ballot. People voted for change and we shall give them nothing less.” She said she is focussed on development. “There will be no more leadership squabbles as have been witnessed in the county during the last five years,” Laboso said. She said she will include all stakeholders in development. “I am your governor. A governor for those who voted for me and those who did not vote for me. I am also Isaac Ruto’s governor as he belongs to this county,” Laboso said.
