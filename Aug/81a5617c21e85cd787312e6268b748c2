Team Kenya to the Africa Masters Championships may not honour the event due to lack of funds.Kenya was represented at the World Masters Championships in Australia last year, where they won 10 medals&mdash;three gold, four silver and three bronze.The team is expected to represent the country at this year&rsquo;s edition set for August 25-27 in Abidjan, Ivory Coast but their hopes are diminishing by the day since they have not received any financial support.According to the head of delegation, Rose Tata Muya, who also guided the team to Australia, they approached the Ministry of Sports for support but were instructed to get a letter from Athletics Kenya, who continue to play &lsquo;hide and seek&rsquo;.&ldquo;In our previous championships, the government through the Ministry of Sports and AK assisted us and we hope they will do the same this year,&rdquo; said Tata. She said they have severally tried to persuade AK for the letter but nothing has been forthcoming. &ldquo;Up to now, we have not received a letter from AK in order to present it to the Ministry of Sports for support and I don&rsquo;t understand why. For now, we don&rsquo;t know what to do because the team of about 15 athletes and officials are in training,&rdquo; she added.She said veterans deserve respect for being part of the Kenyan sports foundation and besides, they were a good platform to market Kenya. &ldquo;Our athletes have been taking part in the AK weekend meetings in search of fast times because we could not hold our own meeting due to lack of funds,&rdquo; she said.She is now appealing for well-wishers to intervene in order to honour the event, saying they require Sh4 million.
