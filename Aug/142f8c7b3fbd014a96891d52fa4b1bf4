Divisions within NASA cost the opposition alliance crucial seats at the Coast, Changamwe MP Omar Mwinyi has said. “The disadvantage we have in NASA is that we are competing amongst ourselves,” he said at his home in Port Reitz, Changamwe, yesterday. NASA lost to Jubilee in the Kwale governor race, where incumbent Salim Mvurya held a commanding lead over NASA’s Chirau Mwakwere (Wiper) and Issah Kipera (ODM) on Thursday. Mvurya won 111,483 votes, compared to Mwakwere’s 27,204 and Kipera’s 27,064. More than 93 per cent of the votes had been counted. In Lamu, Jubilee’s Fahim Twaha benefited from NASA’s three candidates who split their votes. Twaha was declared the winner with 22,969 votes. He defeated incumbent Issa Timamy (ANC) who had 22,420 votes, Wiper’s Swaleh Salim with 2,484 votes and ODM’s Abdalla Mohamed with 1,086 votes. Mwinyi spoke as he was about to be declared the winner after garnering 30,586 votes with 97 per cent of the votes counted by Thursday morning in the Changamwe MP race. He said NASA is the dominant coalition at the Coast, with ODM the party of choice for majority of residents. Mwinyi’s closest challenger, Jubilee’s Abdi Daib, had 9,651 votes, according to provisional results published by the IEBC.  Internal divisions in Nasa “If at all we failed to reach any seat, it is as a result of our own division amongst the NASA fraternity,” Mwinyi said. He spoke at his home in Port Reitz, where he was preparing to host a major celebration party in expectation of victory. Mwinyi said ODM has, or had, the capability of winning all seats in the region if it is more organised and works as a team. The objective of NASA was to bring hope to the people of Kenya, Mwinyi added. “We believe that given the chance,  Kenya will be a better country in the next few years if at all we manage to clinch the presidency,” he said.
