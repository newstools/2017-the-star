The rift between Laikipia governor aspirant Ndiritu Muriithi and Devolution CS Mwangi Kiunjuri is widening after the candidate accused the minister of urging residents to reject him. Muriithi yesterday said the CS is campaigning for incumbent Joshua Irungu on the Jubilee ticket. Muriithi is an independent. Irungu has been accused of being a NASA mole. A video of Irungu campaigning for NASA candidates in the area went viral. But the governor has rejected the clip as fake. During President Mwai Kibaki’s reign, Muriithi served as Industrialisation assistant minister and Kiunjuri his counterpart in the Energy ministry. Speaking to the press in Nyahururu town on Monday, Muriithi told the CS to concentrate on his ministerial duties and stop meddling in local politics. He said Kiunjuri has been distributing relief food so that residents will vote for Irungu. “Local residents are adequately informed and hence should be left alone to make their own choices on whom to elect,” Muriithi said. Kiunjuri has been campaigning for President Uhuru Kenyatta and wants voters to support Jubilee Party. The CS asked them to turn out in large numbers and reelect UhuRuto.
