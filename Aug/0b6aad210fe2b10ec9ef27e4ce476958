The government has intensified day and night patrols in forests in the Kikuyu area following discovery of many bodies dumped in thickets. The latest body to be discovered in the forest is that of the electoral agency’s ICT manager Chris Msando who went missing on Friday. Kikuyu deputy county commissioner Paul Famba confirmed that two bodies of middle-aged men were dumped in the forest next to Kenya Agricultural Research Institute, Zambezi area, over the weekend. Famba says the bodies were not immediately identified because they didn’t bear any documents. However, two weeks ago two bodies were found by residents on different days, bringing the number to four. “These bodies are spotted by people who enter the forest to graze their domestic animals. They normally report to police,” he said. Speaking to the Star on the phone yesterday, Famba said police investigators suspect victims were killed elsewhere and their bodies disposed of in the area at night. “Two weeks ago, we collected a female body. Two weeks ago we collected a male’s body. They are young people. Last Saturday,  residents were shocked to see two bodies. They are not from the area,” he says. Famba said detectives took the bodies to City Mortuary in Nairobi, where forensic tests will be conducted to help in the identification process. The administrator thanked residents for volunteering information, saying they are shocked at the discoveries. “We have never seen such incidents in the area,” he said. Famba said more APs and regular police backed by Nyumba Kumi officials will be deployed. “We have held a meeting and we have decided we will stop these cases. All of us shall patrol as a team. We will share information,” he said.
