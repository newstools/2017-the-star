The mother of Lamu Senator-elect Anwar Loitiptip says she will not quit her job as an ambulance driver, despite her son’s elevated status. Umi Kher Mohamed, 51, works at the Mpeketoni Subcounty Hospital and has been an ambulance driver for 15 years. She said she does not believe in throwing away a good job simply because another opportunity has arisen. “I’m proud of my son. I have been through a lot raising my children. Poverty has been our guest many times, but I thank God that we have come this far,” Umi told the Star in Lamu town yesterday. “And that’s why I don’t plan on quitting my job just because Anwar is now a senator. I will still continue working to earn my bread and take care of my younger child. I know Anwar will help but I will still do my part as a mother.” Loitiptip, 31, is the third of four children. He won on the Jubilee ticket. Umi said Loitiptip campaigned on foot and sometimes used boda bodas as he did not have money. Loitiptip said he plans to help youth hooked on drugs.
