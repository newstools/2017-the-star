All the Kenyans qualified for the 5,000m final to be run on Sunday. Hellen Obiri won the first race in 14:56.70 with Ethiopia&rsquo;s contender Almaz Ayana in second position (14:57.06) and Senbere Teferi third in 14:57.23.Sheila Chepkirui Kiprotich finished sixth to also make the qualifying mark. Her time of 14:57.58 was also a personal best.Margaret Chelimo Kipkemboi also made it to the final after she finished fifth in the second race won by Ethiopia&rsquo;s Letesenbet Gidey (14:59.34). Dutchwoman Sifan Hassan was second and Shelby Houlihan of the USA third in 15:00.37.Obiri, who is viewed here as a big medal prospect, promised to finish on the podium, especially if the race is fast. &ldquo;My body responded well. I have done my best and I wanted to be in the final and hopefully win a medal. I will plan to race well on Sunday,&rdquo; she told reporters.&ldquo;I am happy to qualify for the final, hopefully the two will join me, so we can do team work to beat Ethiopians.&ldquo;I wanted a fast race as I was keen on doing 15:00, I still have a lot of energy for the Sunday race. As usual, Almaz Ayana will want to run in front, which will be good but only if the race is fast.&ldquo;A slow pace will open the race for everybody. We probably need to do 14:30 so that everybody can run her own race. If Ayana will go in front, I will follow her, but I know that I am the best in 400 metres, so I will be on her.&ldquo;Last year, I focused more on 1,500m than 5,000 but this year, I am in better form 14:25 my PB last year and 14:18 this year. I am in best form ever. I have been training well in 5,000m,&rdquo; she said.
