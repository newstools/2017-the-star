Because of this system of checks and balances, the US has historically been able to correct flaws in its electoral systems that disenfranchised various groups of people. For example, it wasn&rsquo;t until the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that Blacks were able to vote freely, even though the problem persists in some areas.Despite its past problems with the electoral system, it&rsquo;s nearly universally accepted that when it comes to presidential elections, the US system reflects as nearly as possible a rig-free system as one can have. To be sure, there have been times when this has not been the case, the year 2000 being the most recent and notable example. Al Gore challenged the state of Florida&rsquo;s decision to stop counting problem votes to determine for sure who won the state, upon which the presidential winner rested. The Supreme Court, however, dismissed Al Gore&rsquo;s petition, effectively making George W Bush President.Democrats and some independents hated the Supreme Court decision while Republicans and some independents, as well, loved it. The end result was a Bush presidency that never ceased to be a joke in the eyes of the former, even as his popularity soared for some time following the 9/11 terrorist attack.The same can be said about our own Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision to dismiss Raila Odinga&rsquo;s petition, which challenged Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s win in the 2013 presidential race. Progressives and Raila supporters hated the decision as an affront to democracy, while those who backed UhuRuto loved it, and have been living off its stench.And now after another election riddled with massive rigging &mdash; at least from Raila and NASA&rsquo;s perspective &mdash; the opposition walked away from the impending announcement of what they believe to be bogus presidential results. And in their presser they said it would be an exercise in futility and a waste of time to seek redress in the Supreme Court, given the court is, in their view, heavily compromised &mdash; much as it was in 2013 &mdash; to render a different decision.Some, including this writer, differed and argued that Raila and NASA should at least give the Supreme Court the opportunity to redeem itself from the decision of 2013 or join the Mutunga Court in rendering the second, if not worst of all decisions, should the evidence point to nullifying the presidential result but the Court ignores that to render another constitutionally infirm decision to please the Executive or for whatever reason.Knowing the reputation and character of justices sitting in the Supreme Court, one cannot but believe that the majority of them would have to do the right thing and render a decision commensurate with the evidence and, if that decision is affirming the announcement of Uhuru as winner of the presidential tally, so be it. And if the evidence points to Raila having won but somehow the results were altered to give Uhuru a victory he doesn&rsquo;t deserve, then so be it as well and let the Court so declare without fear.That&rsquo;s where we must be as a country. Anything else is a charade unworthy all these sacrifices many have made to get us this far in our democratic pursuits, especially the enshrining in our Constitution and laws the sanctity of voting and voters rights.Last but not least, a word about our so-called &ldquo;independent&rdquo; electoral commissions. These commissions have proven time and again they&rsquo;re neither independent nor a neutral conductor of elections. Each one has proven to be totally useless other than to those they do their bidding therefore they should be scrapped and let a private entity and preferably an international private entity conduct our elections since we have proven we cannot do so ourselves.Samuel Omwenga is a legal expert and political commentator in the United States
