DID NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga parade a genuine IT expert when addressing the nation
over the rigging claims on Wednesday? Kenyans, and especially a mole privy to Corridors’
interest, doubted his professionalism. The mole described the austere guy as a
“hacker” who allegedly studied Veterinary Science. The question our mole is
posing is, “did the Opposition front a fake IT expert to verify their claims
that the IEBC database was infiltrated to allow rigging of the election?” ********  PRESIDENT Uhuru Kenyatta’s
surprising inroads in Western seem to have shook NASA co-principal and Bungoma
Senator Moses Wetang’ula to the bone. Word has it that Wetang’ula’s missing-in-action
no shows during crucial post-election press conferences by his fellow
co-principals was raising eyebrows among many. However, our mole tells
Corridors the senator was camping in Bungoma to ensure that the governor seat
he lost to to New Ford Kenya’s candidate Kenneth Lusaka in 2013 is not snatched
from him. It is said Wetang’ula monitored the tally hampered by delays to
ensure that his Ford Kenya governor candidate Wycliffe Wangamati, who was
trailing Lusaka, was announced the winner. ******** THE outgoing Nyeri County Government led by Governor Samuel Wamathai could face the wrath of
the electorate over embezzlement of public funds. It is said that once the new
county leadership is formed, a team will be constituted to scrutinise a series
of Auditor General and Controller of Budget reports to recover funds misused through
ghost projects. The mole disclosed to us that there are 113 plots of land that
cannot be accounted for. The team will look into gross purchases of goods and
services. Word has it that proper probes will be conducted procedurally,
irrespective of the positions of the county officials. ******** PANIC has gripped many civil servants after a directive
from Chief of Staff and Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua that they report to work without delay, following the
end of Tuesday’s General Election. Some of the government employees were seen
struggling to board matatus from upcountry ahead of today’s roll call by the
state as transport operators hiked prices to cash in on the rush. It remains unclear
if they will be able to manage the 8am reporting time as they stare at unspecified
drastic action. ******** AN impostor branding himself ‘Otieno Kajwang Junior’ has taken social media by storm, trying to
convince Kenyans that NASA lost the presidential contest due to what he termed confused
and disorganised strategy. The individual, whose message circulated on various
WhatsApp groups, congratulated President Uhuru
Kenyatta for his reelection and urged him to embark on uniting the nation.
