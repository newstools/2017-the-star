There is an ongoing plot to lobby President Uhuru Kenyatta to drop Health CS Cleopa Mailu from his government.Also targetted is Mining CS Dan Kazungu, who resigned from the last Parliament to join Cabinet, and, like Mailu, is being accused of not aggressively campaigning for Uhuru.Unconfirmed reports are that Environment CS Judi Wakhungu and her Defence counterpart Raychelle Omamo could also be on their way out.One other person who could be on the way out is Sports CS Hassan Wario due to pressure from the sports and entertainment industries.The four are said not to have delivered in the President&rsquo;s reelection and have underperformed in their ministries. Power brokers now want them out of government.But it is the plot against Mailu that is so deliberate with some operatives in the Office of the President and Kamba leaders meeting twice last week in a Nairobi hotel to make their plan concrete.Want more powerful leaderThe Star has established that Jubilee leaders in Ukambani are seeking to have Mailu dropped and replaced with &ldquo;someone with higher political clout&rdquo;.They say there are people who campaigned better for Uhuru in Ukambani in a move that saw the President get twice as many votes as he did in 2013.&ldquo;We saw people like businessman Peter Muthoka, former MP Regina Ndambuki and Machakos Town MP Victor Munyaka work twice as hard as the CS, despite him having a key position in government,&rdquo; a senior Jubilee Party strategist told the Star.There is anticipation that the President is likely to make changes to his Cabinet, including expanding it to the maximum 22.The Jubilee Ukambani leaders are working closely with power brokers in the Presidency and are hoping to have Mailu replaced during this anticipated reshuffle.Strained relationship with DP RutoSources within Jubilee have also revealed that there appears to be a strained relationship between Mailu and Deputy President William Ruto.&ldquo;We need someone who can work with the DP and help build on the Jubilee gains in Ukambani ahead of Ruto&rsquo;s run for President. The CS is not that person,&rdquo; a source within the Presidency said.Many of the Jubilee leaders from the region who have spoken to the Star have done so in confidence in fear of jeopardising their own chances of getting into government. The Ukambani leaders say that unlike when Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu joined the government in 2013, Mailu lacks the quality to fight for the region. &ldquo;He has no political capital; no political clout. He has spent more time trying to show who is the boss instead of working with the other leaders for the good of Jubilee,&rdquo; one source said.There are also claims that during the campaigns, the CS often campaigned against elected leaders in Jubilee seeking reelection under the guise of &ldquo;Kamba Professionals&rdquo; &ndash; a team he led.The claim is that this group was more interested in getting campaign money instead of focusing on the delivery of votes and seats for Jubilee.Mailu is said to have also failed to campaign for the Jubilee MP candidate in his backyard of Mbooni constituency. Other than local politics, those plotting to have Mailu kicked out of government are also citing his performance at the Ministry of Health.Mailu embarrassed uhuruThose within the Presidency say that the CS embarrassed Uhuru and his family with the so-called Afya House scandal because he was more concerned about getting his PS Nicholas Muraguri fired than protecting the President. &ldquo;He embarrassed the President further when he let the doctors&rsquo; strike go on for months because of his ego, when it could have been solved much earlier,&rdquo; an insider told the Star.Want loyal supporterOn Kazungu, power brokers around the President believe he has not used his position to rally support in his Kilifi county backyard.Uhuru only gained four per cent more on top of his 2013 performance despite the heavy political investment in Kilifi.Those who want Kazungu out say they would rather have someone who has been loyal to the President over the last two years representing the Coast.Omamo and Wakhungu are being targetted for performance in their ministries as well as keeping off the campaign trail ahead of the August 8 election.Players in the entertainment industry have been complaining that Wario has not done enough to facilitate the growth of the industry.A group of these players is said to have prepared a report that will be sent to the President asking that Wario does not continue being a CS.
