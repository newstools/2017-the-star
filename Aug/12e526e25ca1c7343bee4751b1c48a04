In the run-up to the election hundreds rushed for clearance to run as independents, and they were touted as a game changer. But that was not to be. Only two independents, among at least 140, were elected MPs in the North Rift. The Jubilee wave swept the rest aside, despite their spirited campaigns. Five others won MCA seats. The independents said it was a tall order battling party aspirants who were well funded and backed by their party leaders. “Most of the independent candidates performed well if we look at the votes they got, but the lack of resources was a major letdown,” said Ken Wafula, chairman of the independent candidates in Trans Nzoia. He lost the Senate race in Trans Nzoia. The county had the highest number of independent candidates in the North Rift. Deputy President William Ruto will be represented in Parliament by independent legislator Janet Rotich. She defied the odds to win Turbo MP, defeating JP’s Kevin Okwara. Rotich garnered 37,854 votes against Okwara’s 31,928. Ruto’s home is in Sugoi village in the constituency. He had urged residents  to back Okwara, a non-Kalenjin, who won the Jubilee ticket in the primaries.  Chepkonga unseated Okwara has rejected the results, saying there were many malpractices. “There was too much interference in the tallying, including altering figures to ensure I didn’t win just because I am an outsider,” he said. Independent candidate William Chepkut won the Ainabkoi MP seat from MP Samuel Chepkonga. He got 23,216 votes against Chepkonga’s 19,140 votes. Chepkut won the Jubilee primary but the party ordered repeat voting in one polling station and he lost to Chepkonga by 90 votes. He protested that his victory had been snatched away. “My God is a God of second chances. He gave me a second chance because the people of Ainabkoi had decided it was I who would lead them and that is why they have elected me,” Chepkut said. In Soy constituency Kanu candidate Jonathan Bii lost to businessman Caleb Kostany.
