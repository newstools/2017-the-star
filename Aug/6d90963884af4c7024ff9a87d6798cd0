Radio Jambo's breakfast co-host Jacob 'Ghost' Mulee, a lover of wildlife, has raised concern about the effect of the SGR on the animals in the Nairobi National Park. In his recent trip to the park, the radio presenter chanced upon lions mating. "Seeing lions mate was such an experience! Tourists stopped by the scene not only to see how lions mate but to learn more about the big cats. Kenya is indeed a beautiful land. Welcome to our land all tourists across the world," Ghost said. Well, male lions check whether a female is on heat by sniffing her reproductive organs. When the females enter oestrus, they do so for four days, and mating will occur several times an hour. If the female doesn't conceive, she goes back into oestrus two weeks later. During a mating bout, lions have sex 20 to 40 times a day for a couple of days. Established in 1946, the park brings out the beauty of the city and attracts millions of tourists annually. Ghost added, "I love flora and fauna. Whenever I'm in the park, l feel like I am in the garden of Eden, where everything is real. We live in a very fast life and at times you need inner peace and serenity and thus, this is the place to be." But just like others, the former Harambee Stars coach and the owner of Talanta Academy is fearing that the newly constructed SGR may rob Kenya of its beauty and unique heritage: a park within a city. Located approximately seven kilometres south of the centre of Nairobi, Kenya's capital city, with an electric fence separating the park's wildlife from the metropolis, the Nairobi National Park is home to hundreds of animals and over 400 species of birds. "The SGR has already affected the animals, they look confused by the noise of the train. However, the park is big enough for the animals."
