Senator-elect Johnson Sakaja has said his association with Governor-elect Mike Sonko is not personal, but rather based on their common interest of serving the people. He said, &ldquo;I will still oversee his government and ensure he is accountable to the people.&rdquo;This was the preelection pledge Sakaja made during the Senate aspirants&rsquo; debate on July 21. Sakaja said he will set up a county legislative forum comprising all the MPs and MCAs in the city to build their capacity to check the excesses. &ldquo;I will move around the city and listen to what Nairobians want addressed and improve the functionality of the county assembly,&rdquo; he said.The 32-year-old former TNA chairman ran on the Jubilee ticket and got 821,104 votes, beating his closest rival - ODM&rsquo;s Edwin Sifuna - who garnered 678,958.On the Sh72 billion the national government owes the county, Sakaja promised to ensure the debt, if genuine, is factored in the county&rsquo;s revenue allocation through the Division of Revenue Bill. &ldquo;I will also ensure the current formula of allocation of revenue is changed. It should be based on how much the county contributes to the GDP,&rdquo; he said. Sakaja has championed equal opportunities for the youth, women and people living with disability.&ldquo;The biggest threat to our security is the millions of disillusioned, disengaged, and hopeless people outside there who do not have anything to hope for,&rdquo; he said.Sakaja sponsored the Public Procurement and Disposal (Amendment) Bill. It stipulates that 30 per cent of all public tenders be preserved for youth, women and people living with disability. He also sponsored the National Employment Authority Act that provides a legal framework for the state to take affirmative measures to ensure youths and marginalised groups are employed.
