Kisumu Governor elect Anyang Nyong'o has proposed for a parliamentary system of leadership instead of the presidential system. Nyong'o said this will help reduce tensions witnessed during presidential elections and unite the country's ethnic diversity. He said the presidential system is unhealthy for the country where tribalism is at higher level. Nyong'o added that the presidential system is subjecting Kenyans who sacrifice  time to exercise their democratic right only to be denied justice every five years of election. "We need to work on how we can have parliamentary system of leadership in place to prevent Kenyans such injustice," Nyong'o added. He said the nation cannot afford a situation where people cling to power through unconstitutional means. "The current system takes the country backward democratically and should be done away with," the governor elect said. The outgoing Kisumu senator trounced incumbent Jack Ranguma and three other candidates. Nyong'o who contested on Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) ticket garnered 272,172 votes against Ranguma (Independent) coming in second position with 156,963 votes. The County IEBC Returning Officer John Cox Lorionokou said Kisumu remained peaceful during the elections period unlike in the past where lives have been lost urging the leaders to take up their new responsibilities seriously to steer the county’s development forward. Speaking after the results announcement, Nyong’o promised to spearhead the development of the county. He said his government will give priority to laying down proper structures of devolution such as establishing village councils and the city board.
