Nzai, his closest challenger, had 14,914 votes.Twalib was sworn-in yesterday alongside other elected and nominated MPs.Nzai said he wants justice for the people of Jomvu because their voice has not been respected.&ldquo;I filed the petition on Monday and would not like to discuss it further,&rdquo; the former Jomvu Kuu MCA said.On Wednesday, Wiper&rsquo;s Mathias Shipeta said he has documentary evidence that shows massive irregularities.He instructed his lawyers to look at the evidence and come up with a strong case.Shipeta emerged a distant fourth in the race. He had 2,151 votes. Independent candidate Dan Aloo was third with 4,869 votes.&ldquo;This is not about me. It&rsquo;s about losing and winning fairly and ensuring the people of Jomvu&rsquo;s voice is heard,&rdquo; Shipeta said.Nzai welcomed Shipeta&rsquo;s move. He said the search for justice should not be about who wins the seat, but about the law being upheld and the merchants of impunity being stopped.But Shipeta says Nzai is party to the irregularities.&ldquo;Both Badi and Nzai, who were projected the winners and runners up, were part of these irregularities,&rdquo; he said.
