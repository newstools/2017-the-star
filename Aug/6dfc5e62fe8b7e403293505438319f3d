Are your friends safe? Facebook has made it simpler to see whether friends have checked in as &ldquo;safe&rdquo; on the online platform.This can be during disasters or other dangerous events that may be happening all around the world.The safety check feature has been given its own section along with friends, groups, events and other main categories at the leading social network&rsquo;s mobile application and desktop pages.A statement from the company&rsquo;s official account read: &ldquo;Safety Check helps our community let loved ones know they are safe during a crisis, find and give help, as well as learn more about a crisis.There&rsquo;s now a single place to go to see where Safety Check has recently been activated, get the information you need and potentially be able to help affected areas.&rdquo;The modification began rolling out on Monday.
