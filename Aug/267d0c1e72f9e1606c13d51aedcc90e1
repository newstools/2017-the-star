Former Vitimbi actor Mama Kayai, the judge to Vioja Mahakamani Lucy Wangui and fellow actor Gibson Mbugua have spoken out for the first time about the passing on of their fellow iconic actor, Benson Wanjau, who was known as Mzee Ojwang. He died in July last year, and after being buried, news emerged that he was bedevilled with financial difficulties. In an exclusive interview, the three debunked those rumours, saying, "Mzee Pembe (Mzee Onjwang) hakufa akiwa masikini, watoto wake aliwa-educate wote, mpaka dakika ya mwisho akija kufa walikua wamemueka vizuri sana. Art inalipa na ni nzuri ni kazi kama ile ingine.” The three told Word Is the reason why they left KBC. It turns out that the two local drama shows were owned by KBC and according to them, some people felt that they were too “old” for the job and decided that a new crew should take over. This meant that the former Vioja Mahakamani crew would be left jobless, as what they called ‘young’ minds were set to take over the job. Aisha Khavere, Mama Kayai’s real name, says Vitimbi crew then came together in solidarity to defend their friends of Vioja Mahakamani who had been kicked out. But then, were they paid well? “Hio kidogo tulikua tunalipwa lazima ujipange nayo. Si eti unalipwa kidogo inakushinda kujipanga. Ikiwa hiyo ndogo unapatiwa inakushinda kujipanga kwa hiyo hata hiyo nyingi ukipewa itaisha kabisa. Kwa hivyo nilikua najipanga na hio kidogo nilikua napewa.” For three years now, the crew from the two local drama shows have gone silent. However, they now have a new show that premiered last weekend.
