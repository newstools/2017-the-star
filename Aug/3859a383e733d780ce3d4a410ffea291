The press conference yesterday at which Kisumu Senator Anyang’ Nyong’o announced the “disappearance” of KDF spokesman Joseph Owuoth was a terrible example of why leaders have to be very careful what they say at all times. Colonel Owuoth not long afterwards confirmed he is alive and well. Concerns about Owouth’s welfare arose from the documents presented by NASA on Operation Dumisha Utulivu. The disappearance claims were made at a time of high tensions and fears following the murder of IEBC ICT manager Chris Msando. The best procedure of reporting missing persons is to alert the police first, not necessarily media. And if we don’t trust the local police for whatever reason, there is always the option of bringing in the FBI and Scotland Yard, as was done in lawyer Willie Kimani’s murder case, where the evidence adduced in court has been formidable indeed. The Kisumu politicos engaged in their own version of fake news - and sought to enjoin social and news media in it.
