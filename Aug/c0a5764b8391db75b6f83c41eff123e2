Uhuru Kenyatta is the coolest dad ever! In a Facebook Live conversation with Kenyans, Uhuru explained why his children, Jomo, Ngina and Muhoho, are not hitting the campaign trail. One Facebooker asked the President. "Where have you hidden your children, we rarely see them on the campaign trail?" Uhuru responded, "I haven't hidden them anywhere. They are up and about doing their own things. I don't want them involved unless they do desire the campaign. I want them to live life like every other Kenyan. I want them to be able to achieve their own dreams and objectives like every other Kenyan." He continued, "And it is not their business to be out there campaigning for me. If they so desire they do it in their own way. It is my business to ensure that I do everything that I can to protect them, to defend them and to create a country and a nation for them where they can the best they can be in whatever it is that they shall choose to do. And that is my dream. It is my desire not just for my own children but for every single one of our children in our republic. That is my job, that is my objective and that is what I seek to do and that is why I seek Kenyans to give me an opportunity to do for all children of the country."
