Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago (Jubilee) has endorsed a second ODM MCA candidate to battle against a Jubilee candidate in Huruma ward within Eldoret town. Mandago teamed up with Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi to campaign for the ODM candidate Andrew Sure who will face off with Jubilee's Peter Chomba. A week ago Mandago and Sudi also backed an ODM candidate in Langa's ward. Chomba and Langas MCA Francis Muya have been critics of Mandago and the governor says he will ensure they are voted out. "We have no problem with the Kikuyu community but it's Chomba and Muya who think they can stop us from working with other people in the community", said Mandago. The governor and Sudi have urged residents of Eldoret to turn out in large numbers and vote. Mandago will face off with Independent candidate Bundotich Kiprop Buzeki in Tuesday's polls and the two have been battling for the control of non-Kalenjin votes in Eldoret considered the swing vote that might determine the winner on Tuesday.

The county boss, who was backed by NASA flag bearer Raila Odinga despite being a Jubilee Party candidate, said he does not regret the move. Mandago said he will back orange party candidates in Langas and Huruma wards until they win unless those opposing him apologise. The situation has resulted in a battle against MCAs Francis Muya and Peter Chomba respectively, who are defending their seats on Jubilee Party tickets.
