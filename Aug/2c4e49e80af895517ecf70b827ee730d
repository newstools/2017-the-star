Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko on Sunday honoured his pre-election pledge to Akamba elders by donating a 14-seater van to be used by the elders for their transport needs. The elders had requested a vehicle in July when they installed Sonko as a Kamba elder and endorsed him for the Nairobi governor race. Sonko handed over the vehicle at his home in Mua Hills on Sunday. “I thank the elders who have walked the journey with me. I give them this 14-seater van as my appreciation and will give them another in due course,” he said. Sonko promised to buy a van for a group of women dancers who were with the elders. Elders’ chairman Boniface Kilonzo thanked the governor and said he is a visionary and should lead the Akamba community. “As elders we have seen the future and are sure of Sonko’s good leadership. We will soon give him the mantle to lead this community,” Kilonzo said.
