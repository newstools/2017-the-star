Crab Shack is the place to wine and dine while looking down at the Indian Ocean as you watch the sun set.Its set-up above the ocean is not the only captivating part, as its environment will attract you even more.As you enter the place, you will have to walk on boards, giving you the feeling you might be walking through the Biblical heaven&rsquo;s gate.On your first time at the Crab Shack, you might consider closing your eyes, as the height and the thoughts of walking above the ocean waters can freak you out.During my first visit, a staff member had to hold my hand as I walked through to the restaurant, since I have a fear of heights.The place is surrounded by mangrove trees, which gives it a magnificent and breathtaking atmosphere.If you deliberately arrive early before dinner time, you have various leisure options, including canoing.You can take a boat ride to an island, which can only be compared to wonderland, as you get time to be alone on the sandy beach. The drive takes at least 30 minutes. You can also view different types of birds, which fly freely without suspicion of your intrusion to their habitant.Dinner is served from 6 pm.This is the one of the few hotels in Watamu where you can be served a sumptuous meal of crabs.You can grab a glass of wine and watch as the chefs harvest the crabs from their cages and prepare them for eating.A meal of crab can be accompanied with coconut rice or fries. The restaurant also offers unique crab samosas.A plate of dinner only costs Sh1,500.You can also buy the crabs to cook at home at Sh400 per kilo.As you wait for dinner to be ready, you can venture into bird watching inside the mangrove forest.Even though Crab Shack does not offer accommodation,the place offers a conference hall, which can host at least 200 attendants.
