All polling stations have KIEMS kits and spare ones are available in case of failure, the IEBC has said.The announcement followed reports on Tuesday that voters at Rabuor polling centre in Nyando subcounty, Kisumu, are disappointed following "total failure" of IEBC machines for two streams.The machines cannot detect voters' finger prints at these streams but the election process is smooth in the others.Technicians were called to inspect and repair them as voters, who arrived as early as 3am on Tuesday, waited to select politicians who will lead them for the next five years.More on this: Kenya Decides: Missing names, KIEMS 'total failure' in parts of KisumuBut IEBC said: "All 40,883 polling stations have a KIEMS kit and there are 4,117 more on stand-by in case of anything."The electoral agency further urged Kenyans to wait their turns instead of cutting queues."While in line, be civil. Do not cut in line and do not discuss who you are voting for or ask others the same."In Nairobi, voters at Westlands Primary School said they had been waiting too long in the same spots."We have been standing here for long...it's like some people are taking their sweet time in the rooms," one said.The commission also asked Kenyans to exercise caution by taking steps such as not wearing colours that could spark chaos."Do not wear any branded clothing items or badges which identify which party or candidate you are voting for."VOTERS NOT IDENTIFIED BY KIEMSAt least four voters in Mvita Constituency, Mombasa, have not been identified by the Kenya Integrated Electoral Management System.The cases were reported at the Central Girls', Tononoka Nursery and Tononoka Social Hall polling stations at about 8am.The Presiding Officers from these stations said finger print checks failed and that several alphanumeric tests were also unsuccessful.In such scenarios, POs have to check names of affected voters in the IEBC register but there were no registers in most polling stations.Central Girls' PO Tobias Odilla said he was still waiting for a register.Tononoka Nursery's Wakah Wanjiku said: "There was shortage of materials. We had been promised complimentary registers but we are yet to receive them."Security was beefed up at various locations and no case of unrest has been reported so far.Most of the constituency's 58 polling stations had been opened by around 6:10am.An hour afte voting started, an average of 30 people had voted.Mombasa Senator Hassan Omar, who is Wiper governor candidate, will vote at Kaderboy Old Town Dispensary at 11am.His Jubilee counterpart Suleiman Shahbal will cast his ballot at Tononoka Nursery at 10am.More on poll: Frustrate rigging schemes and violence, Ruto asks God as Kenyans vote
