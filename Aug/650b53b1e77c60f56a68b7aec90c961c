Former Lands CS Charity Ngilu crushed her opponents Kitui Senator David Musila and incumbent Julius Malombe in the race for Kitui governor. By 4pm yesterday, she had 161,146 votes (47.5 per cent) against Musila’s 107,005 (31.5 per cent) and Malombe’s 70,944 (20.9). The majority of votes for Ngilu across the county appears to be a revolt against Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka. Before the Tuesday polls, Kalonzo had visited his home Kitui county and urged locals to stand with him and  vote for his party’s candidate Malombe. He said this would give him bargaining power at the national level. Last Saturday at a rally in Kyuso, Mwingi North subcounty, Kalonzo said rejecting Wiper candidates would make him an “immaculately dressed man with no pants”. Ngilu will likely have to strike a balancing act working with Wiper MPs because although her Narc party fielded candidates, they are not seen as strong contenders.
