Meru Governor-elect Kiraitu Murungi (pictured) has told outgoing chief Peter Munya to ‘relax’ because he will not revenge. He said Munya should respect the will of the people and avoid going to court. “Munya should be told to leave the field as the match has ended. The referee has blown the whistle,” Kiraitu said. He will create an all-inclusive Meru Economic and Social Council as a permanent think tank for social economic tranformation. Kiraitu said he will create ward development boards and allocate each Sh100 million to drive development. He said will not be a lone ranger “like my predecessor”. “As a Jubilee elected governor, I will work with the national government to improve security, roads, health care and education to improve Meru county,” Kiraitu said. He will be a servant leader. “The days of big man politics are long gone with Munya. Don’t call me Your Exellency because I’m your brother. I have not come here for titles, but to work for the people,” Kiraitu said. He said his government will invest in agriculture because “it is the fastest way of getting Meru out of poverty”.
