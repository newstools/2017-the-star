Five members of the National Assembly in Kericho county lost their seats to newcomers. Only one is heading back to the 12th Parliament. Those who lost are Ainamoi’s Benjamin Langat, Belgut’s Eric Keter, Jackson Rop of Kipkelion West, Bureti’s Leonard Sang and Sigowet/Soin’s Justice Kemei. Kipkelion East Joseph Limo  survived the wave of change. Kemei and Sang on Wednesday conceded defeat. Newcomers are youthful Nelson Koech (Belgut), Silvanous Martim (Ainamoi), Kipsengeret Koros (Sigowet/Soin), Japheth Mutai (Bureti) and Hilary Koske (Kipkelion West). The losers, save for Justice Kemei (Jubilee Party) were defending their seats as independents after losing in the JP primaries in April. Koros won the Sigowet/Soin seat as an independent. Limo won in the Jubilee primaries and went ahead to win at the Tuesday poll. Meanwhile, Governor Paul Chepkwony has retained his seat.
