Kiharu MP Irungu Kang'ata has urged all bar operators to close their businesses on the eve of the election so people will not be too hangover to vote the next day. He said this will reduce the chances of politicians buying alcohol for the youth so they don't vote. Kang'ata was speaking on Tuesday at Ndakaini, Gatanga, during the finals of a tournament he had organised in Kariara ward. "We need all adults to cast their votes so we can have a sure winner, especially in the presidential vote," he said. Kang'ata is running for Murang'a senator on the Jubilee ticket. He said some politicians are notorious for intoxicating their rivals' supporters before an election to keep them from voting. The legislator urged security agencies to be on the lookout for such. "Am asking all businesses to consider closing down to give everyone ample time to prepare to vote," he said. Kang'ata said Jubilee candiates will transport all old people from their homes to polling stations. Governor Mwangi Wairia has previously said he will hire boda boda operators to ferry the old and the sick to polling stations. Kang'ata criticised his rival Senator Kembi Gitura for spreading propaganda that his candidature has been sponsored by Wairia. He said Gitura has written a letter to some churches indicating he will work together with Wairia if reelected. "Kembi is being hypocritical. Why is he now saying he will work with Wairia yet he has been saying I should not be elected because I am friends with Wairia," Kang'ata said.
