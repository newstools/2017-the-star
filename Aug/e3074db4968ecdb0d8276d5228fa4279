Balambala MP-elect Abdi Shurie has praised outgoing MP Abdikadir Aden for a good job. Shurie garnered 8,901 votes against Aden’s 5,040 in the General Election. Speaking to the press in Garissa town, Shurie said that Aden “tried to do his best for the constituents”. “It is no secret that he did a very good job during his term, however, I know a lot still needs to be done,” he said. “In my five years ahead, my responsibility will be to allay fears, restore our sense of optimism and rediscover a spirit of conquest, which embodies the brotherhood spirit.” Shurie, the son of AP commandant Omar Shurie, said his responsibility will be to bring every woman and man together, to address problems that residents face.  Elders’ choice The Abduwak elders picked Shurie to run for the post. This was criticised by Aden, who said he will contest and recapture the seat. He described Shurie as an outsider who was being imposed on residents by a group of “self-seeking individuals”. The elders, powerful businessmen and Garissa Township MP–elect Aden Duale made several trips in the rural constituency to turn the tide against Aden. Since the loss, nothing has been heard from Aden, who ran on the ODM ticket.
