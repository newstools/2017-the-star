Do you remember the ‘Githeri Man’? Kenya’s newest celebrity? Well, if the train left you, he is the man who has won many Kenyans' hearts after a photo of him holding a paper bag of githeri while queuing to vote went viral on social media. As always, Kenyans on social media did what they do best. They made hilarious memes of the man, photoshoping the middle aged man in almost every iconic picture around the world, much to everyone’s amusement. He was photoshopped alighting from a helicopter with President Uhuru Kenyatta, celebrating Kenya 7’s historic first sevens world series win, chilling with popular rappers Kanye West and Drake, among many others. With all said and done, one Chris Kirwa, a prominent events planner, was touched by the memes and more so the iconic photo of the man, and he has urged Kenyans to help locate the man and make his life better. "Dear Kenyans – Now that #GitheriMan is trending … thanks to all of us posting him …. can we locate him and find out his life situation and see if we can make a difference by celebrating him and his family ? He is uncelebrated Hero Right now," read Chris Kirwa’s Facebook post in part.
