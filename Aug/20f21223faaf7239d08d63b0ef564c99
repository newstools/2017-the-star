Four North Rift governors have pledged to support Council of Governors chairman Josphat Nanok for reelection. They are West Pokot Governor John Lonyangapuo, Uasin Gishu’s Jackson Mandago, Elgeyo Marakwet’s Alex Tolgos and Trans Nzoia’s Patrick Khaemba. They endorsed Nanok during his swearing-in ceremony at Ekaales Centre in Lodwar on Saturday. Mandago said, “We will ensure that Governor Nanok remains as the Council of Governors chairman. I want to assure him that we will unite behind him as North Rift governors.” Nanok said he will deliver on his preelection promises, including supplying clean water for domestic use and irrigation. He said he will work with international agencies, including the UN, to make Turkana food secure during his second and final term. Nanok said the CoG will resume talks with striking nurses after all governors are sworn in. “I am confident that CoG will work closely with the national government to ensure nurses resume work,” he said. He said he will work with the state to promote peace among herders living on borders.
