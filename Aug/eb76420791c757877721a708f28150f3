Migori Governor Okoth Obado’s reelection bid has faced a new obstacle after the Catholic Church urged its faithful not to vote for him next week following protracted land disputes. On Sunday, the church issued leaflets, explaining a Sh25 million loss it incurred following court cases filed by the county government. Last week, Bishop Philip Anyolo of Homa Bay parish, which covers parts of Migori and Homa Bay counties, issued leaflets to churches explaining how four pending court cases on land ownership have derailed their performance. The leaflets, which were also shared on social media, listed the cases on ownership of land in Kitere and another in Rapogi, which is Obado’s home village. On June 30, Father James Omondi of Rakwaro parish, where the Kitere is, said the the church stands “for truth and justice even if it hurts”.
