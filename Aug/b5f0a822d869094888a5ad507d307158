Each of the 290 constituencies will have four innovation hubs to encourage more youths to venture into online jobs. The government hopes to create one million online opportunities by 2018 through the initiative.The project, set to kick off in the 2017/2018 financial year, is a partnership between the Ministry of ICT, National Constituency Development Fund Board and Members of Parliament and will involve construction of 1,160 hubs across the country. The centres will provide free Internet and Wi-Fi access to residents. Each hub will cost Sh1,169,256 funded by the Constituency Development Fund (CDF) which means Sh1.4 billion will be used for construction and equipping of the hub.The Ministry of ICT will on the other hand cater for monthly recurring bandwidth utilization charges.Kenya&rsquo;s internet penetration rate is about 85.3 percent according to the regulator Communications Authority of Kenya, high compared to 28.7 percent for the continent.The Cabinet Secretary of Information Communication and Technology Joe Mucheru said the hubs will be used as centres that will facilitate on-line freelancing in an effort to make Kenya a tech-hub.&ldquo;Four constituency innovation hubs will be set up in each constituency making up a total of 1160 hubs nationally. Members of Parliament are expected to prioritize the project in the proposals for their respective constituencies to the CDF in order to secure funding during the current financial year,&rdquo; the CS said in a statement. &ldquo;This is a huge platform for self employment and making Kenya the next technological hub which will ensure we fight the unemployment factor in the country.&rdquo;In 2016, Kenya started a digital skills training programme to enable young people to secure freelance on-line work before 2018 in a bid to tackle the country&rsquo;s acute youth unemployment problem.Currently, there is an estimated 40,000 Kenyans who have secured on-line work ranging from transcription services to software development on sites like Amazon&rsquo;s MTURK and the Kenyan-owned Ajira platform.According to the ministry, 11 constituency innovation hubs have been constructed across the country including one in Limuri, four in Mathioya, one in Kajiado West, two in South Imenti, two in Vihiga and the Rift Valley innovation center.
