A case against former Mungiki leader Maina Njenga (pictured) and four others did not proceed on Monday because his co-accused has died. The co-accused are Daniel Wanjohi, Francis Mwangi, Ngare Njogu and Stephen Kuria. The five are charged with violently robbing three police officers of guns and cash at his Hope Church in Thome Estate, Nairobi, four years ago. They have denied the charges and are out on Sh200,000 bond each. Yesterday, the defence said Wanjohi has died. The magistrate directed that the case be mentioned on August 30 to confirm if he is dead.
