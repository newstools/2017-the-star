As a reelection gesture, Governor Mwangi Wairia bailed out 26 petty offenders at Murang’a Prison. The prisoners who committed minor crimes were unable to raise the fines imposed by the courts, some as little as Sh1,000. On Friday, Wairia paid their fines as a way of celebrating his reelection. He said they have a second chance to reform and get their lives back on track. Wairia said he realised many people were languishing in prison because they could not raise trifling fines. Most of those released had been jailed for offences such as drunkenness and petty theft. “I am doing this as a sign of goodwill after being the only governor to be reelected in the entire region,” he said. Wairia said he consulted with the management of the prison to draw up a list of the prisoners who would be released.
