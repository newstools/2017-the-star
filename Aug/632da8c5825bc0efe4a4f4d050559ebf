Well, Kenyan sportsmen and women have come out to urge their fans to maintain peace during and after the election. "I have had the opportunity to play for the two biggest football teams  (AFC Leopards and Gor Mahia)in Kenyan football and we are always brothers in and outside the football pitch thus lets do the same my brothers and sisters before and after elections," Harambee Stars and AFC Leopards striker Paul 'Modo' Kiongera wrote. Homeboyz defender Edwin Wafula wrote; "Don't kill please let's have a peaceful election. Siombi kura. Naomba AMANI.  #PEACE," read Malkia Strikers queen Atuka Trizah's message. Veteran footballer Simon Mulama has also asked Kenyans to maintain peace adding, "Let us all work towards peace, love and understanding. An eye for an eye only gets everyone blind." "Elections are here once more, I am urging the voters to maintain calmness and peace and our leaders to accept the results and decision of the voters," said Bamba Sports football analyst Innocent Mutiso. Former Harambee Stars coach and Radio Jambo breakfast co-host, Jacob 'Ghost' Mulee is also calling upon Kenyans to exercise free and fair elections and maintain peace. "Elections will come and go, vote wisely! Like they say, vote and go home. We need a peaceful Kenya even after elections there is Kenya.  I love Kenya with a passion it is a beautiful country. If you ever ask me which is the most beautiful country I have ever been to, I will tell you Kenya. For one good reason there is no country like Kenya. The people are great, the country is superb and we are a great blessing. After 8th let’s keep it intact let us keep Kenya, Kenya because this country is beautiful Peace guys!"
