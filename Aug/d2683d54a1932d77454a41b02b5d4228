A faction of Njuri Ncheke elders on Tuesday stormed their headquarters in Nchiru and forced their way into the shrine they were barred from entering by a splinter group. The group, led by secretary general Phares Rutere and chairman Paul M’ithinkia and which is recognized by the registrar of societies, organised for a convoy of vehicles to enter the shrine. They were barred by a faction, led by secretary general Josephat Murangiri and chairman Linus Kathera after they installed Kithure Kindiki as an elder and appointed him the official Meru spokesperson in February 2015. Outgoing Governor Peter Munya, an elder, criticised the appointment of Kindiki and termed elders who endorsed him “greedy”. He said, “We respect the Njuri Ncheke... but our current Njuri Ncheke is not representing the interests of the Meru community.”
