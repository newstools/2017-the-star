Equity Bank Chess team bagged two medals in the just concluded African Clubs chess Championship, which ended on Tuesday in Cairo, Egypt. The team made its maiden appearance on the continent and competed against some of the best chess players, who included Grand Master Amin Bassem. The tournament featured eight teams from Libya, Egypt and Kenya after Zambia, Algeria, Angola and South Africa pulled out of the tournament. Commenting on the performance, Equity Bank chess captain Bernard Wanjala said the tournament offered the team a chance to prove themselves and this will go a long way in building the confidence of the team in future. “Chess is still a fledgling sport especially in a country like Kenya. Getting such rare opportunities enables young people who have great interest in the sport to hone their skills,” Wanjala added. Equity Bank, the current national chess league leaders, emulated their league performance as they crushed their fierce rivals to maintain their splendid start in Cairo. However, Egypt dominated the rest of the tournament with Alhawar, Eastern Company (A) and Eastern Company (B) taking the first, second and third places respectively. Equity placed fifth overall in the championships.
