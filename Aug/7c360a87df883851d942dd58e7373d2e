MCA-elect Abdi Guyo has denied reports President Uhuru Kenyatta coerced the yet-to-be-sworn-in Jubilee MCAs into electing Beatrice Elachi as assembly speaker.Guyo, who is poised to be majority leader after Jubilee won most of the seats, said they agreed on the line-up of their own volition.&ldquo;The President did not force us to elect Elachi. He actually left us on our own to come up with a line-up that will oversee the affairs of the House,&rdquo; he said.Uhuru met with all elected Nairobi Jubilee leaders at State House on Saturday, when a &lsquo;deal&rsquo; was reached on who should head the county assembly.Elachi would be the speaker, Guyo the majority leader and Ngara MCA-elect Mwaura Chege the majority chief whip.The party got 45 out of the 85 elective seats, tilting the scales of electing a speaker in its favour. NASA has 40 seats. JP is also set to nominate 24 MCAs, while NASA will have 18.
