Tharaka Nithi Governor Muthomi Njuki has defended his decision to sack county staff despite warnings from the Public Service Commission on Cotu. PSU chair Margaret Kobia and Cotu boss Francis Atwoli on Wednesday warned governors against arbitrarily dismissing employees. Kobia said it will plunge counties into deep financial crises as public funds will not be used to pay hefty legal costs arising from the dismissals. But Njuki said he is only targeting ghost workers who are illegally drawing salarie. "No employee with the right skills, doing the right job will go home," he said on Wednesday. He claimed the majority of workers he sent home were drawing salaries without having any formal contract with the county and some were earning double salaries with no records at the Human Resource department. "This is only the beginning, the initial group is 960 employees and most of them are casuals brought in for political reasions," said Njuki. The move, he claimed, will see the county that reportedly received an average of Sh3.7 billion save Sh25 million every month. “I know people who do nothing in the county , go to the bank earn salary and then goes back to their private business,” he said that must stop. A head count commissioned last year, he said, revealed that up to 360 people could not be accounted for by the HR department. He said the bloated payroll was done to intentionally help the former governor to retain seat. Siaya, Meru, Uasin Gishu and Machakos counties tops the list of counties where governors have sent packing employees in unclear circumstances immediately after swearing in.
