Anne Waiguru was yesterday sworn in as the Kirinyaga governor in a fete that was attended by Deputy President William Ruto. Security was tight in the Kirinyaga University grounds. Waiguru took an oath administered by High Court judge Jairus Ngaah at 12.15pm. Her deputy - Peter Ndambiri - also took an oath administered by chief magistrate Samuel Soita. Former Runyenjes MP Cecily Mbarire, who unsuccessfully contested for Embu governor, said the election of Waiguru, Joyce Laboso (Bomet) and Charity Ngilu (Kitui) shows society is changing to accommodate women leaders. Ijaara MP Sophia Abdi - the first elected woman legislator from Northeastern - hailed the election of Waiguru. Waiguru said she will unite the county and improve infrastructure. She said she will deliver as promised. Kirinyaga woman representative-elect Wangui Ngirici skipped the event. She told the Star she was not invited. This points to the differences between the two. Wangui openly campaigned for Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua, who was eyeing the governor’s seat. Kajiado woman representative Peris Tobiko said Waiguru has the potential to be President after Ruto runs. Other attendees included Beth Mugo, a former nominated senator, and Kandara MP Alice Wahome. Mugo said the case NASA filed at the Supreme Court seeking to nullify President Uhuru Kenyatta’s reelection will collapse because “JP’s win was clean”. Dagoreti South MP-elect John Kiarie said Waiguru is capable of leading Kirinyaga county to greater heights. Kiarie, popularly known as KJ, urged Waiguru and Ndambiri to serve residents wisely. Kanini Kega, the MP elect for Kieni constituency, urged residents to support Waiguru.
