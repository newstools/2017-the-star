Governors Jackson Mandago of Uasin Gishu and Alex
Tolgos of Elgeyo Marakwet, both of Jubilee, were reelected despite facing stiff competition from independent candidates in
their respective counties. Jubilee’s Stephen Sang was also elected as Nandi governor. Provisional results indicated Mandago had garnered
more than 184,000 votes against his rival Bundotich Kiprop's 135,000. Mandago said he was happy with the results so far
but, “Let us wait for the final figures.” Kiprop, popularly known as Buzeki, did not comment but he had indicated that he would
accept the results and back the winner because he respects the people’s
wish. He ran as an independent. In Nandi, Sang had polled unassailable votes at more
than 222,000 while his rival Andrew Serem (independent) had slightly
more than 7,000 votes. “I am happy that we are headed for victory and my
first agenda will be to unite the people of Nandi and work with all elected
leaders in the region," he said. In Elgeyo Marakwet, Tolgos had polled 64,941 against
his main challenger independent candidate Moses Changwony who had 48,951 with
most polling stations having completed counting. In Uasin Gishu, former Registrar of the Judiciary Gladys
Boss Shollei was headed for victory as woman representative and with most
polling station counted she had polled more than 201,229 votes against the 78,746
of her main rival Rael Chebichi. Former Education minister Professor Margaret Kamar won
the Senate seat as she had an unassailable 206,888 votes against her main rival Robert Kemei (independent) who had polled 81,051 with more than three
quarters of votes counted. For the parliamentary seats in Uasin Gishu, Caleb
Kostany of Jubilee was ahead with 32,032 against Kanu’s Jonathan Bii who had 24,918. In Ainabkoi constituency, independent William Chepkut had polled 21,163 against MP Samwel Chepkonga (Jubilee) who had
17,316 votes with only a few polling stations yet to be counted. “I am happy that all indications give us victory. It
is a hard-won victory which was stolen during the Jubilee primaries,” Chepkut said. He lost to Chepkonga in the primaries. Independent candidate Janet Rotich was leading in the Turbo seat, which
is home to DP William Ruto, after beating Jubilee’s Kevin Okwara. In Moiben
