The high court has directed the Kenya Taekwondo Association to withdraw a case they filed in court against the National Olympic Commission by Wednesday this week.Justice Chacha Mwita gave the parties until tomorrow to each reach a settlement and withdraw the matter from the courts.Lawyer Kimutai Bosek, representing the Kenya Taekwondo Association, told the court that they are negotiating the matter and are yet to reach a consent.Meanwhile the earlier orders given by the court stopping the elections have been extended until Wednesday this week.In May this year, the High Court stopped the National Olympic Committee of Kenya elections after KTA sought an injunction of the same.The elections were slated for May 6 but the KTA secured a court injunction after they were barred from participating in the polls by the elections board.The KTA went to court seeking intervention after their members were banned from taking part in the elections due to a leadership row at the organisation.The association said the decision to bar its members from participating in the Noc-k election is discriminatory and against their legitimate expectations.Election overseers said internal battles over the leadership of the KTA meant they couldn&rsquo;t vote or stand for positions.Another association which was asked to keep off the elections is Kenya Cycling Federation.Kenya Table Tennis Association and Kenya Judo Association are among the interested parties in the case and they are opposed the suit, saying the federation has no legal capacity to institute the suit.
