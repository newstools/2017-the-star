Nairobi county owes current and former employees close to Sh18 billion in unpaid statutory deduction, Governor Mike Sonko has said."This has caused untold suffering especially for those who have to pay from their pockets for treatment covered under NHIF. It has also caused untold suffering to retirees," Sonko said.Speaking when he met Nairobi City County Workers Union, Sonko said his administration will make sure that the suffering of the workers are addressed.He was responding after the union complained of delays in paying salaries, deprived promotions, unremitted statutory deductions, dilapidated uniforms, a hostile administration among others."A comprehensive human resource audit shall be undertaken in Nairobi county to fast track portions and salary reviews," Sonko said."I shall ensure timely payment of salaries and implement the Collective Bargaining Agreement they have been striving to get implemented."Sonko said all workers shall be provided with appropriate gear and equipment to better undertake their duties adding that regular meetings will be carried out with the officials."Noting that lack of participation and inclusiveness negatively affected the plight of workers, Sonko said he will change that narrative."There shall be representatives from the workers' union in all deliberations touching on their plight," he said.Sonko said the union unanimously agreed to fully support the ongoing purge to eliminate graft from the county."It is clear that corruption and impunity is the axis of the challenges they face. Today marked a new dawn in the way Nairobi will be run - through consultation and inclusion," he said.The workers complained of delays in paying salaries, deprived promotions, unremitted statutory deductions, dilapidated uniforms, a hostile administration among others.Sonko, who has been on fire since he was elected the governor on August 8, has been carrying out a clean up in the county.On Tuesday, he suspended Nairobi's chief cashier with immediate effect to pave way for thorough investigations into fraud claims.During a sting operation Sonko led on August 23, more than Sh7 million cash that was to be banked the previous day was found.[VIDEO] Sonko leads sting operation at City Hall, finds unbanked Sh7 millionAlso read: [SPEECH] Nairobi will never be the same again, Sonko says at swearing-inRead: 'On fire' Sonko ready to end cartels harassing matatu owners
