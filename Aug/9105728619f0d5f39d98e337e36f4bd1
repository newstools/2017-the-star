A week ago a senior police officer showed up in court drunk, incoherent and unable to testify. He was instructed to pay Sh50,000 bond. On Wednesday, however, chief inspector Biot Wafula came to the court sober and testified before Nakuru principal magistrate Joe Omido. The magistrate lifted the bond. Omido said Wafula was sober and articulate in his testimony, compared to his performance on July 26. Wafula testified in the trial of accused Joshua Waiganjo, an accused police imposter. He also testified against former Rift Valley police boss John M’Mbijiwe and Anti-Stock Theft Unit commandant Remy Ngugi. The two are facing abuse of office charges in relation to Waiganjo’s illegal recruitment and operations within the police force. They are alleged to have allowed Waiganjo to gain access to police vehicles, aircraft and operations and assigned him personal police guards. Wafula told the court OCPD Jacinta Wesonga told him that M’Mbijiwe ordered the release of two lorries to Waiganjo’s younger brother John Waiganjo. They were suspected to have been illegally acquired. “I asked her why but she said that the PPO is threatening her with a suit,” he said. The next hearing is on August 16.
