Twenty-eight out of 30 MCAs in Wajir were voted out in last week’s election. A section of voters interviewed said the majority of MCAs failed to deliver. Other residents were of the opinion that the outgoing county assembly was full of “unqualified members”. “Some of the members were too inexperienced to tackle serious issues in the chamber,” voter Mohamed Ali, 46, from Laqboqol South, said. Only representatives of Barwaqo and Sarman wards retained their seats. The two MCAs are Mohamud Noor for Sarman in Tarbaj constituency, and Barwaqo’s Abdullahi Abikar from Wajir East constituency. Even the immediate former assembly speaker, Bishar Omar, was not spared. He contested for the Wajir East constituency seat and lost to Rashid Kassim. “We sent them home so that it can serve as a warning to the new members,” resident Mohamed Salman said. Wajir has a new governor and senator, Mohamed Abdi and Abdullahi Ali, respectively. They vied on the Jubilee Party ticket. Woman representative Fatuma Gedi was voted in on the Party of Development and Reforms ticket. In addition, apart from Eldas constituency, where Adan Keynan retained his seat, the other constituencies of Tarbaj, Wajir East, Wajir West, Wajir North and Wajir South have new legislators. The new MPs are Ahmed Gaal of Tarbaj, Rashid Amin of Wajir East, Ahmed Ibrahim of Wajir North, Mohamud Mohammed of Wajir South and Ahmed Mohamed of Wajir West.
