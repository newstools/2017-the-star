The who is who of showbiz were given an exclusive invite for an all-white birthday party hosted at the palatial residence of Ben Kang’angi. Guests ranged from the Raverend master Shaffie Weru to corporate honcho Michael Okwiri to comedian Jalang'o and of course, socialite Vera Sidika. The attendees stole the show at Kang’angi’s bash as they flaunted expensive watches, caps shoes, belts, stunners and clothes. They drove in in posh cars, and the security at the venue was tight, not even a fly could dare land anywhere near the event uninvited. Kang’angi is a businessman. In a past Instagram post, he explained that he worked tirelessly to gain his wealth. He reminisced in the post: "After high school, which was marred by endless drama because of lack of school fees or books or proper school uniform or a geometrical set, I decided to join the workforce and was lucky to find work as a pool attendant, a job that afforded me a monthly salary of Sh800! I later moved to my own 500 bob house, which saw me remain with Sh300 for food and transport... Tough times! The salary was so inconsistent and the boss would literally pay or fire me depending on what he felt like, so each day was a big surprise." Adding, "I remember countless nights when I heard people being stabbed right outside our house and still to this day, I can make out their cries for help. I remember seeing body parts the next morning flowing in the open sewers, sometimes for days on end, before the police would come fetch them. I could go on and on but I’ll sum it up and say it was not a sight to behold and truly there isn’t any virtue in poverty." Ben moved on to become a successful businessman who holds his own in the business arena. His friends converged at the party to celebrate him turn a new year.
