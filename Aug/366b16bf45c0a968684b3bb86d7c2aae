The 12th General Election on Tuesday will be Kenya’s biggest-ever electoral event. The numbers are superlative: 16,257 candidates are chasing less than 3,000 elective positions. A hundred and eighty thousand police officers will guard the event. It is the second General Election since the 2007 event that descended into the post-election violence crisis. The PEV saw 1,350 Kenyans killed and 650,000 displaced in barely two weeks. The presidential race is another epic Kenyatta versus Odinga affair. One line keeps being repeated, including by US Ambassador Robert Godec, “No one should die because of an election”. Police self-restraint will be crucial. The cops should not just start shooting live rounds and tear gas canisters at crowds of voters. non-aggressive approach can achieve results without casualties. Towards week’s end, the National Super Alliance changed tack and urged its supporters to vote and then exit the polling stations. The police also urged a stop to the mass exodus of voters to the rural areas for fear of a possible outbreak of violence. Kenyans should deliver their most peaceful and democratic election yet.
