Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen and Governor Alex Tolgos of Jubilee Party have recaptured their seats in resounding victories. Murkomen was declared the winner after garnering 117,398 votes. Tolgos had 87,986 votes. The  results were declared by county returning officer Moses Sunkuli on Thursday night. In the governor race, independents Moses Changwony and Anthony Chelimo garnered 55,986 and 1,011, while  Timothy Biwott (ODM) got 971 votes. Murkomen was not present during the declaration of the results. He thanked his supporters on social media and promised to transform the county. “We have just started. Let us stick together as we transform our county and country,” he said. The senator scooped 80.3 per cent of the total votes cast, beating former IG David Kimaiyo who came second with 21,884 votes. Tolgos survived an onslaught by Changwony who led a team comprising former outgoing Deputy Governor Gabriel Lamaon and former Keiyo South MP Jackson Kiptanui. Changwony mobilsed voters from the Keiyo community to vote out Tolgos, relying on claims that the Marakwets voted for the incumbent overwhelmingly during the JP primaries. The plot, however, failed, as Tolgos garnered 13,521 and 13,650 votes in Keiyo North and Keiyo South. Tolgos was represented by Deputy Governor-elect Wesley Rotich during the 10pm declaration of results. He said he will unite the county  and reconcile their supporters.
