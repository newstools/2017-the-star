Baringo North MP William
Cheptumo of Jubilee has been announced winner after a tight race. This will be his third term in Parliament. Cheptumo was handed
certificate on yesterday morning. He garnered 12,326 votes against his
opponent Joseph Makilap's 12,239. Makilap was seeking the seat on the Peoples Development Reforms. He has faulted the
exercise, saying it was marred with irregularities. “Why was it that the
results delayed until Thursday in Baringo North. The results in other
parts of the country had been announced by Wednesday,” Makilap said. He complained that his opponent
was announced winner, while some polling stations were yet to submit their results. Makilap also criticised subcounty
returning officer Joseph Masinted for declaring Cheptumo the winner. He also refused
to sign form 34A. Makilap demanded to be
allowed to go through all ballots papers so that he could get satisfied. “I would want to go
through the papers before conceding defeat,” he told Masinted. But the returning officer
went ahead and handed over the certificate to Cheptumo under tight security. Cheptumo praised the electoral commission for holding a free, fair and transparent exercise. Others in
the race were Nelly Yatich, who garnered 7,263 votes, Lilian
Chesikaw ( 909 ), Stephen Kipkebut ( 744 ), Sammy Chelanga ( 567 ), Moses Kwonyike ( 364 ), James
Chepkonga ( 29 ). In 2013, Cheptumo defeated Kipkebut, who later moved to court to challenge the results, but
lost. “I am left wondering where
Cheptumo got the votes from, when he seems not to have sufficient
support from the people at the grassroots,” resident Moses Chepkonga and
a supporter of Makilap told
the Star in Kabartonjo yesterday. Chepkonga said Makilap
should move to court to challenge the results if he has evidence the election was not fair.
