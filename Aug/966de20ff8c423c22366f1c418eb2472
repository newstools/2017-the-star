Religious leaders have asked Jubilee and NASA supporters to be calm as the IEBC sorts out issues with the disputed presidential
results tally. The leaders asked IEBC to make forms 34A
available to stakeholders for verifications to avoid suspicions around the process. Inter-Religious Council's
Jackson Ole Sapit raised concern over the rising political tension following several demonstrations in the country. The ACK Archbishop further called upon the Kenyans to resume their daily business as they wait for the declaration of official results. IEBC has said the results of the race pitting ODM's Raila Odinga and incumbent Uhuru Kenyatta may be unveiled tomorrow. "We call upon the
returning officers to appreciate the anxiety in the country and endeavor to
provide any support necessary for completion of the tallying." "Let them submit results to facilitate preparation of all the forms 34B which will guide the declaration of the presidential polls results,"
Sapit said. The clergyman addressed the press at Ufungamano House in Nairobi on Thursday afternoon. The religious leaders defended the electoral agency saying they were still operating within the
law requiring them to announce official results within seven days. "While we appeal for
a quick completion of the tallying and declaration of results by the IEBC, we
ask Kenyans to be patient and allow them  complete the exercise
accurately." The clergy have called upon police forces to execute their mandate of ensuring peace and
security in the country in a humane and restrained manner. Read: Uhuru or Raila? IEBC to announce president tomorrow Also read: NASA, Jubilee inspect forms 34A, 34B after IEBC resorts to manual check
