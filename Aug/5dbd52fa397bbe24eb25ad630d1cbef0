President Uhuru Kenyatta has paid tribute to the late Mama Norma Florienta Kanja, saying she lived a great life of service to her family and the nation. The President spoke when he joined family, relatives, friends and other mourners for the funeral service at Kitisuru in Nairobi. “As we have all heard, she was a wonderful human being and we can testify to that fact. Mama Norma Kanja lived her life well and has left an enduring legacy which should be emulated." He consoled the bereaved, saying: “We stand in solidarity with you during this trying and difficult time of mourning. Our thoughts and prayers will always be with you.” Uhuru was with First Lady Margaret Kenyatta. Mama Norma was mother-in-law to the President younger brother, Muhoho. She died aged 83. Other mourners eulogised her as a forthright, diligent, consummate entrepreneur, valiant, strong-willed and deeply spiritual person who lifted the lives of those who interacted with her. The funeral service was conducted by Father Stephen Mwaria Mukami of St Austin Catholic Church.
