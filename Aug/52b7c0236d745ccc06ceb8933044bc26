The IEBC&rsquo;s failure to cap legal fees for lawyers could see taxpayers fork out hundreds of millions of shillings to pay advocates who will represent the commission in election dispute cases.In March, the commission had announced working on capping legal fees for lawyers in a radical cost-cutting measure to tame exorbitant fees invoices.&ldquo;We are going to arrange a meeting with external lawyers and going forward we will agree on the legal fees and have them sign a binding agreement on maximum fees payable,&rdquo; IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati said then.The IEBC boss told the Parliamentary Justice and Legal Affairs Committee that it would be no longer business as usual for lawyers who had long used the commission as a cash cow.Policy to cap lawyers&rsquo; fees floppedHowever, the Star has established that the policy suggestion flopped after the commission failed to convene a meeting with lawyers to agree on legal fees caps.With about 200 election-related cases anticipated in court, the commission could spend more than Sh1.2 billion in lawyers&rsquo; legal fees going by the rate paid in 2013.In 2013, the IEBC spent a staggering Sh568 million to pay lawyers who represented the commission in the presidential petition alone.The commission also paid a further Sh486 million for the 188 poll petitions for other elective positions in an unprecedented bill in legal fees that threatened its operations.Some of the huge payments for legal services were questioned by Auditor General Edward Ouko in his 2015-16 financial audit report tabled in Parliament early this year.Auditor questions paymentsIn the report, IEBC made double payments amounting to Sh2 billion for private legal services without the approval or prior concurrence of the Attorney General as required by law.The audit revealed that the commission used law firms that were not prequalified in violation of procurement laws.&ldquo;The commission paid Sh17.8 million to five law firms that were not prequalified and were single-sourced contrary to sections 78 to 85 ( 1 )(b) of the Public Procurement and Disposal Act, 2005,&rdquo; Ouko said in his report.There have been concerns that some rogue lawyers drag election cases in court to maximise on appearance fees at the expense of taxpayers.Yesterday, Kisumu Town West MP Olago Oluoch urged the IEBC to strike an agreement with lawyers taking up election petitions and agree on modest legal fees.&ldquo;It is not too late. We need a cap, especially on presidential petitions, to make costs manageable,&rdquo; the lawyer told the Star.
