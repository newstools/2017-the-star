At least 70,000 children are severely malnourished in Kenya, according to a new survey. The survey released yesterday showed alarming malnutrition rates in Turkana, East Pokot, Mandera, Samburu and West Pokot counties. Patrick Mweki, the Action Against Hunger director for Kenya and Somalia, yesterday said the overall nutrition situation continues to deteriorate and has worsened in some counties. “The situation is likely to worsen as we enter the lean and short rains season. The just-concluded General Election must be used as an opportunity to reverse the hunger tragedy unfolding in many parts of the country. We urge the new national and county governments to act now to prevent children from dying,” he said while releasing the study in Nairobi. The survey showed that in Turkana alone, severe malnutrition rates are up from 2.3 per cent to 8.3 per cent, nearly four-fold in just one year. “In Turkana South, an unprecedented 12 per cent of children under five now suffer from severe acute malnutrition. These counties have also witnessed extreme deterioration in nutrition and food security,” the survey said. The assessments also revealed alarmingly high, severe, acute malnutrition rates in East Pokot at 5.8 per cent, 5.2 per cent in Mandera, 3.8 per cent in Samburu and 3.2 per cent in West Pokot. The assessment was conducted by the county departments of health, Unicef and nine aid organisations working on the ground, including Save the Children. Francis Woods, Save the Children’s Interim country director, called on the national and local governments dealing with drought response to prioritise critical funds and support, including food programmes, to reach the most vulnerable and prevent needless deaths. The drought has left tens of thousands of children and families vulnerable.
