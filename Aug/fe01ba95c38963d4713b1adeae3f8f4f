A splinter group of Njuri Ncheke has said they will slaughter a sheep and perform rituals to cleanse a shrine after "unfit elders defile it" before paying fine after they were excommunicated. A section of Njuri Ncheke elders on Tuesday stormed their headquarters in Nchiru and forced their way into the shrine after they were barred from entering by a splinter group. The faction, led by secretary general Josephat Murangiri, who convened in the shrine on Wednesday in an urgent meeting, said the "unfit elders sinned". He said they should not step in the shrine before they pay a fine called "Mirongo Itatu" and are cleansed. "They are not Njuri elders they are still 'Ncege' until they pay the fine. We cursed them and even 'buried' them outside the shrine until they pay the fine then we can 'resurrect' them," Murangiri said Among those "cursed" by the Murangiri faction are chairman Paul M'ithinkia, secretary general Phares Rutere, Lands CS Jacob Kaimenyi and Chuka University VC Erastus Njoka. The group, led by Rutere and M’ithinkia organised for a convoy of vehicles to enter the shrine on Tuesday. They were barred by a faction led by Murangiri and Kathera. Rutere in his address on Tuesday said those elders who had been leading through the backdoor should be told the owners have "reclaimed the shrine". "We are extending an olive branch to them. They should join us so that we can work for the people. They were operating illegally, but we are ready to accommodate them, " Rutere said in the shrine, where he was accompanied by 50 elders.
