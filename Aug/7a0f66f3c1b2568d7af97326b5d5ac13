In a rare show of unity, Matuga MP winner Kassim Tandaza of ANC and NASA supporters joined Jubilee Governor Salim Mvurya’s supporters to celebrate at the School of Government, Kwale. Tandaza beat ODM’s Hassan Mwanyoha with 16,985 votes against 12,627 votes. Tandaza asked Kenyans to be peaceful as they await presidential results to be announced by the IEBC. “I urge Kenyans to be peaceful and see that can solve issues and not cause chaos,” he said after receiving his IEBC certificate. The MP-elect promised to ensure locals around Shimba Hills National Reserve benefit from the resource. “There was a law that sees locals jailed when found cutting poles but we can change it through a Bill that I will table in Parliament,” he said. He promised to table a Bill to lift the ban on export of cashew nuts so local growers and processors can benefit. “We have products like cocoa and tea which are exported, as  well as titanium,” Tandaza said. He promised to address the land issue and ensure those who used their land as collateral for loans from the Agricultural Finance Cooperation are assisted.
