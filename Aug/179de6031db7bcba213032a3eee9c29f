WITH information doing the rounds that the International
Criminal Court is closely monitoring the utterances and actions of opposition
politicians, a small bird has told Corridors that a senior a NASA opposition
leader has opted to keep off political activity. Following the declaration of the
Presidential results, the hitherto combative opposition leader has gone into
hibernation, putting his supporters in tenterhooks. His phones are said to be
off most of the time, as he strategises his next move. ******** TWO senior lawyers who never set foot in Kisii during the
entire campaign period were heard boasting how they delivered votes for Jubilee
in the region.  They have been telling everyone one who cares to listen
that were it not for their “political tactics and input”, the President’s party
would have emerged with nothing. But for those in the know, the real
campaigners in Kisii will not shout out – as they are state officers. ******** A day after the Star reported that President Uhuru Kenyatta will drop lazy and non-performing
Cabinet Secretaries in his new Cabinet lineup, a CS who feels he could be on
the chopping list has hurriedly constituted a lobby group made up of
elders and professionals from his community to pile pressure on the President
to spare him. It is, however, said the die is cast as politicians from his
county have proposed a new name to replace him, once the Cabinet is
reconstituted. It is said the man has been antagonising the politicians, who
pushed for his appointment in 2013. ******* IS former Presidential ‘candidate’ Kennedy Mong’are in a political free-fall, or did the immediate former
Nyamira Senator chew more than he could swallow? Well, the senator, who bungled
his initial presidential bid and instead unsuccessfully contested the county
governorship, is now eying an MCA position. The senator, known for his deep
pockets, has started serious lobbying amongst MCAs-elect as he positions
himself for the influential position of the Nyamira County Assembly Speaker. ******** DID NASA bungle its own adopt-a-polling-station strategy
that could have protected its votes across the country? Corridors of Power has
learnt that the opposition has failed to rollout the much-hyped strategy
following financial constraints after a key financier withheld some Sh250
million that was meant to pay agents three days to Election Day. This was a
major setback on NASA’s plan, with claims that the earmarked agents crossed
over to Jubilee, where they were handsomely paid a day to the polls. ******** IS the Inspector General of Police aware of a
long-serving Traffic officer harassing motorists at the Ntulele Traffic check
point? The officer is said to have been transferred to the base 10 years ago.
