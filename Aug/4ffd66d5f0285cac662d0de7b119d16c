Ol Kalou MP David Kiaraho has recaptured his seat. He garnered 37,502 votes. His only rival, independent candidate George Wambugu, got 19,727 votes. Speaking after he was declared winner on Wednesday night, Kiaraho gave a contradicting speech. He welcomed his rival to work with him and on the other vowed never to forgive Wambugu for allegedly perpetuating dirty propaganda and lies during the campaigns. “It has not been easy. You know how far we have come. There is a man I was contesting with. He troubled me so much,” he said “One thing I must ask him is to come closer so we can work together, despite all the propaganda this gentleman spread.” Wambugu was aggressively involved in water projects, where two boreholes were drilled in Kandutura and Kanjuiri villages, and Karugutu Dam was desilted. On Monday, he told the media the projects were donor-funded and he was only invited to launch them. Kiaraho said it was wrong for Wambugu to pretend he was behind the projects to win votes. Kiaraho said he has no grudge against his opponent. He said Wambugu is welcome to contribute to the development of Ol Kalou.
