Incumbent Peter Munya has disputed the Meru governor results. He said there was ‘computerised rigging’ to make Jubilee candidate Kiraitu Murungi win. “We are back to the old Kanu days when elections were stolen against the people’s will. We will join other forces to reject the 2017 results,” Munya said yesterday. He continued, “We want to tell the people who voted for us that what we are experiencing is not a free and fair election. During the Kanu days, it was done manually, but rigging is now computerised.” Munya said there was a pattern of results that did not make sense. “It is questionable for the Jubilee candidate for Meru to get 54 per cent, the governor for Machakos 54 and for Kajiado 54 per cent. It is not a coincidence,” he said.
