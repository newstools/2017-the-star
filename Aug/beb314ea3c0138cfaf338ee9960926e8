Trouble is brewing again at the National Olympic Committee of Kenya with Kenya Rowing &amp; Canoe Association (KRCA) threatening to block the forthcoming elections unless their pending grievances are addressed.The association through secretary general James Mweu Maingi, has voiced their concern over non-recognition by the Sports Registrar, Rose Wasike and Nock executive, who have instead gone ahead to endorse rival group that was alleged voted out during the elections held in March, 2015 in line with the 2013 Sports Act where the new constitution was adopted.In a letter copied to Cabinet Secretary in the Ministry of Sports, Culture &amp; Arts, Principal Secretary Peter Kaberia, Kenya National Sports Council (KNSC), Centre for Multi Party Democracy (CMD) and Nock affiliates, Mweu said it was pointless to hold elections if the winners are not recognized. The association spokesman blamed both the Sports Registrar and Nock secretary general FK Paul in particular, for recognizing a group that was blacklisted and voted out during KRCA last elections. But contacted for comment, the Sports Registrar Rose Wasike said she is not aligned to any sports discipline, adding that her work is to regulate and remain fair in her decision.Nock secretary general, FK Paul, however, told Mweu to stop misleading the public since his team did not conduct official elections. &ldquo; Mweu&rsquo;s group held their own private elections that were not sanctioned and we did not endorse them. I advised him to liaise with the other group and come up with credible elections and from there, we can work on the way forward,&rdquo; added PaulMweu accused Nock of frustrating them and undermining their existence. &ldquo;Nock have continued to work with the black-listed members and even recommended them to the International federations thereby undermining the elected officials. Our rankings have gone down since we have been denied a chance to participate in International and Olympic qualifiers event from 2011 up to date,&rdquo; observed Mweu.The association spokesman has vowed to go to court and stop the forthcoming Nock elections until their nagging issues are addressed.
