International election observers conducted themselves in a suspect manner, raising questions about their objectivity, Muslim clerics at the Coast have said. Kenya Muslim National Advisory Council yesterday said they have no faith in the observers. “We condemn them. They were quick to support the Jubilee win without considering key issues raised,” Kemnac chairman, Juma Ngao, said. He continued, “They were more keen on the process of voting, which was peaceful and we agree. But they did not look into the transmission of results, which is where the problem was.” He spoke to the Star on the phone. The cleric, who is also the PNU national vice chairman, said the way the international observers conducted themselves after voting does not inspire confidence. “They should come out and be open to Kenyans, who deserve truth and justice,” Ngao said. One of the observers - the Carter Center - that sent former US secretary of state John Kerry to lead a team of other observers, has called for a probe into the failures in the results transmission system. In a report dated August 10, the centre said there were significant instances where the electoral code of conduct was ignored. Most election observers said the elections were free and fair and called on those aggrieved to seek legal redress. NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga has refused to concede defeat and believes his victory has been stolen.
