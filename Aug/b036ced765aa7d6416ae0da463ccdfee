Former nominated Senator Emma Mbura blamed her opponents for using propaganda that hurt her chances of winning the Rabai parliamentary seat. She said her rivals portrayed her as a person who lives  in Mombasa. “They said I stay in Mombasa and I will abandon the Rabai people once they elect me. People believed that ,” Mbura told the Star on the phone yesterday. Mbura (Maendeleo Chap Chap) lost the race to the incumbent, William Kamoti (ODM). She said , however, the loss was part of her learning curve in her first attempt in the male-dominated field. “I managed to erase the notion that Mijikenda women cannot lead. There is a stereotype that  women in Kilifi think leadership belongs to men. I’m relaxed. I have no pressure. This is politics. Some lose others win,” said Mbura.
