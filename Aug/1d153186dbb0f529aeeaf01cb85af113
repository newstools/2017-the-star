LPK leader  Ababu Namwamba was defeated in his bid to retain the Budalang’i MP seat. The race attracted five aspirants. Namwamba garnered 10,784 votes against ODM Sauti Wanjala’s 12,757, Andrew Nakitare’s 2,989, Jubilee aspirant Mediatrice Wangira ‘s 1,536 votes, David Obara’s 330 votes and Ford Kenya’s Deogratius Adundo’s 112. Wanjala’s victory proved wrong Namwamba’s allegation that ODM is dead. He yesterday thanked residents for voting for him after receiving his certificate from Budalang’i IEBC coordinator Peter Tiyo at the Bunyala sub-county headquarters. Wanjala assured residents he will serve without bias.
