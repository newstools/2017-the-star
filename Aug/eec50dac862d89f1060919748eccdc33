PSCU director of messaging Eric Ng'eno has blasted NASA co-principal Musalia Mudavadi, terming him a serial propagandist.Ng'eno on Thursday said Mudavadi has changed from being a "colourless politician" to becoming a "reckless, habitual liar"."Without regard for plausibility, probability and believability, Mudavadi has energetically plied the world with shameless figments of the most outlandish order, causing widespread concern about his welfare," he said.The director was responding to Mudavadi's statement in which he said President Uhuru Kenyatta was wrong on his win and the number of seats the Jubilee party has won in the just concluded general election.The NASA co-principal claimed Jubilee's victory in the August 8 general election is a product of organised crime.Mudavadi claimed Jubilee committed "high crimes" to get into office, adding it has been the trend since the 2007 general election.[STATEMENT] NASA giving Supreme Court second chance, Raila says on electionBut Ng'eno said Mudavadi has ruined whatever credibility he had left by allowing his name to be used in a divisive agenda."Apart from marveling at the stupendous lies Mudavadi has proved capable of serially surpassing time after time, the reflective observer must also wonder what's becoming of the Mudavadi we thought we knew," he said.NASA has filed a petition at the Supreme Court challenging President Uhuru Kenyatta's win.The Court has gagged both parties against making remarks on the matter.
