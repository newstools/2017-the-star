Two leading contenders for the position of Kisii county assembly speaker have quit. Former speaker Kerosi Ondieki and Nyaribari Masaba MP candidate Ocharo Kebira said they are not keen on the race. Candidates from South Mugirango and Bonchari have been tipped as favourites. The election is scheduled for Thursday. Ondieki said he pulled out because his family is uncomfortable with the position following his many run-ins with the administration. “I want to thank the people for giving me an opportunity to serve them as speaker and the tremendous support amid wrangles. I will continue to support Governor James Ongwae and his government,” he told the Star on the phone. Ondieki urged the MCAs to elect a person of integrity. “The MCAs should go for someone who is able to interpret the law,” he said. Joshua Ondora, who lost the South Mugirango MP race, is the latest entrant alongside Jon Billy Momanyi who lost the Bonchari MP race. Ondora and Momanyi ran on the ODM ticket. They have been reaching out to MCAs to support their bids. “I was part of the ODM team that delivered the current leadership. To drive our agenda, I decided to contest the speaker seat. I have what it takes to be speaker and I have networks across the county,” Ondora, an advocate and businessman, said. Kisii South Knut executive secretary Geoffrey Mogire is being prevailed upon to withdraw his candidature. Nyacheki MCA Caleb Ong’uti, a Nairobi-based advocate, has also declared his interest. “I’m the race for the seat of speaker even though my counterparts have resolved to support me for the deputy speaker post,” he told the Star on phone. If Ong’uti is elected, the people of Nyacheki will go for a by-election to elect a new ward representative.
