Governor Evans Kidero and Mike Sonko are reaching out to communities for endorsements as campaigns for the hotly contested Nairobi governor seat enter the home straight.The two, who are the main contenders for the seat, have been endorsed by at least five communities in the last week.The communities are seen as the largest vote blocs in the city and a candidate who controls them has a clear chance of winning.Last week, Sonko, who is running on the Jubilee ticket, got the backing of &ldquo;elders and leaders&rdquo; from the Luhya, Kisii and Kamba communities.Kidero was installed as an elder by Kisii leaders at Kasarani stadium on Friday. On Saturday, the Kambas threw their weight behind the city boss and Deputy Governor Jonathan Mueke, an event that was attended by outgoing Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama.On Sunday, more than 2,000 members of the Luhya community reaffirmed their support for Kidero's candidature, just a day after leaders from the same community declared their support for Sonko.Interestingly, some faces that were seen at Sonko's endorsements were also at Kidero's.Whether the endorsements are genuine and whether they will sway members of these community to vote in a particular direction will only be seen on August 8.Political analysts, however, are divided about this strategy. Some say endorsements are healthy as they create perceptions and even sway the undecided voters to vote in a particular way. However, this is only if the endorsements are done by genuine opinion leaders.But others argue that the rubber-stamping of politicians by communities is done by &ldquo;a few people who are out to mint money from desperate politicians." &ldquo;People have already made up their minds. These (people endorsing politicians on behalf of communities) are machineries and scavengers who are exploiting a certain trend,&rdquo; political analyst and communication expert Barrack Muluka said.Jubilee Nairobi chairman Sanctus Ndegwa said their candidate does not rely on endorsements as most of the communities doing the endorsing are &ldquo;NASA friendly.&rdquo; &ldquo;Honestly, most of these communities will vote for the NASA candidate. If you look at the Kamba, the community is in NASA, and if we are to get votes from them, then it will be a very small margin," he said. Latest opinion polls by research firms have shown that NASA has a massive following in the capital, especially from the Luhya, Kamba, Luhya and Kisii communities, key vote blocs that Kidero is banking on to win reelection.
