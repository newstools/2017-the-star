The president has admitted that he is happy for his ex-girlfriend, Michelle Yola fater a public and bitter break-up. “If God hasn’t written it, it won’t turn out the way you want it to. I believe that life is a learning curve and if one door closes, another one opens. Some things will happen and make you feel heartbroken but maybe it could turn out to be a blessing in disguise,” Prezzo told Word Is when asked how he felt now that his ex-girlfriend Yola was seeing a mzungu. Adding, "I have gotten over her already. I keep myself very busy. I just hope and pray that she is good where she is.” He went on to clarify that he is not seeing anyone and was not willing to jump into another relationship anytime soon. “No, I’m not seeing anybody right now, and I’m not really in a rush.” Prezzo said So what about the tattoo he had put on his hand write Yola? “The tattoo stays because you have to understand that when i was getting this tattoo she was a very big part of my life.We dated for life two and a half years an the problems that i came across she was the only one there for me.Me saying I'm gonna remove the tattoo because she has another man is petty and immature.” Prezzo is currently working on releasing songs after elections and has done a couple of collabos with Tanzania artistes among them Joh Makini, Mr Blue, and Baraka The Prince.
