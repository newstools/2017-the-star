Plastic bags are causing more harm than good to Kenya&rsquo;s economy, the Vision 2030 Secretariat has said.A ban on light-weight bags goes into effect on August 28.The secretariat&rsquo;s director general Julius Muia yesterday defended the ban. He said the government would rather allocate resources at a national level to something else that can create jobs sustainably.&ldquo;If you switch those resources to areas of the economy, where you can have better multiplier effects than producing something harmful to the economy, you are better off as a country,&rdquo; he said.Muia dismissed claims the ban move will render people jobless instead.He urged manufacturers to adopt new and cleaner technologies.His sentiments were echoed by UN Environment Programme Executive Director Erik Solheim (pictured), who said plastics have dire consequences on health, the economy and environment. Solheim said plastics kill wildlife when they ingest them. They also disintegrate in water where they are eaten by fish before coming back to our tables.&ldquo;Tourism is very important in the Kenyan economy and no one wants to go to a national park, where plastic are floating around,&rdquo; he said.The two spoke at the Tribe Hotel, Nairobi, during the signing of an MoU between the UN and Safaricom.Safaricom will use its market strength to educate Kenyans on the environment.Safaricom CEO Bob Collymore said the company is using woven natural fibre bags as alternatives to plastic.
