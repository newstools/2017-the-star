The cold-blooded murder of three people in Ayany, Nairobi, has sparked off a series of accusations and counter-accusations, with the police claiming the three were robbers.But a family member of one of the murdered youths said it was a clear case of extrajudicial killing.The three were ordered out of their vehicle on the estate just minutes after picking up a young woman who was a childhood friend.All the killed youths were between 22-25 years old.A cousin of one of the victims told the Star, &ldquo;One of them is my cousin (Mikey) and they were on their way back from picking up a friend at Fort Jesus when the officers stopped them and after ordering them to lie down they shot them. One of the officers goes by an alias &ndash; Blackie.&rdquo;The three were in a Mercedes Benz when they were ordered out and instructed to lie face down.&ldquo;The three were ordered out of the car by the policeman and even surrendered to the officers, but were shot at point blank range before the policeman fired more rounds in the air. People on the estate cowered in their homes during the shooting, which happened between 7pm and 8pm,&rdquo; the relative told the Star.The quiet middle-class home was jolted by the gunfire and scared residents only peeped out of their windows in fear. &ldquo;The group had been accused of stealing the car which my cousin owns and other baseless claims of carrying a body which was not found,&rdquo; the relative said.But Nairobi police boss Japheth Koome said the three had been on the police most wanted list for a series of theft reports in the city.He denied the young men and woman were killed for no reason.&ldquo;The public tipped our officers, who tried to arrest the group, but they resorted to opening fire at our people and the officers were forced to retaliate, leading to three fatalities and two others escaping,&rdquo; he said.He said two firearms with a number of bullets were recovered from the three.
