With only hours to the end of campaigning, Machakos governor candidates have resorted to mudslinging—it is no longer about manifestos. On Monday Governor Alfred Mutua said his rival Wavinya Ndeti in 2002 arrested for allegedly trafficking illegal substances. Speaking at a rally in Machakos, the governor said has a dossier indicating Ndeti and three other women were being pursued by Interpol and the US Drug Enforcement Agency. But Ndeti immediately released a statement and dismissed the claims. She accused Mutua of orchestrating propaganda ahead of Tuesday’s voting. Ndeti is seeking to unseat Mutua on the Wiper ticket. Mutua has, however, launched a vigorous campaign, especially in the last three weeks to retain his seat. He is running on the Maendeleo Chap Chap ticket, which he heads. Machakos governor is one of the hotly contested positions in this election. The NASA brigade, headed by its presidential candidate Raila Odinga, has held numerous campaigns in the region to boost Ndeti's bid. Mutua, on the other hand, has capitalised on his Maendeleo Chap Chap slogan to stifle the opposition. An opinion poll released on Tuesday by Tifa showed that Mutua is ahead with 59 per cent with Ndeti’s at 35 per cent. The Machakos governor post is seen as very crucial to NASA, losing it will be seen as a major weakness on Kalonzo Musyoka’s grip of Ukambani. Mutua has branded himself the new regional leader and declared he will run for president in 2022, a position Kalonzo, who is Raila’s running mate, is also eying. Yesterday, Mutua said Machakos cannot be led by people of questionable character, in apparent reference to Ndeti. “I know his plans. His first strategy was to defeat me in court. Plan B was to say I had planned to cause violence in Machakos county so that I be barred from contesting by the IEBC. Now he has started propaganda,” she said.
