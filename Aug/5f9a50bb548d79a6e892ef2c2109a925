Only four of 10 MCAs will head back to the Lamu assembly. They are Maendeleo Chap Chap’s James Komu (Hongwe), Safina’s Paul Kimani (Mkunumbi ), ODM’s Azhar Mbarak (Shella) and PDU’s Anthony Njomo (Bahari). Losers are Athman Mohamed of Witu, Omar Said of Kiunga, who didn’t defend his seat, Mohamed Delo of Basuba, Abbas Famau of Faza, Ali Bakari of Momani ward and Abdu Kassim, who vied for the Lamu East MP seat and lost. Only one woman has been elected MCA. Anab Haji, 37, of Jubilee, floored seven men to be represent Hindi. “My victory is my people’s victory,” she said.
