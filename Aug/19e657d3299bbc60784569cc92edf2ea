The race for Kajiado county assembly speaker has attracted drama as aspirants trade accusations over their abilities to lead. Former Oloosirkon-Sholinke MCA Daniel Kanchori said he reads malice in the way an opponent is being groomed by a prominent politician to take over. On Sunday, Kanchori claimed former speaker Johnson Osoi is being pushed by a Kajiado South politician to defend his seat and yet he had “withdrawn” from the race “long ago”. “There is an attempt by a few selfish leaders and cartels to endorse Osoi, who they will manipulate as a speaker. I urge all MCAs to stand firm and make their own independent decisions,” he said. “Osoi failed to unite the past assembly where he ran his own Kitchen Cabinet of a few MCAs to discriminate on others. This must not happen [again].” But yesterday, Osoi told the Star no one is pushing him to run for the post. “Those opposed to me are scared because of my exemplary and unequalled record of professional management of the county assembly,” he said. Outgoing Narok county secretary Samuel Seki also wants to be speaker.
