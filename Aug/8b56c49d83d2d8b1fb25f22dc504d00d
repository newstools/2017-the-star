The Kenya Human Rights Commission has moved to court seeking to suspend the cancellation of its operation certificate over allegations of tax evasion. KHRC said the decision by the NGOs Board to cancel its certificate is gross violation to fair hearing, and wants it to be overturned. The commission said it received a letter from the board on August 14, which said its certificate will be canceled. KHRC said the move is prejudicial and illegal. It also said the action is damaging its image as an internationally renown human rights organisation. “The petitioner's image as an internationally renown human rights organisation is bound to suffer because the respondent has sensationally and maliciously associated it with tax evasion, money laundering, misappropriation and embezzlement of donor funds,” read the suit papers in part. KHRC said that before the cancellation, it was not given opportunity to be heard. It added that if the certificate is cancelled, there is a possibility that its actions will be grounded. KHRC was accused of operating four illegal bank accounts. According to the NGO Board, KHRC failed to also pay taxes amounting to Sh100 million to Kenya Revenue Authority, and has allegedly hired expatriates without valid work permits. However, KHRC defended itself, saying as a leading human rights organisation in the country, it maintains the highest levels of financial and operational integrity, the same it demands of public authorities whom it seeks to hold to account. KHRC was registered in 1994. It was formed by Prof Makau Mutua, Maina Kiai, Dr Willy Mutunga, Kiraitu Murungi and Prof Peter Kareithi. It has always been at the forefront in fighting injustices varying from issues of gender equality, extrajudicial killings, democracy, human dignity to social justice. Its trouble began immediately after August 8 General Election.
