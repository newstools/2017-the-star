Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati will streamline every department in the county government. Wangamati, who will be sworn in today, made the remarks in his acceptance speech at Kibabii University in Kanduyi constituency on Friday. Hundreds of Bungoma residents attended the event. “I promise to be fair to all and will not discriminate. I promise to serve with humility, character and conviction. I will take responsibility and be accountable to all. I will make stern decisions, but I will also listen more and learn more,” he said. He will not tolerate corrupt officers in his government. The businessman beat Jubilee point man in the Western region Kenneth Lusaka (Ford Kenya) with 20,000 votes. Three other politicians, Alfred Khang’ati of ODM, Stephen Mutoro of ANC and Jimmy Nduruchi, an independent candidate, were in the race. “The task of changing Bungoma is yours and mine. I will do my part, please do yours,” he added. Wangamati, who was accompanied by his wife Caroline and their three children, thanked residents and Ford Kenya for having faith in him. “I am under no illusion about the task ahead. It is a great responsibility which I can accomplish with your support,” Wangamati said. His deputy Charles Ngome, MPs Wafula Wamunyinyi, Eseli Simiyu, James Mukwe and woman rep Catherine Wambilianga attended the function.
