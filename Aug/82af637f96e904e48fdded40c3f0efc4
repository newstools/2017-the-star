Kiambu Governor-elect Ferdinand Waititu's searing-in ceremony is being held in Ndumberi, Kiambu town, today. Residents have said they have high expectations that Waititu will deliver on his promises. Resident John Njau said they voted in a new governor because outgoing Governor William Kabogo "oppressed them". "I expect Waititu to lower licence fees, promise the businesspeople that they will not be oppressed and also tell us that his government will listen to our problems," he said. Trader Mirriam Mukami said they expect the Waititu-led administration to have an open-door policy and not to be focused on politics. "We need to see work being done on the ground," she said. County secretary Fredrick Kitema told the Star said the inauguration ceremony's budget focuses only on the basics. There has been a public outcry over the huge budgets set aside for the governors' inauguration ceremonies.
