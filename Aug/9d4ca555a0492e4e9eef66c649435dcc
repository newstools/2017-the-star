Kenya has installed Modern Automatic Weather Observing System(AWOS) at three international airports within the country making it an inch closer to launching direct flights to the United states of America.The Sh200 million systems have so far been installed at Jomo Kenyatta, Kisumu and Eldoret International Airports.This was among the 10 international category one standards required to allow for the direct flights from Kenya to USA.Environment Cabinet Secretary Judi Wakhungu (pictured) said the installation of AWOS has put Kenya at par with other destinations with international airports across the world.Wakhungu said they are working closely with the Ministry of Transport to ensure that the entire requirement needed is met.&ldquo;I have talked with our counterparts from the Ministry of Transport and they are optimistic that the direct flights might be introduced by December this year after all the requirements needed are met,&rdquo; she said.Speaking while commissioning the system at Kisumu International Airport, the CS said the observing system shall carry out meteorological observation, air humidity, dew point temperature, precipitation, solar radiation and thunderstorms.&ldquo;Whereas the standard observations are made every hour, this system has a high temporal resolution and provides information every 10 minutes, which is automatically transmitted to an office computer from where analysis is carried out. Additionally the system is able to monitor strong cross winds or wind gust at the airport.&rdquo;Expansion of Kisumu International Airport runway and installation of the system at the facility and Eldoret International Airport has paved way for direct international flights to the two airports.This shall decongest Jomo Kenyatta International Airport and open up Kisumu and Eldoret International Airports which are underutilised.&ldquo;Since the runaway was moved from its ordinal position in an effort to extend it, currently the extension has enabled the air port receive large crafts hence the new equipment will enhance observation making it safer for landing and taking off of aircrafts, &ldquo;said the CSThe government, she said was taking weather forecasting seriously and will endeavour to modernize the Kenya Meteorological Department to ensure that it relays accurate and timely weather information.&ldquo;The government recognizes the importance of providing accurate weather information and has earmarked, as priority in this financial year,&rdquo; said Wakhungu.
