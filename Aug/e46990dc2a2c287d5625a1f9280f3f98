It also ranked highly in the first quarter of the year after settling 81.4 per cent of all its claims.AAR Insurance attributed this improved claim settlement to the efficient working of the IT system deployed in 2014 and re-engineered last year to improve processes.AAR Insurance managing director Caroline Munene said the company was leveraging on technology to improve its efficiency in claim settlement to cater to the requirements of its customers in their time of distress.&ldquo;Our Sh100 million investment in a new IT system is starting to pay off.

She added that the firm was continuously re-engineering the claims management process to provide faster solutions to its customers and that the firm&rsquo;s goal was to further improve claim settlement to an average of about 95 per cent of total claims by end of 2018 as a way of inspiring client satisfaction and improving service.AAR Insurance has over 120,000 customers and 10 branches across the country.
