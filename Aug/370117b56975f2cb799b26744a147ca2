They say you're only as good as the company you keep - which in the case of this baby elephant is very good company indeed. This is the heart-warming moment a herd of elephants came to the aid of a youngster who had slipped into a watering hole inÂ South Africa. The incredible video was taken by Rudi at the Addo Elephants park, in South Africa, in July this year. It shows the elephants scramble to the edge of the water to rescue the baby who had slipped down the ledge while taking a drink. The elephants scramble to pull the baby up the slippery bank with their trunks, struggling with the task for several minutes. But eventually they manage to get their long noses behind the calf like a cradle and pull it to safety. Rudi, who was with his wife and two children at the time, said: 'He or she tried to take a drink from the edge and slipped down the ledge. "We where horrified, we knew that if he drowned and there would be absolutely nothing we could do about it. "I have never seen anything like that before, and I can only assume never again."
