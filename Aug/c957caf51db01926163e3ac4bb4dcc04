Migori MCAs paid a heavy price for poor performance as 82 per cent of them were sent packing by voters. MCAs faced several demonstrations at the assembly premises by youths, women and people living with disability for not passing bills to support them. Migori county has 40 wards. Of the 11 MCAs, 10 were elected reps, while one was a nominated MCA in the outgoing assembly. The outgoing assembly had 12 nominated MCAs. Constituencies where voters sent home their entire MCAs teams included Suna East, Rongo and Kuria East. “Voters were disappointed by the work of the last assembly as there was no bill passed that impacted on them,” communication lecturer at Kisii University Nick Oluoch said yesterday.
