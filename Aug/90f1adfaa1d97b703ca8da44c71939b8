Kakamega Governor
Wycliffe Oparanya has retained his seat. Oparanya
was declared winner by county returning officer Grace Rono after garnering
387,999 votes against his closest rival, outgoing Senator Boni Khalwale. Khalwale, who ran on the Ford
Kenya ticket, got 134, 999 votes. Cleophas
Malala of ANC won the senator race with 258,178 votes against
ODM’s Seth Panyako's 198,602. Trade executive Elsie Muhanda of ODM was declared winner of the women
representative race with 341,880 votes, beating ANC’s Lydia Nyangala, who got
134,324 votes. Though
ODM retained the governor and woman rep seats, it lost several MP seats due to the NASA sibling rivalry. Only two out six ODM MPs were reelected. Musalia Mudavadi’s ANC was the biggest winner. It bagged
five of the 12 MP seats, followed by Jubilee with four, ODM with two, while Ford
Kenya got one. In
his acceptance speech, Oparanya said his victory was a testimony that the
people of Kakamega have confidence in his leadership. He promised to even do
better in his second term. “I
hope we’ll work together as elected leaders for the benefit of the people of
Kakamega,” Oparanya said. Oparanya and Khalwale
had a frosty relationship since their election to office as governor and
senator in 2013. They ended up on the ballot to settle
scores. Malala urged Oparanya to hire NASA candidates in his county executive committee.
