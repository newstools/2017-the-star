Jubilee’s Joseph ole Lenku yesterday was leading in Kajiado’s provisional governor results against incumbent David Nkedianye of ODM. Lenku was leading with 150,966 votes against Nkedianye’s 124,763. Daniel Nina of PNU garnered 3,476 votes. Nkedianye, who has been winning prior mock polls, was taken aback, as Lenku went on bashing him across all the five constituencies. By yesterday morning, Lenku led Nkedianye by a wide margin. Philip Mpayeei of JP was way ahead of Daniel Tinaayi of ODM in the Senate race. Tinaayi, who has also led Mpayeei in Infotrak and Ipsos polls for three months, was also taken aback. Provisional results still streaming in indicated Mpayeei was leading with 148,039 votes against Tinaayi’s 117,599 votes. Jason Parantai of Wiper was third with 8,333 votes. Paul Paitah was fourth with 4,093. In the woman representative race, JP’s Janet Teyiaa was leading with 159,941 votes against her rival Esther Somoire of ODM with 89,147 votes. Simayiai Rakita of Wiper won 16,354 votes. For Parliament, George Sunkuyia (JP) was leading in Kajiado West, as Elijah Memusi of ODM took an early lead in Kajiado Central. Katoo ole Metito was headed to win the Kajiado South seat. Joseph Manje of JP in Kajiado North was far in the lead and appeared certain to reclaim his seat. MP Peris Tobiko of JP was ahead of her close contender Kakuta Maimai of ODM in Kajiado East. In the MCA race, some of the big losers included Samuel Kipaika of JP, who lost to little-known Daniel Naikuni of ODM in Purko ward. MCA Joseph Mutunkei of JP was trounced by Samuel Teum of Wiper. Wiper candidate Amos Peshut stole the show in Imaroro ward and sent home Timothy Sayiore of JP.
