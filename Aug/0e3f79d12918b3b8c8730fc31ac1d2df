Jubilee Party has resolved to appeal the decision of the Political Parties Disputes Tribunal to reject its nomination party list. This was done on grounds that it violated the law in picking representatives of marginalised groups. President Uhuru Kenyatta’s (pictured) JP, ODM and Kanu’s lists were nullified on Tuesday and the parties directed to reconstitute them to comply with the law. Officials of the three parties met yesterday to look at the tribunal’s ruling before agreeing on their next course of action. The nullification came a fortnight after the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission published the names of persons all parties nominated to the National Assembly, the Senate and the county assemblies. JP communications officer Albert Memusi yesterday told the Star that they will appeal because the party did not violate any law. He said they widely consulted before coming up with the list. “The tribunal’s decision is an opinion which we respect. However, based on the reasons we had given on fair representation and why we put those people on the list, we are appealing. We hope the courts will listen to what we are appealing against,” Memusi said. The tribunal directed the party to remove lawyer Jeniffer Shamala from National Assembly nominees for failing to disclose the special interest group she represents ad reconstitute the listof nominees for the Murang’a and Laikipia county assemblies. In both counties, the ruling said it did not comply with the need for gender, marginalised people and ethnic representation.
