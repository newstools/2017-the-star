The people of Laikipia want peace and not violence.The Laikipia Farmers Association in a statement yesterday said the task of rebuilding the area must start after several months of lawlessness that led to losses of millions of shillings"The people of Laikipia voted overwhelmingly for peace and rejected violence in the August 8 General Election," chairman Martin Evans said.He said in recent months have been "extremely painful for Laikipia, both in terms of human suffering with many lives lost and grave damage to the economy"."The association's members are thrilled by the outcome of the election and we look forward to working with all the newly elected officials to rebuild our county," he said.Evans said the politicians who lost orchestrated invasions.He said voters resoundingly rejected the strategy of incitement&ndash; but the inciters must not be allowed to enjoy impunity nor have the chance to ever resume public office.Former controversial MP Mathew Lempurkel was floored by Sarah Korere.She garnered 10,767 votes against the Lempurkel's 7,686 votes.Korere was vying on the Jubilee ticket while Lempurkel was an ODM candidate.Lempurkel faces a battery of criminal cases including those relating to assault, threatening to burn down a police station and for inciting racial contempt.Some of these cases will be heard in September. He is also being investigated for alleged fraud.Evans said Laikipia&rsquo;s economy may have suffered losses topping an estimated four billion shillings due to the invasions so far."As Laikipia&rsquo;s largest employers, taxpayers and private contributors to social welfare, LFA members wish to offer their significant resources and skills to assist leaders in their plans to develop the economy and provide fresh investments that will create jobs,"he said.LFA is currently compiling accurate data on the loss of life, injury, arson, vandalism of property and environment, livestock theft and the massive losses for businesses caused by the lawlessness.Evans said they are committed to help in the urgent task of rebuilding Laikipia from the ashes &ndash; but this cannot begin until peace returns."The LFA extends the hand of friendship to all communities and welcomes calls for reconciliation. There is still a critical need for security agencies to restore law and order across Laikipia where gunmen continue to inflict havoc on communities".He said herders with thousands of cattle are still invading smallholder farms, ranches and conservancies, on the excuse of drought despite the onset of rains many weeks ago.
