A 60-year-old watchman was butchered on Wednesday by an unknown number of thugs who raided a soda shop in Bungoma town. Juma Baraza from Kakamega county is said to have worked there for seven years. "He was cut in the neck with a sharp object. The thieves carried crates of plastic-bottle sodas in a vehicle," said Bungoma South OCPD David Kirui. Neighbours told journalists the criminals armed with crude weapons also took Sh1,800. They raided the store owned by Bwake MCA Rosemary Khisa at about 4am. Kirui said gang must have killed the old man to conceal their identity. He said no suspect has been arrested but that they are following leads. The police boss asked members of the public to give them information that could lead to the arrest of the killers. Juma's family, led by his two widows, son and his brother, went to the scene.
