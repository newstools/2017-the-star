Political parties are keen to reward election losers with nominations to the Arusha-based East African Legislative Assembly as another round of lobbying kicks off. Some of the big guns who lost in the August 8 General Election are already angling for the nine slots available for Kenya at the regional Parliament. There were claims that Jubilee deliberately put roadblocks at the tail-end of the 11th Parliament to delay the election of EALA members. NASA had accused President Uhuru Kenyatta’s party of scuttling the process with a litany of technical hitches so they could reward losers. Yesterday, the Star established a galaxy of influential leaders who lost in the polls - both in Jubilee and NASA - are lining themselves up to seize the nine positions. “We are consulting widely on this matter, but we shall give communication in due time once the next Parliament is inaugurated this Thursday,” a top Jubilee official aware of the developments said. It emerged Jubilee will exploit the EALA nominations by dishing out rewards to regions that overwhelmingly voted for the President’s party in the polls. Jubilee, which is entitled to five slots, is toying with the idea of overhauling the previous list of 15 nominees and instead table the exact names as did ODM and Wiper. Former Budalang’i MP Ababu Namwamba, former CIC chairman Charles Nyachae and former National Assembly clerk Justin Bundi are some of the big names being floated by Jubilee.
