After days of violent protests over the presidential results, most people in Kisumu went about their business on Monday, even after Nasa leader Raila Odinga called for a work boycott. The lakeside town had in the past few days remained deserted. A spot check by the Star found most supermarkets have re-opened, and business is picking up gradually as traders count their losses. “Any acts of lawlessness, such as looting and destruction of property, will be dealt with squarely,” county commissioner Mohamed Maalim said. Maalim urged residents who travelled upcountry during voting to return to the town and carry on with their businesses, saying security is guaranteed. County Business Commission chairman Israel Agina expressed confidence that business will continue to thrive, after the losses caused by the protests.
