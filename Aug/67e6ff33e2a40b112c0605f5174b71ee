A litany of election petitions are expected after several losers in Kisii county rejected results released by the IEBC. Zaheer Jhanda who ran for Nyaribari Chache and Migos Ogamba of Kitutu Chache North rejected the outcome. “I’m weighing my options with a view of seeking redress in court. There was massive manipulation and voter bribery across the constituency. The people voted and we must give them leadership,” said ODM’s Ogamba, a Nairobi-based lawyer. Ogamba was beaten by Jimmy Angwenyi of JP with 16, 121 votes against 6, 786. Jhanda termed the results an “outright robbery”.  “The people of Nyaribari defied religion, clans and race to vote for me. Their will must be respected,” he said.  Jhanda lost to Nyagaka Tong’i who garnered 14, 140 votes against 11, 710. Jhanda claimed his agents in the entire Kiogoro ward were bribed. Tong’i said he won fairly. Jubilee’s Patrick Osero who lost his bid for Borabu MP to Wiper’s Ben Momanyi said he will challenge the results. Other candidates who might contest the polls outcome in court are former Bomachoge Chache MP Joel Onyancha and Zebedeo Opore of Bonchari.
