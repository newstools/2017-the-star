Trans Nzoia county officials yesterday roughed up a journalist and tried to destroy her phone for recording a confrontation as they prepared for the swearing in of Governor Patrick Khaemba. Star newspaper journalist Corazon Wafula was roughed up by county officials for taking a picture of a woman who had tried to cause a commotion. The woman had forcibly attempted to sing when the county reinforcement officers stepped in and dragged her away. A county worker said, “If you allow this girl here she will embarrass us when the governor arrives.” Tried to delete videos and photos The journalist tried to take footage using her phone, but the officers, including the governor’s bodyguards, roughed her up, took away the phone and tried to delete photos and videos. When they were unsuccessful, they threw it on the ground. It took the intervention of other journalists to restrain the officials from harassing her. The drama unfolded before the governor arrived. One county worker was heard shouting at the journalist, “Delete the video, or else I’m going to slap you. You people will not spoil our day.” Reporter threatened Other journalists thwarted attempts by the county officials to remove Wafula from the venue to stop her from covering the event. The officials vowed to deal with Wafula should she publish the assault. “We are going to deal with you if you publish the footage and how we have manhandled you,” one said. Police stepped in and quelled the tension as members of the public confronted the county officials. “Please don’t cause trouble here. We have seen what has happened and we are not happy. We urge you to lodge a complaint at the police station,” a police officer advised the journalists.
