Equity Bank plans to grow its non-funded income streams to create 50 percent of revenue over the next year to diversify its revenues as the operating environment becomes more tougher. The bank yesterday reported a 7.34 percent dip in net profits for the first half of 2017 to Sh9.34 billion from Sh10.08 billion last year following the introduction of laws that caps the rate at which lenders price their loans. As a result, net interest income declined by 15.5 percent to Sh17.94 billion. Loans and advances to customers dropped marginally by 1.46 per cent to Sh265.09 billion in June 2016 while customer deposits rose 13.65 per cent to Sh362.79 billion. “Innovation has proved to be a great enabler in driving growth. We are already registering efficiency gains from digitisation,” Equity Group chief executive James Mwangi said. The bank’s online platform, mobile banking arm and agency banking helped increase the customer base to 11.7 million. “I believe payment and transaction processing will be the biggest source of income for the bank,” Mwangi said. As at June 30, non-funded income constituted 42 per cent of the group’s total income. This was a 20.37 percent rise to Sh13 billion from Sh10.8 billion recorded over the same period last year. During the six-month period, revenues from mobile banking went up 336.63 percent to Sh649.7million while fees and commissions on loans and advances rose 41.79 per cent to Sh2.85 billion.
