Celebrity pastors Reverend Kathy Kiuna and Bishop Allan Kiuna are a blessed couple. Kathy has all the rights to stand on top of the world and broadcast what the Lord has done for her. The founders of Jubilee Christian Church have become grandparents again for the second time in a year. Their second-born child and daughter Stephanie Kiuna and her mzungu lover have welcomed a baby girl. This comes barely a year after Kathy's eldest daughter gave birth to cute baby, Nia Kovac, who is causing tremors online. Although we're not sure if Stephanie and her lover held a private wedding before welcoming their baby or will do one soon, the flamboyant pastor took to social media to share the good news with her followers. "Yeeeeeeey. What a Mighty God we serve, angels bow before Him, heaven and earth adore Him. He has done it again. Blessed us with a second grandchild baby AMANDA. David was so blessed until he asked God "is this Your usual way of dealing with man." I can understand him now coz God has blessed us yafu yafu," Kathy Kiuna posted. The excited mother of three, who seems to be besotted with her newborn grandchild, added another post. "Check baby Amanda. If that's not my double chin and nose please tell me what you mean. What shall we say unto the Lord. Thank you Jesus," she wrote.
