A family in Ol Kalou is mourning the sudden deaths of three children who died Friday after drowning in a four-foot deep water pan. The children’s father, John Gichini said the children, two daughters aged 13 and 11 respectively and a boy,7, were playing around the pan when the disaster occurred. Nyandarua Central OCPD, Wilson Kosgei said the mother had left them playing and went to the garden. She later discovered the children had disappeared and after searching for them, they found their bodies inside the water. "She eventually got to the water pan, close to where they had been playing, where she noticed one body, she then raised an alarm and when neighbours came, they were shocked to retrieve the other two inside, already dead," the OCPD said. The incident occurred at Kieni village, Kaimbaga location. Gichini said he was with the children about an hour before the accident when he had gone home for lunch and “they were all okay”. “We talked and they told me the food was not ready since their mother was still in the garden. I took tea and returned to Ol Kalou town. About an hour later my younger son called me with the news that one child was no more. I rushed home only to find three children dead,” he said. OCPD Kosgei said the family does not suspect foul play in the children’s death. “The family believe the children were playing and their ball fell into the water.Probably one of them went after the ball, while the others followed in an attempt to rescue him”, he said “But we are not concluding this until we do a postmortem to ascertain the cause of their death”, he said The bodies are preserved at J.M.Memorial hospital mortuary.
