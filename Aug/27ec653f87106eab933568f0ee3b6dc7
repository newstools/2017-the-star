Five candidates are seeking the Kisumu county speaker’s seat. Incumbent Ann Adul, whose term was dogged by court battles and impeachement threats, faces stiff challenge as she prepares to defend her seat. Competence, regional balance and party loyalty are some of the factors that will determine the winner. Following the swearing in of Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o, the is seat is set to be advertised. Adul faces an uphill task against former TNA secretary general Onyango Oloo, former governor candidate Peter Omollo, former Kisumu Town Clerk Ben Nyakinya and lawyer Ken Amondi. Amondi lost to Adul by a narrow margin in the last term. Omollo dropped his bid for the top seat on the Amani National Congress ticket in support of Nyong’o. The contestants have to convince the newly elected MCAs on why they deserve the job. Out of the 49 MCAs, only three were reelected in the poll. The previous assembly was plagued by frequent wrangles since 2013, when the speaker and the former Majority leader Samuel Ongou’ fought over corruption allegations. It was hard for the assembly to enact laws beneficial to residents. Adul survived three impeachment attempts. The persistent wrangling undermined the positions of speaker, Majority leader, Minority leader and clerk. At one point, there was confusion after two people occupied the position of clerk of the assembly. Both Ben Opiyo and Philip Adundo claimed they were the bona fide office bearers. The assembly has been criticised for alleged misuse of taxpayers’ money to finance costly trips of dubious value for MCAs and county staff. ODM leader Raila Odinga had to intervene to stop the wrangles. Former deputy speaker Pamela Omino washospitalised when she was caught up in a fracas at the assembly.
