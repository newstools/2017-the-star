Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago is considering hiring losers from the opposition who supported him. He said on Tuesday he received support both from NASA and Jubilee and his administration will accommodate all communities in the cosmopolitan county. Mandago and Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi campaigned for Charles Okumu of ODM, who ran against Francis Muya of Jubilee, for Langas MCA. They also backed Andrew Sure who ran against JP’s Peter Chomba in Huruma ward. Okumu and Sure lost. Mandago said, “I have told them that even though Baba [NASA leader Raila Odinga] lost in the polls, they should not be worried because Baba Mdogo [Mandago] won and they will be part of my team.”
