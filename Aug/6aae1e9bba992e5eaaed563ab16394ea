French multinational corporation for energy management and automation solutions Schneider Electric has partnered with Salesian C to launch a new laboratory at Don Bosco Boys&rsquo; Town Technical Institute, Nairobi. The lab will be used to promote vocational energy training among young underprivileged youths in Kenya. It is part of an agreement between the two institutions to renovate three Don Bosco training centres in the country. &ldquo;This training will help them find employment and raise their standard of living, not only for themselves but also their families,&rdquo; Schneider Electric chief executive officer Jean-Pascal Tricoire said.&ldquo;We share the Salesian Don Bosco Foundation&rsquo;s vision of development built on education and work.&rdquo;The foundation provides vocational energy training to at least 200 young Kenyans at three centres including Karen in Nairobi, Makuyu and Embu. The agreement will see Schneider Electric provide financial and technical support to renovate the electricity labs and launch a solar energy training module. The company will train local trainers to help manage the new equipment.
