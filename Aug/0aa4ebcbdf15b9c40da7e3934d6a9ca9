Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka on Monday warned MCAs-elect to toe the party line or face the same axe their colleagues faced at the ballot. He spoke in Unoa Grounds, Wote town, during Governor Kivutha Kibwana’s inauguration. “MCAS who will not stick to party ideals will face the wrath of voters just like their outgoing colleagues,” Kalonzo said. Only one out of 30 MCAs in Makueni retained his seat. Twenty out of 30 MCAs-elect run on the Wiper ticket. Kibwana took the oath of office alongside his deputy Adeline Mwau. He pledged to serve residents diligently, saying he looked forward to working with a cooperative assembly. The ceremony was presided over by High Court Justice Rose Ougo. Kibwana said he will focus on fixing the water problem. “We are set to present to the assembly a water bill to address the challenges in the sustainability of water development, utilisation and governance,” he said. “A water resource masterplan for the county and a water policy will also be developed.” The Governor also pledged to improve agriculture, health and business in his second term. Senator Mutula Kilonzo Junior and woman MP Rose Museo also attended.
