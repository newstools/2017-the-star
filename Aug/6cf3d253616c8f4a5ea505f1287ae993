The Independent Policing Oversight Authority is investigating cases of police killings and brutality during protests that erupted on Friday after Uhuru Kenyatta was declared winner of the presidential election. “Those cases where officers fail to justify the killings or use of excessive force their files will be forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions to be charged,” IPOA chairman Macharia Njeru said. “Culpability will not only be on the individual officers but also their respective commanders in the operations. Our investigation is impartial mainly focused on facts and evidence.” On Saturday, the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights reported 24 deaths as a result of police brutality since August 8. But police played down the number, putting the deaths at six. In a rally in Kibera on Sunday, NASA alleged that over 100 people had been killed, while the Kenya Red Cross Society on Monday said they have attended to 108 victims with severe injuries. “We are conducting an investigation on all the cases of alleged deaths, serious injuries and other forms of police misconduct,” Njeru said. The oversight agency is collecting data from police, human rights bodies and human rights defenders. It is also receiving incident reports from its own monitors and complaints directly from victims. Njeru said they had written to KNCHR, the police, Independent Medico-Legal Unit, KRCS, other human rights lobbies and defenders to share information on the incidences they are aware of. Acting Interior CS Fred Matiang’i has come under fire for denying claims that police used live bullets against protesters. Nairobi police spokesperson Charles Owino said officers were only targeting criminals committing “acts of arson and thuggery”.
