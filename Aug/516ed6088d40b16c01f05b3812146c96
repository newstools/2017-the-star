Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen and governor Alex Tolgos have buried the hatchet and promised to unite to develop the county. The two had many differences during their first term in office, with Murkomen often criticising the governor’s development record. Murkomen supported outgoing Keiyo South MP Jackson Kiptanui during the Jubilee Party primaries, widening the rift between the two county leaders, but Tolgos survived the onslaught, retaining the ticket. He then secured his second term during the August 8 polls. “Governor Tolgos and I have been friends since school days. We used to play on this ground. Tolgos played hockey at one corner and I played football on another side,” Murkomen said during Tolgos’s swearing-in ceremony at St Patrick’s High School Iten grounds on Monday. Murkomen praised Tolgos, saying he ‘maintained conscience’ during his campaigns. “I want to pledge as your senator and my colleagues in Parliament that we will give you 101 per cent support to ensure our county develops,” he said. Tolgos said he will unite leaders to ensure peace. “I will serve all residents regardless of whether they voted for me or not,” he said.
