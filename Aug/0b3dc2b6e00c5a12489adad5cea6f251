Anti-riot police yesterday were on high alert in
Homa Bay town to quell possible demos after protests slightly erupted over the provisional presidential results. The results put President Uhuru Kenyatta ahead of NASA presidential candidate
Raila Odinga. The protestors demonstrated for 30 minutes,
lit bonfires on the
streets, barricaded the Homa Bay–Rongo road and disrupted business in the lakeside town. They said the election was rigged. “The IEBC is not being fair to Baba (Raila) since the results they are showing have been disputed by Raila,” shouted
one of the protesters. Police dispersed the protestors. Anti-riot police are
manning the county tallying centre at Tom Mboya University College.
