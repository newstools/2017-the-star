NASA now claims Jubilee is coercing its governor candidates who were ‘rigged out’ and had vowed to overturn the verdict through court process to concede. The opposition said Jubilee have threatened NASA losers with prosecution, unwarranted tax assessments and demands , and interference with their legitimate businesses if they do not drop their planned petitions. In a statement to newsrooms, NASA campaign Committtee chairman Musalia Mudavadi (picctured) said most affected were governors, who were defending their seats on NASA affiliate parties, but were ‘rigged out’ in the August 8 poll. He listed Garissa, Machakos, Nairobi, Narok, Kajiado, Wajir and Marsabit counties as some of the counties where Jubilee candidates won with similar percentages, and where NASA candidates had vowed to take the battle to the courts. “Jubilee is insecure and worried about its own survival, knowing well that it lacks the mandate of the people. The regime knows every court case will expose the fraud that it is and willing to go all lengths, including blackmail, to secure consent, endorsement and semblance of legitimacy,” said Mudavadi. He likened the alleged coercion to old dictatorship antics witnessed during KANU’s rule. “This is political action by what looks like soft power, but it is no different from the brutal and illegal invasion against civil society organisations and the destruction of NASA tallying centres,” added Mudavadi.
