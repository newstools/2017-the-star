Discussions on investment opportunities for African countries will take centre stage in the ongoing 33rd Eastern and Southern African Trade and Development Bank Annual General Meeting held in Seychelles. The conference, which kicked off yesterday, aims to find solutions to challenges in managing investments and achieving development impact from a practitioner point of view. “Representatives of pension funds, insurance companies and sovereign funds will discuss their investment mandates, investment opportunities in the region and how to identify those that will generate significant impact on economic development while providing good returns,” Minister of Trade, Finance and Economic Planning of Seychelles Peter Larose said in a statement. The Central Bank Roundtable on Trade Finance, to be attended by central bank governors from the region, will discuss banking trends and regional issues and how the latter can be addressed by the banking sector regulators.
