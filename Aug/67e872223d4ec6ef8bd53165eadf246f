National women’s team duo of Naomi Too and Gaudencia Makokha bowed out of the ongoing 2017 FIVB Beach Volleyball World Championships in Vienna, Austria after going down 2-0 (21-9,21-10) to Canadian duo of Pavan and Melissa Humana-Paredes in their final pool ‘C’ match yesterday. The duo finished the group stages without a win, having also lost their earlier matches with identical sets of 2-0 against champions Brazil and Netherlands. With the results, Brazil, Netherlands and Canada finished tied on five points although the Brazilians enjoy high set ratio. However, all the teams will advance to the round of 32. In an interview, Too said the event has been a learning curve, but noted they had a better match against Canada compared to their previous ties. “It was windy today (yesterday) and that contributed to a good display because we were training under the same conditions in Mombasa. But all in all, it has been a learning curve for us and we hope the skills we have picked will help us in future assignment,” said Too. She added: “But the event has proved that in Africa, we are still behind considering there are less volleyball circuits compared to other regions. However, we remain indebted to the federation for ensuring we are part of the event.” Closer home, Rwanda beach volleyball team under the stewardship of Kenyan export Paul Bitok, were also bundled out of the championship having lost all their three matches. The duo of Charlotte Nzayisenga and Denise Mutatsimpundu failed to play Brazil in their pool ‘I’ opening tie due to flight delay, but went ahead to lose to United States of America and Canada with a simila 2-0 set margin. On the flip side, the pair of Maria Antonelli and Carolina Salgado of Brazil were the first duo to book a slot in the round of 32 in (Pool I).
