Parents have been warned against leaving their children alone at home at night — and told not to lock them inside. Lari deputy county commissioner Aaron Koros said mothers tend to lock children in the house for their safety. He said some children are left warming themselves using a jiko, others with a candle or a tin lamp, which can cause fires. Speaking to the Star on the phone yesterday, Koros said children are curious and can easily start fires. Koros was reacting to the case of a woman who left her two children at home ion Tuesday night at Gathumuri village in Kijabe Ward. She left a candle burning and a fire started.  GraceWambui said she left her daughter Purity Waruguru, 2, and her five-month-old son Ramsy Kinyiri  asleep and went to collect her phone at a neighbour’s house.
