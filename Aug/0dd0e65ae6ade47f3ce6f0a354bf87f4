In short, they want to see a rapid and significant improvement in service delivery,&rdquo; Uhuru said.The President congratulated the politicians for their poll victories but urged them to deliver real change or they would lose public confidence.&ldquo;Most of you have been elected for the first time. Don&rsquo;t allow power to go to your head. I have seen many taking that route and they failed. Wananchi are our bosses and that&rsquo;s why we want to change Nairobi for the benefit of wananchi,&rdquo; he said.Uhuru said Jubilee leaders need to work as a team to transform Nairobi and deliver quality improved services required by the city&rsquo;s residents.&ldquo;If it is celebration, please be moderate, and thereafter, start offering services. Kenyans who elected you are watching, and after some time they will start questioning whether you are fulfilling what you promised,&rdquo; he said.The President said he is counting on them to be &ldquo;peace ambassadors&rdquo;.Nairobi Governor-elect Mike Mbuvi Sonko said now that Jubilee won most seats in Nairobi, leaders will work to implement Jubilee&rsquo;s transformative agenda and improve services.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t understand why NASA is saying the election was stolen.
