The first born in a family of seven told journalists in Nairobi that he will use the money to start a business and at the same time use part of the amount to educate his siblings.&ldquo;I used Sh50 to bet last weekend and I am happy I have won this cash. I was introduced to betting by my brother Katana Charo although I&rsquo;m not regular on betting,&rdquo; he said. He added: &ldquo;The least amount I have used to bet is Sh 1 and I got Sh 8. But my brother is an ardent betting fan and it is unfortunate that while I begun betting only last month, my fortune has come early.&rdquo;His brother Katana said he will continue to bet. &ldquo;My brother was tired and he retired to bed early but I kept checking the prediction and when I found out that he had won the jackpot, I woke him up. We tried to call them (Elitebet) but they were not answering. In the morning we received a call from them confirming that my brother was the winner,&rdquo; said Katana. He continued: &ldquo;I&rsquo;am not regretting why I didn&rsquo;t bet last weekend rather I&rsquo;m happy my brother is the jackpot winner.&rdquo;The company marketing and corporate manager Edwin Tarus said they have dedicated financial advisers who are always on call to advise winners to protect them from exploitation by unscrupulous individuals. Tarus noted that not only do they give advise to the winners on what to do with the cash but also do a follow up.
