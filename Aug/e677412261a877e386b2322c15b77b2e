Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has suspended all 437 finance officers in the county. Those affected are workers from the National Treasury headquarters and those seconded to other departments in the whole county. In the surprise move, Mutua who was flanked by his deputy, Francis Maliti, at the weekend ordered the officers not to access the county offices until they are recalled after a comprehensive audit “I have directed all financial officers go on leave from now until further notice. This will enable a through audit, suitability assessment of staff and financial systems to be done,” Mutua said. Mutua said auditors and human resources experts will be brought in next week to begin an audit of the department. He said the move was part of a radical surgery informed by the views of residents he interacted with during campaigns for the August 8 General Election. Earlier, during his swearing-in, he pledged an efficient, people-focused, and responsive administration in his second and final term. Mutua also extended an olive branch to his political opponents, urging them to set aside their differences and work for the good of the people. The Maendeleo Chap Chap Party leader defended his seat after garnering 244,061 votes against former Kathiani MP Wavinya Ndeti’s 204,662 votes. Speaking to journalists shortly after receiving his certificate at the weekend, the governor said he would transform Machakos into a first-world economy by implementing a raft of plans captured in his 2017-2022 manifesto. “My administration will waste no time. We are getting down to the business of serving people and providing an environment for new opportunities that will transform their livelihoods,” he said.
