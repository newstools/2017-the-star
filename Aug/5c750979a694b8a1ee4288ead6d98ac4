Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko is facing a litmus test in his early days in office after hawkers flocked the city centre.The street vendors have occupied pavements, streets and back streets selling their wares in the full glare of the county inspectorate officers.A spot check by the Star in the CBD reveals total disorder and mayhem in the city's capital. Key roads such as Moi Avenue, Tom Mboya Street, Aga Khan Walk and Ronald Ngala Street have been turned into open air markets.The hawkers sell vegetables and fruits, cosmetics, clothes, mobile phones accessories, shoes and toys.&ldquo;We have to work because we don't want to steal and we are begging Sonko to please understand us because life has to continue,&rdquo; Jane Wairimu, operating near the Kenya National Archives, said.Paul Mundia said, &ldquo;This is not my business. I'm working for my boss and he only pays me a commission. He has a licence for this place.&rdquo;Unlike in the past when they used to hit the streets in the evening hours, the hawkers are now coming to the streets in the morning and operate until late in the night.Some of them are still using their old tactics of coming to the streets with babies to win the sympathy of the city askaris.During his campaigns, Sonko promised to come up with friendly and humane ways of managing the street vendors.&ldquo;We will not harass the hawkers, we will not kill them. We will be opening up some streets on specific days for the hawkers to ensure they do not operate everywhere in the CBD,&rdquo; Sonko had said.The governor promised to build, renovate and expand the existing markets and build new ones to accommodate the hawkers.Sonko also pledged to hold regular meeting with the hawkers' representatives and the business community in the city, to come up with a roadmap of addressing their concerns.When Evans Kidero was governor, city residents complained of the disorder in the CBD brought about by the unruly hawkers, matatu touts and street families.Some senior corrupt county officials have been blamed for the proliferation of the hawkers in the CBD as they allow them to operate there for a bribe.
