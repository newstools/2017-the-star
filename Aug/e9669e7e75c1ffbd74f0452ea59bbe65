City Hall loses at least Sh18 million revenue monthly through lax enforcement and corrupt deals between parking attendants and motorists, the Star has learnt.At least 2,000 vehicle owners do not pay parking fees each day via eJijiPay &mdash; the established online system, denying the city about Sh600,000 a day.This despite the fact that the parking department and all enforcement officers get instant reports from the system with all the information on defaulters.The county introduced online payments in 2014 to seal revenue leaks in the manual systems.The online payment platform gives real- time information about the number of vehicles parked in the city, owners who have paid the fee, defaulters, streets where they are parked and their registration numbers.Sh200 per vehicle&ldquo;They [parking attendants and directors] have all this information. We even go ahead and print the list of defaulting vehicles and send to them, but they do not clamp them. The problem here is weak enforcement,&rdquo; JamboPay CEO Danson Muchemi said.An investigation by the Star revealed that both senior and junior parking attendants collude with motorists, especially PSV operators, in certain streets to defraud the county.The officers pocket about Sh200 per vehicle, so the motorists can avoid paying the Sh300 stipulated daily fee, normally paid via the online system.&ldquo;We did not want this thing [online payment system] from the first day it was introduced. We knew it was going to hurt us. But we still have to survive,&rdquo; a parking attendant told the Star.The county collects about Sh2 million from parking alone but Muchemi said the amount could double if strict enforcement measures are put in place.
