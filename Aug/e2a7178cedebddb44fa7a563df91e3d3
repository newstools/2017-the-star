Candidates running for various political seats in Laikipia county have lashed out at Devolution CS Mwangi Kiunjuri for engaging in county politics. They said the CS is moving around intimidating youths by issuing orders to administrators to arrest them. James Mathenge, the chairman of governor candidate Ndiritu Muriithi’s campaign team, said it is wrong for Kiunjuri to take advantage of hunger across the county to buy votes by distributing relief food to propel his preferred candidate, incumbent Joshua Irungu, to victory. Mathenge said last week, the CS held a meeting with security agencies and instructed them to harass, intimidate and arrest agents of certain candidates. He said it is a ploy to manipulate the polls in favour of the incumbent. “As candidates, we are very concerned that the activities and conduct of CS Kiunjuri are impacting negatively on the goodwill and support that His Excellency the President and Jubilee enjoy in Laikipia,” he said. The leaders were addressing a press conference at Hippo Point Hotel in Nyahururu town on Monday. They said the CS turned himself into Irungu’s campaign manager and was using his position in the national government to campaign for him, instead of being a national leader. Kanu senator candidate Maina Njenga told Kiunjuri to stop using relief food to campaign for an individual who was rejected by the people. He said Laikipia leaders have resolved to unite for the sake of the county’s development.
