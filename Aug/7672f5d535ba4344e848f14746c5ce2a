Heavy rains pounding parts of Naivasha and Gilgil have left a trail of destruction. The main Eburru-Gilgil road has been cut off paralysing public transport. Traders and farmers in the agricultural-rich area are counting huge losses following the downpour that lasted for over six hours. According to a local leader Lydia Nyota, the rains swept away a bridge connecting Eburru with Gilgil town. She said farm produce was rot. Nyota said shoddy work on the bridge caused the damage. She said those affected include bussinesspeople who had arrived in Eburru to buy farm produce. “We are rounded, we cannot move because of that section that has been cut off and we are asking for the intervention of county government to help us deal with the situation,” he said. Nyota said the heavy downpour also destroyed several access roads in the rural area with key services being brought to a halt. “The only way we can now access Gilgil is by taking the long route to Naivasha which is expensive and some of us cannot meet the costs,” she said. At the same time, Nyota who is the branch chair lady of Maendeleo ya Wanawake organization in the area said the rains also filled Thome dam which burst its banks. The dam, she said had for a long time been neglected without proper maintenance stating that residents will have to look for elsewhere to get water. “We are also calling on the new County Governor Lee Kinyanjui to help us rehabilitating the only dam in this area that has been the source of water for hundreds of residents”.
