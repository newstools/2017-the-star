Water CS Eugene Wamalwa has dismissed Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang’ula’s calls for his arrest in connection with violence at a burial in Kimilili on Saturday. On Sunday, Wetang’ula gave Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet 24 hours to arrest Wamalwa and Bungoma Governor Kenneth Lusaka for allegedly masterminding the violence. Two people injured and many cars destroyed during the burial of businessman Edward Barasa who was a Jubilee supporter. The NASA co-principal was addressing a Ford Kenya rally in Ndivisi ward, Webuye East constituency. Wetang’ula said there is enough evidence – photos and videos – doing the rounds on social media. He said the two incited their supporters to attack Ford Kenya governor candidate Wycliffe Wangamati and party members. Barasa was killed two weeks ago at his home. His family was forced to cut short the service and hurriedly bury him. In a press statement to newsrooms on Tuesday, Wamalwa said Ford-K should take responsibility for the chaos and for shamelessly ferrying hooligans to a grief-stricken home. “The party that he leads must conform to decency and decorum in this day and age. It should shed its perennial precambrian culture of the past century,” he said. Wamalwa said Barasa’s widow Zippy had linked the murder to politics, hence the violence to keep her from repeating it at the burial.
