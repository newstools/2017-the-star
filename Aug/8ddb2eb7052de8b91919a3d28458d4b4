Kura Yangu Sauti Yangu movement has blamed police for the deaths of 13 people in the aftermath of the August 8 General Election results. Apart from monitoring the electoral process, which the lobbyists gave the thumbs down, they documented police action after the electoral agency announced the presidential election results on August 11. "IEBC's opaque and unaccountable management of election results has already produced deadly consequences. In the aftermath of the announcement of the election results, violence in various parts of the country resulted in death. Kura Yangu Sauti Yangu attributes the 13 deaths to police violence," Peter Kiama, executive director Independent Medico Legal Unit, said. Furthermore, he said they had received reports of the violent police dispersal of peaceful protests in Kondele, Mathare, and Kibra (Olympic, Gatikwira and Bombululu). "Live bullets, brutal beatings and teargas have been the police weapons of choice," he said. He said there were three incidents of rape reported in Mathare after police broke into people's houses and forced men out. "The overall picture is one of grievous violations of the right to life, freedom of assembly and security of people and property," he said. Kiama said force should be used to subdue with the objective of making an arrest and not execution-style killings. The movement wants weapons, lethal and non-lethal, accounted for after every security operation. In their preliminary audit of the poll, the movement said the election failed the free, fair, verifiable and credible test, saying the results released by the IEBC have numerous inconsistencies. "The declaration of the presidential election results on August 11, exposed contradictions and massive anomalies in the numbers released on the IEBC website," Njonjo Mue, a human rights lawyer and transitional justice expert said. He is also the International Commission for Jurists chairman and senior adviser of Kenyans for Peace with Truth and Justice. "In short, numbers do not add up," Mue said. ICJ executive director Samwel Mohochi said they found out that 15,073,663 voter turnout was announced against the 15,518,971 that was streamed on television screens. He also said the IEBC portal shows the number of votes cast were 15,591,217, creating a gap of 517,555 votes. Mohochi said the total number of registered voters certified after the KPMG audit was 19,611,423, down from 19,646,673 after the clean-up. The total number of ballots in the ballot packing list were 19,613,846, but the IEBC chairman declared the total number of registered voters as 19,637,061 giving a difference of more than 25,638 of the total register. "Declaration of the presidential election results was 25,658 votes above the 19,611,423 in the register. There is a significant shift in the total number of registered voters. Registered voters number vary from certified figure in 45 counties," Mohochi said. Their finding also shows votes in 288 constituencies do not match details in Form 34A and are no grand totals for rejected votes in 25 constituencies. He said the number of rejected votes on the IEBC's portal are 403,489, against only 78,547 on 1,400 Form 34As they had analysed. "There are glaring differences between results announced in the presidential election at county level and totals from constituencies in those counties. For example in Kisumu valid votes are 378,903 against 439,423 from the constituencies, showing a deduction for 60,520 votes," Mohochi said. "Similarly, the valid votes in Kericho were announced as 294,215 against 303,470 votes on the portal repressing a loss of 9,255 votes." He said there were incidences where the voter turnout in some stations exceeded number of registered voters. The lobbyists said the difference were not only huge, but also points to a problem with the election outcome as announced. "At face value, they suggest a full audit of the result the IEBC has released and their reconciliation with authentic documents from polling stations. The amount of missing data a full week after the election calls into question whether the declaration of results could be made legitimately," their statement reads.
