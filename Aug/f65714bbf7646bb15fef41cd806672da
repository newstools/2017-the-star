Kisumu Governor Jack Ranguma yesterday was trailing behind ODM’s Anyang’ Nyong’o, according to IEBC provisional results. This is an indication the six-piece vote campaign by the ODM brigade could have worked against Ranguma. Nyong’o, the outgoing senator, was in the lead with 258,289 votes
(63.35 per cent), Ranguma was second with 145,313 (35.64 per cent),
while Jubilee’s Atieno Otieno was third with 1,959 votes (0.48 per
cent). ANC’s Peter Omollo was fourth with 1,533 votes (0.38 per cent) and
David Wayiera of Alternative Party of Kenya fifth with 624 votes (0.15
per cent). Kisumu county has 539,210 registered voters. At the time we went to press results from 961 out of 1,027 polling stations had been beamed by the IEBC. Party leader Raila Odinga during campaigns urged supporters to vote
for ODM candidates to give him more leverage if he should win. According to the results, Nyong’o garnered more votes than was expected. Kisumu has seven subcounties: Kisumu East, Kisumu Central, Kisumu West, Nyakach, Nyando, Muhoroni and Seme. Ranguma dropped Deputy Governor Ruth Odinga as his running mate and
picked Nyando subcounty Knut secretary Ephraim Kananga, who is from
Nyakach. Many thought this was a bad move as he lost the support of Odinga's loyalist. Ranguma and Odinga clashed over county appointments, policies,
nepotism and war on corruption. He also lost the support of non-native
residents in Kisumu Central, where they command the majority of votes. The group complained of being sidelined and vowed to be part of a new
county government. Nyong’o picked Mathews Owili from Nyakach as his
running mate to neutralise Ranguma’s popularity in the subcounty. In the Senate race, ODM's Fred Outa was in the lead with 342,243
votes ( 82.98 per cent), James Ogoda, an independent, was second with
54,195 votes ( 13.14 per cent) and Ford Kenya’s Millicent Abudho third
with 11,469 votes ( 2.78 per cent). Jubilee’s Winston Ayoki was in fourth place with 4,544 votes (1.1 per
cent). The provisional results were from 970 out of 1,027 polling
stations. Outa and Nyong’o are outgoing Nyando MP and Kisumu senator
respectively. Rosa Buyu of ODM was in the lead in the woman representative race won
with 365,200 votes ( 89.19 per cent), while Citizens' Convention Party
leader Grace Akumu was second with 38,247 votes ( 9.34 per cent). Jubilee’s Beatrice Anyango was third with 3,288 votes ( 0.8 per cent)
and Hulda Odhiambo, an independent, was in fourth place with 2,739
votes ( 0.67 per cent). This was according to provisional results
from 963 out of 1,027 polling stations. The rejected votes stood at
12,292 for governor, senate and woman rep positions.
