Luck fell on one Alex Musili, who won the Nuu MCA race on the Jubilee ticket. But the same cannot be said for outgoing Mwingi Central MP Joe Mutambu, from the same ward, who ran on the JP ticket, but lost to Wiper’s Gideon Mulyungi. Musili, who is new to politics, won with 2,845 votes against incumbent Kilonzi Maundu’s 1,587. Mutambu introduced Musili to Jubilee and campaigned for the party ever since he ditched Wiper last year. During one of his campaign tours, Mutambu told residents he was sure President Uhuru Kenyatta would be elected for a second term and that Jubilee would get the most seats in Ukambani. He jokingly said he was ready to lose for Uhuru to win, but chances are he would not find that funny now seeing his ‘prophesy’ has come to pass. Had he won, Mutambu had hoped to have Musili - and a number of other aspirants he wooed from Wiper - on his side in his bid to continue popularising Jubilee in Mwingi Central. Musili accompanied Mutambu on the campaign trail, but little did he know his ‘boss in Jubilee’, as the MP was referred to, would lose. Many voters said they did not support the six-piece vote pattern and instead picked leaders based on their capabilities. Musili thanked voters for choosing him, despite running on the Jubilee ticket. Ukambani has long been seen a Wiper zone, but many candidates lost. The results of the election will no doubt force Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka to go back to the drawing board as he harbours his ambition to be President. Kalonzo has been considered the political kingpin of Ukambani for years, enjoying an almost fanatical following.
