Taking a common vitamin supplement could significantly reduce the number of miscarriages and birth defects worldwide, scientists reveal.Vitamin B3, known as niacin, helps to correct a nutrient deficiency that can stop babies' organs developing correctly, a study found in what is described as a major breakthrough in pregnancy research.Study author Professor Sally Dunwoodie from the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute in New South Wales, Australia, said: 'Now, after 12 years of research, our team has also discovered that this deficiency can be cured and miscarriages and birth defects prevented by taking a common vitamin. 'This has the potential to significantly reduce the number of miscarriages and birth defects around the world, and I do not use those words lightly.' Niacin is found in marmite, meat and vegetables. 'After the dietary change, all offspring were born healthy' The researchers genetically sequenced families suffering from miscarriages and birth defects.They discovered certain genetic mutations affect the production of the molecule nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), which is made from vitamin B3.The researchers then gave vitamin B3 to mice embryos with similar NAD deficiencies as those seen in some humans.'Before vitamin B3 was introduced into the [mice] mother's diet, embryos were either lost through miscarriage or the offspring were born with a range of severe birth defects,' the Victor Chang Institute said in a statement.'After the dietary change, both the miscarriages and birth defects were completely prevented, with all the offspring born perfectly healthy.'The findings were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. 'Significantly reduce the number of miscarriages and birth defects' Professor Dunwoodie said: 'Now, after 12 years of research, our team has also discovered that this deficiency can be cured and miscarriages and birth defects prevented by taking a common vitamin.'The ramifications are likely to be huge. This has the potential to significantly reduce the number of miscarriages and birth defects around the world, and I do not use those words lightly.'Australian health minister Greg Hunt hailed the study as a 'historic medical breakthrough'.He said: 'Today's announcement provides new hope to the one in four pregnant women who suffer a miscarriage.'And with 7.9million babies around the world currently being born with birth defects every year, this breakthrough is incredible news.' The next step is to develop a test that measures NAD levels in women to identify who are most at risk of having a baby with a birth defect. Such women could then be given vitamin B3 supplements.The researchers added current supplements aimed at pregnant women may not contain sufficient levels of vitamin B3.
