Public  Service, Youth and Gender CS Sicily Kariuki has directed all 47 woman representatives to surrender their vehicles. They were given the cars as patrons of the National Government Affirmative Action Fund (NGAAF). In line with the NGAAF regulations, Sh500 million was set aside for the purchase of vehicles for the National Fund Secretariat and each county secretariat. Each county received two vehicles from the Sh10 million allocation per county for a total of 94 vehicles. Woman reps posses most of the vehicles since the were patrons of the fund under the now repealed Public Finance Management (Affirmative Action Social Development Fund) Regulations, 2015. Following a meeting with NGAAF county coordinators at the Kenya School of Government, Kariuki said they have requested acting CS Interior Fred Matiang’i to support county commissioners in securing NGAAF’s assets. She said all woman representatives were instructed to return the two vehicles allocated to them to county commissioners by August 5, but they are yet to do so. Many of the woman reps lost their seats during last week’s General Election and subsequently lost their roles as patrons of the fund at the county level. The CS now expects a detailed inventory of all vehicles, stating their condition and all other fund assets. Kariuki said all county coordinators must comply with the regulations in Management of County Fund Accounts and provide a detailed report on all capital projects undertaken indicating the status of implementation. “I expect to have an update on progress made so far in securing NGAAF’s assets. I also expect that each county coordinator will familiarise themselves with the guidelines,” she said.
