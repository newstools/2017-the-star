The rules of recusal are clear."Noting such attacks have climaxed and become bolder with time, the Chief Justice said they will not bow to Tuju's demands."We are alerted by the audacity of the party as it seeks to determine who hears the cases it files in court. The emerging culture of public lynching of judges must stop," he said."The chronology of attacks on judges is worrying. JSC remains steadfast in defending judges from unwarranted attacks."Maraga added they will not get involved in alarming threats, intimidation and blackmail."Our judicial system has avenues for recourse should they be dissatisfied by the rulings we make."
