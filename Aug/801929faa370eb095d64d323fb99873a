Ugandan classic car enthusiast Kakooza Wazzir has entered a very rare 1991 Mitsuoka Le-Seyde two door coupe for the CBA Africa Concours d&rsquo;Elegance set for September 24 at the Ngong Racecourse. The Mitsuoka Le-Seyde is one of the nine entries by the Ugandan team, which will contest the classiest event on the Kenya Motor Sport calendar. Other cars from Uganda include Laban Mawanda&rsquo;s stylish 1957 Mercedes Benz 190SL sports car and the 1974 Mercedes Benz saloon of Ronald Walusimbi who was the overall winner of the recent Uganda Vintage and Classic Auto Show, which is also a Concours event. Ronald will also be driving his 1967 Toyota Corolla along the judging line at the Nairobi Racecourse on September 24. He is no stranger to the Concours having won the up to 2,500cc touring car class with his Mercedes saloon last year.The Mitsuoka Le-Seyde is a limited production car and only 500 were made. All were sold within four days after they went on sale. This two door coupe was based on the Nissan Silvia and is equipped with a two litre engine. Wassir will be competing in the class for up to 2,000cc touring cars and will be up against the 1972 Alfa Romeo 2,000 GTV of Kamene Wanday and Micky Bassi&rsquo;s 1988 Alfa Romeo 75 saloon.Over 56 car entries have been received while the motorcycles are heading for the 30 mark. The regulations limit car entries to 70 and the maximum for the bikes is 40 to ensure the highest possible standards of judging. It is likely that there will be a full field before the final deadline early in September.
