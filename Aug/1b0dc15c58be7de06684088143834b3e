Raila Odinga will be respected, regarded as a statesman and his legacy will live forever if he ensures there is peace and not a bloodbath, Mombasa elders (pictured) have said. Mombasa County Council of Elders said Raila should concede defeat to prevent violent protests and deaths resulting from post-poll demonstrations. President Uhuru Kenyatta was announced winner of the presidential polls on Friday, leading to protests in some NASA strongholds in Nairobi and Kisumu. Earlier, Raila and NASA said they would reject results as they were being manipulated. Local observers have concurred, but international observers said the voting itself was credible. International organisations have called for investigation into the claim of hacking the IEBC system. MCCE chairman Mohamed Jahazi said God did not plan Raila to lead Kenya. “Even if you tell people to demonstrate or declare you winner, it won’t happen; you won’t get the seat,” he said.
