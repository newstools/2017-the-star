Results of the General Election herald a new dawn for the Luhya nation that answered calls for Mulembe consciousness, former Budalang’i MP Ababu Namwamba has said. “The Mulembe nation heeded our call and shifted to support President Uhuru Kenyatta for a second term. This means Western Kenyan can now have a stake in this government,” he told the Star on the phone yesterday. Ababu defected to the Labour Party from ODM and was defeated at the polls. “Our best route to the political high table is to take our rightful place in the government of the day as we strategise for the 2022 polls.” He said the support Uhuru received in Western confirmed the Jubilee administration has performed well.  National belonging The Mulembe call was meant to rally the Luhya to a new consciousness embracing national belonging. The idea is that the political might of the community matches its numerical strength. The movement was meant to re-engineer the Luhya community to leave the past behind and embrace the future, Namwamba said. He served as an ODM MP for Budalang’i for two terms. He ditched the party in July last year and relaunched the Labour Party of Kenya in September, becoming party leader. Namwamba contested the MP seat in the Tuesday polls on the LPK ticket but lost to ODM’s Raphael Wanjala. Yesterday, he said he was headed for holiday at an undisclosed location and will later announce his next move. Namwamba said that the fact that Luhyas voted for Uhuru shows changing political tide in the region, which mainly voted for the opposition in every election. He also advocated for more youthful leadership. Noting that every election must have hiccups, Namwamba said that the August 8 polls were largely free and fair.
