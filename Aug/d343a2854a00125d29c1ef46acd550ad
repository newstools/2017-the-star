United States International University-Africa (USIU ‘A’) defender Bill Olang is expected back in the squad ahead Kenya Hockey Union men’s Premier League second leg set for next month. Olang, a key member of the USIU ‘A’ squad, last featured for the students in April before picking a knee injury that forced him to stay out for the remaining 13 matches. USIU ‘A’ coach Tom Olal has welcomed Olang back, saying his return is a big boost to squad as he brings on board the much-needed experience ahead of the second leg. USIU ‘A’ are currently placed fifth on the standing with 22 points. Olal said: “We blew hot and cold at the start of the season before we gained momentum on the homestretch of the first leg. We want to pick from where we left with same punch as we seek to challenge for the title that has remained elusive.” He continued: “We are aware of the gap that is between us and the table toppers but anything can happen in the world of sport. We have retained the same squad heading into the second phase of the league.” The 2013 champions Kenya Police top the log with 40 points after unbeaten run. Just like USIU ‘A’ many top teams participating the league have not signed new players ahead of the second leg. The law enforcers and women’s champions Orange Telkom have not signed new names. “Our objective is to have a feeder team just like the previous years. We retained the squad which begun training last Monday ahead of the Africa Club Champions set for Egypt later in the year and the second leg,” said Telkom coach Jos Openda. Police coach Kenneth Kaunda observed: “We have a good squad that is ready and willing to reclaim the title and we didn’t see the need to sign other players.”
