Opposition chief Raila Odinga yesterday termed "a smoking gun" an audit ordered by the Supreme Court, saying nearly five million votes were affected."Our case has been proved that forgery, alternation of documents fakery and deception have been used in various ways, including one in which the server was used," NASA lawyer James Orengo told the court."These affected nearly five million votes," the Siaya senator said, referring to discrepancies in 90 constituency forms."The two reports you accepted are two smoking guns.I was adding two more [by NASA] but I will pull these. We rely on these [official' two," Orengo said.He claimed the IEBC had not fully cooperated as required by the Supreme Court.But the claims were all denied robustly by lawyers for the President and IEBC who asked the court to ignore the findings and uphold Kenyatta&rsquo;s election."You can't be asked to nullify the election on the basis of allegations, suspicions, my Lord, but there is no challenging the numbers, the votes," lawyer Paul Muite said.According to Orengo, over 90 forms out of the 290 constituencies had fundamental mistakes, a clear indication that the August 8 vote was not free and fair, he said.&ldquo;Forms that were irregular, either on account of not being signed, not bearing security features and many other reasons explained in the report, affected nearly 5 million votes,&rdquo; Orengo told the bench.NASA lawyers protested IEBC denied them critical access to IEBC servers and only allowed partial access in some instances.Orengo told the Judges that from the observation of their IT experts, there was unauthorised access to the IEBC servers and that IEBC Chairman Wafula Chebukati's details was used for deletion in the database.Muite denied any noncooperation.Raila has previously claimed that the system was hacked.The former Prime Minister initially claimed results captured in IEBC data showed he was leading by 8.04 million votes against Uhuru's 7.7 million."These results are fake, it is a sham. They cannot be credible," Raila protested before the results were declared&ldquo;What the IEBC has posted is a complete fraud&hellip;to give Uhuru Kenyatta votes that were not cast&hellip;We have uncovered the fraud. Uhuru must go home and IEBC must be fully accountable.&rdquo;Earlier in the day President Kenyatta urged the Supreme Court to throw out Raila Odinga's petition against his win, calling it &ldquo;science fiction that Hollywood directors will love&rdquo;.Through lawyer Ahmednasir Abdullahi, Kenyatta said the petition was devoid of significant evidence to overturn his reelection.In a three-hour blow-by-blow counter to Opposition chief's case, Uhuru's lawyers described the challenge as hollow, to be dismissed even without a rebuttal from respondents.&ldquo;My Lords, this petition is like a science fiction that can only excite movie directors at Hollywood,&rdquo; Abdullahi told the seven-judge bench.Raila said the election was riddled by irregularities, including hacking, forgeries, switched names, transmission problems, ungazetted returning officers, misuse of state resources in an audacious scheme to steal the election. Uhuru's team likened that to interference by aliens.On Friday the court will rule whether Raila's issues are so numerous and grievous as to cast doubt on the presidential election &mdash; and order a rerun.Uhuru's lawyers said discrepancies cited by the opposition were not significant enough to neutralise the President's 1.4 million vote lead.&ldquo;Errors of addition may occur. The addition was done by our brothers and sisters manually. It is an electoral contest and not surgery in a theater,&rdquo; lawyer Fred Ngatia said, dismissing discrepancies as minor human error.He said all discrepancies amounted to only 800 votes.The Jubilee team dismissed allegations of a mathematical formula to inflate Uhuru's vote and emphasised international observers gave a clean bill of health to the August 8 vote.Raila argued his votes were systematically reduced, while Uhuru's were consistently inflated to rig the polls.On Monday, NASA lawyer Otiende Amolo said Raila was allocated zero votes throughout Nyando constituency, his Nyanza turf, yet he secured 60,135.But Ngatia told the court the polls conducted by the IEBC complied with the Constitution and the evidence clearly demonstrated Uhuru won honestly.Ngatia played CNN footage showing former US Secretary of State John Kerry giving an early thumbs up for fair and credible polls. He has not commented on NASA's detailed objectionsKerry, strongly criticised by NASA, headed the Carter Center Observer mission.Ngatia said all presidential candidates had agents in most polling station and they all signed results declaration forms.He also said the fact results started streaming in from 5.07pm, almost immediately after polling stations closed, should not be a complaint but a compliment.&ldquo;The first result was of 10 votes. Raila had six votes and Uhuru had four votes. How long does it take to count 10 ballot papers?" Ngatia asked. Raila had said that streaming results so soon after polling stations closed was suspect.He dismissed as baseless claims that other stations, which streamed results later, had 700 voters.On the mathematical formula NASA says Jubilee used to give Uhuru votes, the lawyer said the argument lacked merit as there was no absolute mathematical pre-determined mode used in the electoral contest.&ldquo;The process was carried out peacefully, integrity has been demonstrated and in this electoral contest what one is looking for is not a utilitarian approach. I pray this court to hold that the elections were credible&rdquo; the lawyer said.Abdullahi asked the court not to depart from its earlier decision in Raila's 2013 election petition. At that time it declared that the few irregularities did not affect the presidential outcome.The only way the court can invalidate the election is by establishing with cogent evidence that 17 million voters did something wrong, the lawyer said."My Lords, you can only invalidate the election on transgression of the voter who has exercised his will," Abdullahi said.He said the only other reason for invalidation is if the IEBC errs massively in conducting polls.In effect, Abdullahi said, for the election to be invalidated, millions of Kenyans must be convinced by the courts that exercise of their sovereign right to vote for persons of their choice was so wrong and does not matter at all."It's not about the winning or about Uhuru being declared head of state. The winning of Uhuru is the choice resulting from the sovereign will of the people. Uhuru is a nominal factor and the case is about the will of the people. It's about the 15 million votes and for you to overturn their decision you have to convince them that they made an error for you to rectify," the lawyer said.He cited an example of an illiterate voter in Mandera."My Lords, a guy from Mandera who doesn&rsquo;t speak English and casts his votes, he understands he is making his choice and goes to take care of his cattle. So can that choice be invalidated because an officer did not stamp some form? Can we invalidate the rights of an illiterate Kenyan because of that?" he asked.Abdullahi insisted the court should resist making this dispute abut the political supremacy of an individual.He also said another reason to invalidate an election is if foreigners who are not supposed to vote did cast ballots.Abdullahi, who participated in the 2013 election petition, dismissed Raila's approach that if court finds any irregularities, it should invalidate the whole presidential election.He called that argument so weak that it must be supported with a "belt and suspenders". The lawyer urged the court to be cautious in departing from its earlier decision in a presidential challenge, saying doing so will tarnish the reputation of the apex court and diminish its credibility."I have not seen a critique of IEBC in law review but by people who write pamphlets. Some critique on past [2013] ruling is the court relied on authorities from Nigeria. So what? Nigeria is super power...You cannot ignore Nigeria in terms of political and economic setting," he said.On claims the Jubilee Party improperly used Cabinet Secretaries to campaign and intimidate voters, Uhuru's lawyer said the claims were baseless. He said they cannot be considered by the court, especially because they were not pleaded in the main petition.On Monday the NASA team accused CSs Mwangi Kiunjuri, Joseph Mucheru and Eugene Wamalwa of using their offices to campaign for Jubilee. &ldquo;Having demonstrated the elections were held within the expectation stipulated in the Constitution, it would be unfair to invalidate them over infractions we have demonstrated don&rsquo;t exit," Abdullahi said.On rejected votes, the lawyers said they cannot be considered by the court in the final tally since the issue was determined in 2013.
