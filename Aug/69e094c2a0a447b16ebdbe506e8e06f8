The Migori county Nema branch will start effecting the national plastic bags ban with major supermarkets. Parnwell Simitu, Nema county director, yesterday said they have already liaised with county commissioner Joseph Rotich to provide security when officers effect the ban. “We already sensistised the supermarkets, which are the biggest users of plastic bags, and the 42 signed an agreement to have alternative packages by Monday, which will be effected,” Simitu said. The supermarkets are in Migori, Rongo, Sori, Awendo, Kehancha and Isebania. He said the county does not have any plastic factory, but its proximity to Tanzania will create a black market of illegal imports. “We believe by acting on big users of plastic bags like supermarkets and control contraband from Tanzania then smaller users like mama mboga and retail shops will change tact,” Simitu said.
