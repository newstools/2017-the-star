Meru Bongo king Nazizu Murume has come out to clear the air after his actions made many believe he has joined a cult. It doesn&rsquo;t help that his latest release is titled Illuminati.According to his official manager, Kelvin Keyfar Mundia cleared the air. &ldquo;Video yake Illuminati, ni ya kukashifu vitendo vya kujiunga na Illumanati. Wengi waliandika kwenye mitandao kwamba Nazizu amejiunga na Illuminati, yeye hakujibu yeyote, lakini alikuwa akiiweka tu cover photo ya huo wimbo kwa mitandao yake. Ni wimbo,&rdquo; he told Word Is.During the official release of the single and its accompanying music video in Meru, Nazizu dismissed the allegations that he has joined a cult. He described himself as a man who hails from a humble background, which even cost him the love of his life to a wealthy man.In the music video, Nazizu plays the role of a young man who is convinced to join a cult by a beautiful woman to enable him to get all the wealth and fame that money can buy, but he refuses. This leads to an argument because the price for all that fame and money is a blood sacrifice, which Nazizu is not ready to offer.The singer then insists that wealth and favour can be gotten from the good Lord and not via blood sacrifices. Besides Illuminati, his other jams include Sindi, Mawazo and Siwezi.
