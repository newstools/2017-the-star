There is no possibility of the electronic system for voting being tampered with following the murder of ICT director Chris Msando, the IEBC has said.CEO Ezra Chiloba yesterday said the system is secure and was designed to be operated by multiple users before gaining access.He said the system passwords were yet to be forwarded to the relevant officers who would handle them during the election. &ldquo;There has been no issue raised with the security company that has access to the servers. They are yet to give access to some people who will handle the system,&rdquo; Chiloba said.According to sources from the commission, the system was being tested by three security companies with one of them being identified as IBM.The commission has called upon security agencies to speed up investigation into Msando&rsquo;s death.&ldquo;Justice for Msando means Kenyans can only honour him by participating in the August 8 polls in large numbers to express their democratic right that he worked tirelessly to try and secure,&rdquo; IEBC chairperson Wafula Chebukati said.Soon after Msando&rsquo;s murder, it emerged he had recorded a statement at Central police station alleging his life was in danger weeks earlier.The complaint was transferred to the DCI. Police spokesman Charles Owino said Msando did not make a followup and failed to submit the phone number to establish the origin.&ldquo;The CID officer had made a followup when Msando failed to submit the contact they had asked for, but he reported that the threats were neutralised,&rdquo; he said. Owino said Msando&rsquo;s body was found on Saturday at 11.20am in Kikuyu before the family had given information on his going missing. Msando was reported missing on Sunday at 8.30am by his wife Eve Auma. &ldquo;The police had taken the fingerprints from the body since it was still fresh when it was identified and since it was a weekend they were to be matched on Monday,&rdquo; Owino said.
