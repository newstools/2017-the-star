Nyandarua governor-elect Francis Kimemia (pictured) and deputy Cecilia Mbuthia will be sworn in on Monday at the Ol Kalou stadium. Residents expect him to immediately start on working on the promises he made during campaigns. On Friday, Kimemia said, “This is our people’s victory over mediocre leadership, corruption, outright lies, abusive and divisive propaganda that was the hallmark of our competitors.” He said the politics of hatred and divisiveness have contributed to Nyandarua’s slow growth. Kimemia said Nyandarua’s poverty index is 46.3 per cent, above the national average of 45.2 per cent. On Monday, Kimemia spent the day at his temporary office in Ol Kalou, where he was briefed by executive committee members, chief officers and directors.”We believe he means business,” a director told the Star yesterday.
