The battle for Tana River governor turned out to be a  three-horse race when vote counting and tallying kicked off on Tuesday. During campaigns, it appeared the battle was between incumbent Hussein Dado of Jubilee and former Galole MP Dhadho Godana of ODM. But in the ongoing tallying,   competing to win in the on-going voter tallying exercise former speaker Dr Nuh Abdi of Wiper seems to be giving the two a run for their money. Godana of ODM was leading with 16,332 votes in the 199 out of 307 polling stations. He was followed closely by Dado with 15, 802 votes against Abdi’s 14,043. By press time, the race was neck and neck. Others in the race are former Garsen MP Danson Mungatana of KPP with 7,722 votes and former Finance executive  Ismael Algi, with 297.
