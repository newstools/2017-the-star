Diamond Platnumz’s father, Abdul, has spoken out for the first time after rumour had it that his son had impregnated another woman. Hamisa Mobetto, the video vixen to Diamond’s song Salome, gave birth last week to a baby boy, one that many believe is Diamond’s child. The child has been named after Diamond, whose real name is Naseeb Abdul, and child’s name is Abdul Naseeb. Diamond’s father told Clouds TV that he is extremely happy to have another grandchild and went on to thank Diamond for naming his son after him. “Heshima alionipa mwanagu Diamond Platnumz akaona kwamba ampe yule mtoto jina langu…nashukuru.” Abdul was asked why his son refused to admit that Hamisa’s child is his. “Hii sio siri, ila tu aliamua katika nafsi. Unajua vitu vingine ambavyo ni vya undani ukitaka kufanya haina haja ya kuambia watu kwa sababu hawakusaidii chochote. Yeye Kaamua tu anajua mwenyewe kinachoendelea, akaamua akae kimya tu.” Diamond’s father said he has never seen any of his grandchildren. He said he should marry both Hamisa and Zari since his religion allows him to. "Mimi nina imani kwamba Naseeb hajafanya kosa, yeye ni mwanamme.Nina imani kama kitakuwa kimetokea kitu cha kufanya, atakua akakaa tu na Zari akamuelewesha.Dini yake inamuruhusu kufanya vitu kama hivyo.Itakuwa hamna matatizo, kikubwa awape vipato wote.Nadhani hamna kikubwa zaidi ya malezi.Kila mtu anaelewa kwamba ana uwezo sababu ni Muislamu." He added: "Hivyo ndio kinatakiwa kiwe kwa sababu yeye ana uwezo wa kuona hata wake wanne.Dini inaruhusu, ana uwezo wa kufanya hicho. Ilimtokea kwa sababu unajua mtu akishakuwa superstar wanakua wengi inabidi ufanye bila kutegemea.Mimi silaumi sana mwanangu, ni mtoto wa kiume, sisemi kakosea, hajakosea." In conclusion, he said: "There is nothing to talk about, it has already happened. What he should do is marry them not just having sex without tying the knot."
