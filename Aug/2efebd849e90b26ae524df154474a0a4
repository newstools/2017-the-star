A prison warden accidentally shot himself and died instantly at a polling station in Malava constituency on Wednesday. The officer, attached to Shikusa prison in Kakamega, died at around 5am. He was with others at the polling station. Western regional police commander Moses Ombati said the officer could have accidentally pulled the trigger due to fatigue. "The officer had placed his head on the nozzle of the gun and accidentally touched the trigger.""It is unfortunate that we lost the officer in the course of duty," he told the Star. The bullet went through the chin and exited through the head blowing off the skull. The incident raises questions as to why the officer had his gun cocked when there was no danger. His body was taken to the Kakamega county general hospital mortuary. Ombati declined to give the officer's name and rank.
