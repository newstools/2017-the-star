Nine people were injured after supporters of Jubilee MP candidate Kevin Okwara clashed with those of independent candidate Janet Rotich's in Turbo on Friday. Among them is a woman who was kicked in the stomach and is currently admitted at a hospital in Eldoret. The two groups met while campaigning in Ngenyilel and Chepsaita, leading to harsh exchanges and stone throwing. "We met on a narrow section of the road. As the vehicles were being driven close to each other, supporters of Rotich started abusing my campaign chairman, leading to the confrontation," Okwara claimed. Police were called in to escort Okwara's convoy to Eldoret to prevent fighting between the two camps. His campaign manager Philip Chumo was treated for injuries at Racecourse Hospital in Eldoret. Rotich blamed Okwara's camp for causing chaos by provoking her supporters who were campaigning peacefully. "We were near Wareng and as our convoys were crossing each other, Okwara's youths started throwing stones at my team," she said. She said her campaign manager, identified as Moses, was injured and some documents were snatched from him. Rotich called for calm, saying she is not interested in violence. She said residents of Turbo will make their decision in the general election on Tuesday. She said her team recorded statements with police on the matter. Uasin Gishu county commissioner Abdi Hassan said police will take action against those responsible for the incident. "We have deployed adequate security teams in all areas and anyone engaging in such acts of lawlessness will be dealt with," he said. Rotich lost to Okwara in the Jubilee party primaries earlier this year. President Uhuru Kenyatta asked residents to vote for Okwara during a campaign rally at Eldoret's 64 stadium this week.
