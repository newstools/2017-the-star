A storm is brewing in NASA over ODM's plot to elbow out affiliate parties and seize control of powerful positions in Parliament available to the Opposition.NASA, weakened by Jubilee dominance in the bicameral House, is facing a dilemma. It ought to perform a complex balancing act to harmonise sharing of leadership positions amongst constituent parties.However, this appears to be a done deal, with little recourse by affiliates who will get leftovers.This portents a standoff among affiliates and strife within the Opposition that had trumpeted its unity. It is already fraying.And it must do this before the 12th Parliament reopens on Thursday next week.At the inaugural sitting, speakers and deputies of both houses will be elected and 415 lawmakers, including nominated MPs, will be sworn in.Raila Odinga's Orange Democratic Movement reportedly has allocated to itself key positions available for the minority &mdash; leaving Wiper, Ford Kenya, ANC and CCM to share the rest.In the National Assembly, ODM wants minority leader, minority whip an, PAC chairman.In the Senate, it wants deputy minority leader.It wants In the National Assembly, Jubilee won 140 seats and with its affiliates has 169.ODM has 61 seats, and with its affiliates 120 &mdash; Wiper 19, ANC 14, Ford Kenya 10, CCM 2A section of ODM members-elect of the National Assembly met secretly on Wednesday and identified key minority positions that they allocated to vocal and articulate loyalists.The meeting, said to have been chaired by ODM chairman John Mbadi, concluded the party, the second largest after Jubilee &mdash; will get the Leader of Minority in the National Assembly currently held by Wiper's Francis Nyenze.ODM further earmarked for themselves National Assembly Minority Whip and chairperson of the influential Public Accounts watchdog committee.In the ODM line-up, Mbadi is being considered for minority leader, while vocal Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi would take the PAC helm from former Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo.ODM wants to retain Homa Bay Women Representative Gladys Wanga as a commissioner of the Parliamentary Service Commission, where she served for four and half years.Outspoken Suba South MP Millie Odhiambo is being fronted to chair the Pan African Parliament, a lobby group of African parliamentarians.The leaked ODM line-up is likely to cause resentment within the party itself as the list appears to alienate some regions &mdash; as the majority of picks come from Homa Bay county.But contacted yesterday, ODM chairman Mbadi dismissed the leaked line-up, saying NASA is yet to decide on House leadership.&ldquo;ODM has not sat to agree on positions to go for. We were to have a PG yesterday (Wednesday) but it was canceled,&rdquo; Mbadi told the Star, saying NASA has a PG today.He said the opposition's focus remains battling the reelection of President Uhuru Kenyatta at the Supreme Court and will not be distracted by dishing out positions.&ldquo;Our priority now is the Supreme Court.These things of party leadership are within our control,&rdquo; he said.Yesterday, Kitui West MP Nyenze, said he will seek to retain his position of assembly minority leaders.Nyenze questioned the rationale of the supposed sharing of positions by ODM, but said the opposition would approach the House with a united front to successfully take on the Jubilee tyranny of numbers.Nyenze said sharing leadership positions in NASA should reflect the sacrifices made by the party leader Kalonzo Musyoka who relinquished the fight to be flagbearer.&ldquo;Wiper has made huge sacrifices and deserves to be appreciated, and not necessarily rewarded. I will personally be bidding for my position,&rdquo; Nyenze told the Star yesterday.&ldquo;I am firmly in the race."Nyenze is unlikely to be backed by other affiliates, as he was seen as a stumbling block to NASA unity. He had insisted that if Kalonzo was not the Opposition flagbearer, then "NASA is dead."A Senior Wiper official said its parliamentary group meeting would be held on Monday "to agree on our stake within NASA". He asked not to be named.Details of ODM's secret meeting indicate Ford Kenya was to retain Senate minority leader through Bungoma Senator-elect Moses Wetang'ula.ANC would chair the influential Public Investment Committee in the National Assembly.Former Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto whose CCM party won two seats would land influential committees.Under the Standing Orders, the opposition is allowed to only chair PIC and PAC &mdash; the two powerful public watchdog panels that oversight the Executive.But in a surprise move that could precipitated an imminent NASA stalemate, Musalia Mudavadi's ANC also laid claim to the PAC chair, minority leader, Senate whip and PSC commissioner.ANC calls the four slots "our irreducible minimum", signaling a clash with sister parties ahead of the joint PG next week.In the ANC line-up obtained exclusively by the Star yesterday, Lugari MP Ayub Savula is to succeed Nyenze as minority leader.ANC has also fronted Nambale MP and former PAC member Sakwa Bunyasi to head that oversight panel,while Vihiga Senator-elect George Khaniri would represent NASA on the Parliamentary Service Commission.Apparently in the ODM line-up, Bunyasi was proposed to chair PIC.Mudavadi's party is also adamant that the Senate minority whip &mdash; previously Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama &mdash; should be taken by one of its senators. They proposed Kakamega Senator-elect Cleophas Malala for the position.There's consensus across that board that Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang'ula retains his position as Senate minority leader.Ford Kenya secretary General Eseli Simiyu declined to comment, saying the party was focussed on the presidential petition before the Supreme Court.Alego Usonga MP-elect Sam Atandi said ODM, as the largest NASA party, should go for nothing less than minority leader, minority whip and PAC chair in the National Assembly.He said Mbadi as the seniormost Orange Party MP and party chairman deserves to be minority leader.PAC has previously been plagued by allegations of underhand deal-cutting, which resulted almost the whole committee sent packing and being reconstituted.The composition of influential parliamentary committees has always been roiled in controversies, behind-the-scenes lobbying and maneuvers as they are regarded political springboards and affect many interests.After the 2013 polls, the Opposition then under Cord, was forced to hold a retreat in Naivasha where they weathered internal wrangles and thrashed out chairmanship of PIC and PAC.Former Budalangi MP Ababu Namwamba&mdash; who in 2014 was forced to exit the committee under a cloud of suspicion &mdash; was elected the PAC chairperson, while Elders MP-elect Adan Keynan was voted to lead PIC. Keynan decamped to Jubilee and was reelected on August 8.
