We have already passed Jericho. We shall get to Jerusalem because no force will prevent the will of the people."Nothing will stop the will of the people to free themselves from corruption, deceit and the misrule that has characterised the Jubilee government," he said.Raila said the promise they made during campaigns is still alive."The journey to Canaan is on course. It's not an easy journey but it is very much on course.""KOOME DOES NOT UNDERSTAND LAW"On NASA's prayer vigil outside the court later today, Raila said Nairobi police commander Japheth Koome should read the law before rejecting their notification for prayers."We don't seek any permission...the law is very clear...that police officer does not understand the law. We are past permissions. He needs to read the law better."On Friday, Koome said he will not allow the Opposition coalition to hold a vigil at the Supreme Court ahead of petition hearings.But an official of NASA party ODM said no law gives police powers to approve or reject notices for public gatherings,Executive director Oduor Ong'wen said that it was "incomprehensible" for police to outlaw a prayer meeting.More on this: Police don't have power to reject NASA prayers request - Oduor Ong'wenThe court has postponed its ruling on poll petition applications from 2pm to 7pm.
