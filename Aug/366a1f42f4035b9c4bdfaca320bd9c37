Drinking green tea does help with weight loss and boost brain function, new research claims.The beverage has long been a favorite among dieters, and many tea brands tout its metabolism-boosting qualities.Now a study on mice appears to confirm that the drink can have a transformative effect in just a few months.Researchers in Yangling, China, found that when a key compound in green tea, known as EGCG, was given to mice, their body fat significantly reduced.Such mice also performed significantly better in cognition and memory tests, the research adds. HOW RESEARCH WAS CARRIED OUTThe researchers analysed three-month-old male mice.For 16 weeks, the mice were either fed a standard diet, a high fructose diet or a high fructose diet plus two grams of EGCG per litre of water.EGCG is the most abundant antioxidant in green tea. As well as measuring the mice's body fat, the researchers also had them complete a Morris water maze test.This involves placing the rodents in a pool and requiring they find a platform that allows them to escape the water. KEY FINDINGSResults reveal that the mice fed just a high fructose diet had significantly higher body fat than those who were also given EGCG or a standard diet. The mice given EGCG also took significantly less time finding the escape platform than those given just high fructose.Once the platform was removed, the mice given EGCG were also better able to find alternate routes out of the pool.The findings were published in The FASEB Journal.Study author Dr Xuebo Liu from Northwest A&amp;F University in Yangling, China, said: 'Green tea is the second most consumed beverage in the world after water and is grown in at least 30 countries. "The ancient habit of drinking green tea may be a more acceptable alternative to medicine when it comes to combating obesity and memory impairment."
