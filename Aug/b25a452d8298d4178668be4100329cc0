NASA co-principal Moses Wetang’ula has urged the electorate to come out in large numbers and vote for presidential candidate Raila Odinga. “We as NASA have walked around Kenya and Kenyans have united and decided they want change on August 8. So I am appealing to my Western people to vote for Raila so that he can streamline this country,” he said. Addressing residents at the Nalondo area, Kabuchai constituency, on Wednesday, the Ford Kenya leader called for the rejection of the Jubilee government. He said a NASA government will serve all Kenyans and its leaders will exercise power as trustees of the public good. Wetang’ula said they are not being driven by selfish gain. He asked Bungoma residents to vote for the Ford Kenya governor candidate Wycliffe Wangamati because he will develop the county.
