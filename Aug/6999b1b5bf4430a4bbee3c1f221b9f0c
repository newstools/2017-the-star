Intelligent people are more likely to swear and walk around naked at home, according to a new study. Quizzing about 1,000 people on 400 typical behaviours, researchers at the University of Rochester in the US also found that extroverts are prone to telling dirty jokes, while those with agreeable personalities are more likely to sing in the shower. During the study, participants were asked if they performed each of the 400 behaviours, and how often.  The results were then compared with their own personalities, with the aim being to identify signature behaviours for each of the main personality types. The findings, published in the journal Personality And Individual Differences, revealed each personality had its own unique behaviours. People with higher intellects were more likely to curse, eat spicy breakfasts and lounge around the house naked, while extroverts were more likely to drive cars faster that 75mph, gamble and go to the pub. Agreeable people had behaviours that benefited others and conscientious people were focused on avoiding irresponsible behaviours.
