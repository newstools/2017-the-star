Kanu made a major comeback in West Pokot, following the election of John Lonyangapuo as governor and the political return of Senator-elect Samuel Poghisio. The party also won several ward representative seats. Lonyangapuo and Poghisio withstood a strong Jubilee wave to win the polls last week. Outgoing Governor Simon Kachapin defected from Kanu to Jubilee in a move that appears to have cost him the seat. “I concede defeat and will support the new governor so that we can move the county forward,” Kachapin said last week. Lonyangapuo and Poghisio, backed by  party leader Gideon Moi, formed a strong campaign team. “Kanu is a party that unites people and we plan to work together with everyone so that we take our county to the next level of development,” Lonyangapuo said yesterday. He told the Star he would not sideline anyone, including those who worked in Kachapin’s regime. Poghisio served as Kacheliba MP for years and later as Information and Communication minister. He decided to join Kanu and come in from the cold. “I’m grateful for support of the people. I will work with the governor to ensure we make a difference people’s lives,”  the senator-elect said. Jubilee, however, won three of the four MP seats. Mark Lomunokon won the Kacheliba seat on the PDR ticket. JP’s Lilian Cheptoo won woman representative seat.
