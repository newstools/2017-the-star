NASA head of strategy David Ndii has said the coalition is well prepared for mass action if the Supreme Court fails to consider its evidence.Ndii on Tuesday defended the decision saying it comes from a need to seek a free democratic space."We have been calling for mass action since 1991 and we will not stop as long as some people try to restore dictatorship,&rdquo; he said during an interview with Larry Madowo on NTV."If change cannot come through the ballot, it will come through the bullet," he added.&ldquo;Protestors do not kill, they only resist oppression. It is the police who shoot and kill when protesters resist. Any killing is initiated by government. We will call for mass action,&rdquo; he said.Ndii said it is clear that President Uhuru Kenyatta is making calls for people to accept and move on while Raila Odinga is stating they cannot just move on a situation that has openly divided the country.He said identity politics are to blame as some politicians have made it a taboo to oppress other community.&ldquo;We need to discuss why Kenya should stay together just like in an abusive relationship people talk and agree either to break up or move on,&rdquo; he saidHe said NASA moving to Supreme Court is not necessarily to win the case but to show to the world what happened during the electoral process.More on this: [STATEMENT] NASA giving Supreme Court second chance, Raila says on election"We as NASA clearly know that the problem we are dealing with is the political impunity and we know courts cannot solve this. We are fighting the election not just to win power but on grounds of implementing electoral reforms," Ndii said.He said the courts do not have to rule in favour of NASA but can make a considered judgment showing NASA lost fairly in a procedural manner.He said the current situation being witnessed in the country is a clear indication that the current regime has captured both IEBC and the judiciary to put up a system against the will of people through sham elections."There should be open civil conversations on this matter and frightening people with secession will not help and throwing some statements does not amount to incitement," Ndii said.NASA has moved to the Supreme Court to challenge the results of the presidential election that saw Uhuru win with 8 million votes, whole Raila got 6 million.Raila Odinga said they took the decision they had said they wouldn't to give the court a second chance. He said it also followed wide consultation and the current oppression on civil societies."The court can use this chance to redeem itself, or, like in 2013, it can compound the problems we face as a country," he told a press conference at the Okoa Kenya Secretariat in Lavington, Nairobi, on Wednesday.Thirdway Alliance leader Ekuru Aukot has also sought to be enjoined in the petition, saying the election was unfair.IEBC on Tuesday filed some 50,000 documents in response to NASA's case.
