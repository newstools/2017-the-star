Kemri has partnered with the Kwale government to build a Sh15 billion research centre. Two hundred acres have been set aside in Gulanze, Kinango subcounty, for the project. Speaking during the handover on Tuesday, Governor Salim Mvurya commended Kemri for the upcoming project, adding it will help transform residents’ lives and improve the county’s socioeconomic status. He said infrastructure, including roads connecting to the centre, will be improved. “I can see a bright future with more possibilities,” Mvurya said. He said the county is committed to ensuring the project is a success. “I want to urge locals to shun people who want to politicise this important project,” Mvurya said. Kemri country director Yeri Kombe said the success of the project depends on whether county officials cooperate.
