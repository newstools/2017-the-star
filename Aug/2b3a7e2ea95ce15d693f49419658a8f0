Researchers have started trials for a new malaria drug, as fears over resistance to the current medicines rise.Novartis and anti-malaria lobby Medicines for Malaria Venture launched a patient trial for a next-generation antimalarial compound with the potential to treat drug-resistant strains.The trial will test the efficacy of the compound, codenamed KAF156, in combination with a new, improved formulation of antimalarial treatment.Malaria prevalence is declining in Kenya, dropping from 11 per cent to eight in the last five years.However, in the coastal areas near the Indian Ocean and areas around Lake Victoria, prevalence is between 8 per cent and 27 per cent.In Nairobi, fewer than one per cent of people harbour the parasite that causes malaria, the Health ministry says. &ldquo;Because transmission is not the same across the whole country, each region has its own intervention package,&rdquo; Dr Rebecca Kiptui told the World Health Organisation.She is the head of surveillance, monitoring, evaluation and operational research for Kenya&rsquo;s National Malaria Control Programme.Kiptui was not available yesterday to comment on the new drug trial.However, malaria experts say the next-generation drugs are urgently needed to tackle rising resistance to current drugs.Emergence of resistance to the current drugs has been reported in Asia and reduced sensitivity to artemisinin has also been sporadically reported in parts of Africa, but not in Kenya.Dr Andrew Githeko, chief researcher at the Kenya Medical Research Institute, said resistance to pesticides used to treat nets has been reported.&ldquo;First, mosquitoes have adopted survival tactics, changing their human biting behaviour and developing resistance to insecticides such as DDT and pyrethroid,&rdquo; he said.Novartis said the first trial centre for the new drug candidate is operational in Mali and will be followed by 16 centres across nine countries in Africa and Asia over the next few months.&ldquo;Developing new antimalarial medicines is critical to achieving malaria elimination. Innovative science continues to be our best weapon against the disease,&rdquo; said Vas Narasimhan, Global Head of Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer WHO.KAF156 belongs to a novel class of antimalarial compounds called imidazolopiperazines. It has the potential to clear malaria infection, including resistant strains, as well as block the transmission of the malaria parasite.The Phase IIb study will test multiple dosing combinations and schedules of KAF156 and lumefantrine, including the feasibility of a single dose therapy.As children are the most vulnerable, the goal is to include them in the clinical trial soon, after safety review of the data generated in adults.
