Campaigns for the governor seat in Nyeri took a new twist on Tuesday when a local businessman Thuo Mathenge, who was initially in the race, joined forces with incumbent Samuel Wamathai. The IEBC had given Mathenge the clearance certificate but it was later revoked after the electoral agency questioned his degree certificate. After court battles which went on for more than two months, he lost the case at the Court of Appeal in Nairobi on Monday. After the blow, Mathenge immediately threw his weight behind Wamathai, five days to the General Election. In a charged meeting attended by more than 500 of their supporters in the Kirichu area, Nyeri Town constituency, Mathenge said they have struck a deal with the governor if he wins. Wamathai welcomed Mathenge acknowledging they signed an MoU.
