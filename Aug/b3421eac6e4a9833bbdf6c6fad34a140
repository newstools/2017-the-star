The second assembly of the Nairobi county is expected to hold its first sitting on September 5.The assembly administration has set the day as the tentative date for the sitting, subject to gazettement by Governor Mike Sonko.&ldquo;We are in constant communication with the governor and immediately the IEBC gazettes the names of the nominated members, then we will advise him appropriately,&rdquo; clerk Jacob Ngwele said.According to the standing orders, the assembly should hold its first sitting within 14 days after the declaration of the results by the electoral commission.&ldquo;Declaration of the result in this case refers to the date the IEBC gazettes the names of both elected and nominated members,&rdquo; Ngwele said.The commission gazetted the elected members last Wednesday and is expected to gazette the names of the nominated MCAs tomorrow.The city assembly has 85 members who were elected on August 8.Out of the 85, only 24 were reelected.The losers will hand over to newly elected leaders today in their respective ward offices.All the 85 MCAs have offices in their respective wards, complete with staff.Jubilee Party won the majority of the seats &mdash; 45. NASA scooped 38 seats, with ODM getting 36 seats and Wiper two.Makina ward in Kibra was won by a PDU candidate, while Korogocho ward was won by an independent.The House rules state that there will only be two items in the order paper on the first sitting &mdash; the election of the speaker and the swearing in of members.The standing order requires that after the gazettement of the date of the first sitting by the governor, the clerk will declare the position of the speaker vacant and invite interested individuals to apply for the seat.&ldquo;Anything contrary to this, will be unlawful,&rdquo; Ngwele said.At least 15 people have expressed interest in the powerful position.They include incumbent Alex Magelo, outgoing Senate chief whip Beatrice Elachi, outgoing MPs Kabando wa Kabando (Mukurwe-ini) and Benson Mutura (Makadara).Others are outgoing county Deputy Speaker Ken Ngondi, the county chief of staff George Wainaina, outgoing Karura MCA Kamau Thuo and the county Public Service Board vice chairperson Vesca Kegongo.However, Elachi appears to be having an edge over the rest after the President endorsed her in a meeting with the MCAs-elect at State House last Saturday.
