Property worth Sh1 million was destroyed in an inferno at Kiaritha village, Kirinyaga county, on Monday. Security sources investigating the fire, which destroyed Joram Karubiuâ€™s home, said it was caused by an electrical fault. County chief fire officer John Kiama also said it was caused by an electrical fault. He urged residents to employ qualified electricians to wire their homes. The house was destroyed, despite efforts by the firefighters. At some point it seemed the fire would spread to the nearby Kiaritha slum, but it was contained. Neighbour Moses Mutugi said no one was at home when the fire broke out at 4pm. Mutugi and other neighbours tried to put out the fire but were overwhelmed and called in the firefighters. Kiama said they had difficulties getting to the home due to poor roads.
