Deputy President William Ruto (pictured) yesterday said he is proud that this year&rsquo;s election was more issue-based and less ethnic and peaceful compared to previous years. &ldquo;Political formations were less ethnic; we had the face of Kenya in both Jubilee and the National Super Alliance.&rdquo; &ldquo;More issues were canvassed than in any other election. I can say our country is maturing.&rdquo; He said in any election there are those who will win and those who will lose, but Kenyans have to move forward a united nation. Speaking at Faith Evangelistic Ministry, Karen, Nairobi, the DP said Kenyans voted for leaders of their choice. &ldquo;It does not matter how you voted. It does not matter who you voted for. Today, we are all winners,&rdquo; Ruto said. He said elected leaders, led by President-elect Uhuru Kenyatta, will serve Kenyans equally and fairly irrespective of their political affiliation. At the same time, the DP attributed Jubilee&rsquo;s victory to prayers, and urged Kenyans to continue praying for leaders to do the will of God.Ruto said it was miraculous that Jubilee won the election in 2013, won the cases at the Hague, attained remarkable achievements in four-and-a-half years, and still won the 2017 election. Ruto was accompanied by MPs-elect John Kiarie of Dagoreti South, Nixon Korir (Lang&rsquo;ata), Stanley Muttama of Lamu West, and Mercy Gakuya (Kasarani).
