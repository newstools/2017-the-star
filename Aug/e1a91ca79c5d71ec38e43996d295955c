Buuri MP-elect Rindikiri Murwethania (pictured) on Thursday visited shopping centres in the constituency, thanking voters for electing him. He addressed residents in Maili Tatu and said, “I will work for the people and help tame insecurity as our people have persistently been attacked by bandits. I will also upgrade poor roads.” Residents were impressed by Murwethania’s ‘humility’. One said, “We have elected many leaders, but none has ever come to tell us thank you, we appreciate his gratitude and humility.” Murwethania, who ran on the PNU ticket, trounced Mugambi Angaine during nominations. Incumbent Kinoti Gatobu opted to vie for Meru governor, but shelved his bid in support of Kiraitu Murungi, who won on the Jubilee ticket. Gatobu, 31, was the youngest MP in the 11th Parliament. The politician stepped down after President Uhuru Kenyatta promised him a state position during his tour of the county. “We have agreed that he steps down then we will find a job for him in government. He can then get more experience and when Kiraitu and I retire, he and [Deputy President William] Ruto can continue with the work,” the President said. Ruto wants to rule Kenya after Uhuru completes his second and final term in 2022. Governor race loser Peter Munya said the county election was rigged. He and Kiraitu were bitter rivals.
