NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga’s family yesterday dismissed government allegations that their daughter Rosemary operated illegal accounts. They said they have instructed their lawyers to move to the High Court to declare NGO Coordination Board executive director Fazul Mahamad unfit to hold public office. The family in a press statement said Key Empowerment Foundation had not started operations after the government refused to register it. “We challenge Fazul to share with Kenyans the actual account numbers he wants frozen,” stated the press statement. The Odingas said Rosemary submitted all the required documents for registration, but the foundation is yet to be issued with a certificate to operate and the government has not responded. “Without the certificate, there is no way it could open a bank account and receive the monies alleged,” the family said. Rosemary described the allegations levelled against her as “a defamatory attack”. “He [Fazul] claims that the group has “several illegal [sic] authorised bank accounts containing hundreds of millions of shillings,” she said. Fazul on Tuesday accused the founadation of accepting foreign funds to engage in “subterfuge political activities globally and nefarious regime change tactics”. The Odingas say their daughter does not appear among members in the application for registration submitted to the NGO Coordination Board. “Rosemary Odinga is a principled, selfless, public spirited and deeply admirable person who is not known for cutting deals and shylocking,” they said. They said Rosemary has been involved in charitable works for underprivileged children, particularly in Kibra, without involvement in any fraud.
