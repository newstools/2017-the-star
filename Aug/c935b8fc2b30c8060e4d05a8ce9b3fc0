Kisii Governor James Ongwae (pictured) pledged to sack corrupt and lazy county staffers during his swearing in on Monday. His office is finalising listing staff who are lazy, those who abscond duty and those who engage in graft, he said. Ongwae said he is keen on leaving a legacy and will ensure tough disciplinary action is taken against such officers. “I am appealing to the residents of Kisii county not to personalise the purging exercise when you find that some of those sent away are your relatives, friends or from your area, as the exercise will be objective and impersonal,” he added, amid cheers from the crowd at Gusii Stadium. Ongwae and Deputy Governor Joash Maangi were reelected. The governor’s office will reorganise to come up with an effective and efficient structure, Ongwae said. “During my interactions with residents over the campaign period, their message was very clear that all they are interested in is transparent and efficient service delivery,” he said. “I will not hesitate to take action on those who are underperforming or who do not uphold public service ethos. It is not going to be business as usual. If you can’t perform, there are many able people around who can replace you.” The governor spelt out his immediate activities, which include forming the cabinet and hiring chief officers. Ongwae will send home most ministers and chief officers, some of whom campaigned for his opponents in the General Election. The governor said all posts of chief officers will be advertised in line with Section 45 of the County Government Act.
