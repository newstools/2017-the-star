A 14-year-old girl was on Thursday killed by a crocodile on Ng’ou beach in Lake Victoria, Homa Bay county. Hellen Amondi had gone to fetch water when she was attacked. The class six pupil at Ndonyo Primary School in Siaya county was in the company of her mother Margaret Atieno and twin sister. Atieno said, “We were almost leaving the shore but she went back to clean mud on her feet when the crocodile grabbed her,” Atieno said. The mother of six watched as the reptile carried her daughter away. “I raised the alarm, but all eforts to save her were in vain,” she added. KWS South Nyanza regional warden Mary Mayande led the recovery effort. Assistant chief William Omogi said crocodile attacks had escalated.
