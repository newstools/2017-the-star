A Kenyan rapper has revealed some intimate details of her high school lesbian fantasies that got her expelled from school. Rapper Xtatic, who recently bagged a lucrative recording deal, said she was expelled from her high school for acting and dressing "boyish". "IÂ remember being expelled from my second high school for 'apparently conducting lesbian activities', which was actually a backup plan by the board because I used to act "boyish", they said, also because I could not confess to having any hand to some strike... By that you can definitely see that they really wanted me out of the school," Xtatic said in a Facebook post. The long-winding post then moves on to more steamy confessions about her roommate, who would "come to give me stories naked while she oiled herself, and I couldn't take my eyes off of her. Do I remember wtf she was talking about? NOPE ... And the fact that nothing happened, just made me snap out of that memory and I stormed out on the board angry as hell." Fans are wondering if this is Xtatic's way of outing herself.
