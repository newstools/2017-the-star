Only a few of plastics manufacturers and importers have pledged to comply with the ban imposed by the government.This comes a few weeks to the deadline.Environment CS Judi Wakhungu, through a gazette notice dated February 27, banned the use of plastics. This will be effective from next month.But out of 104 companies that the National Environment Management Authority had written to by July 1, only a few have responded.&ldquo;Less than 10 responded. Some have said they will comply without committing themselves,&rdquo; Nema communications director Evans Nyabuto said yesterday.Carrier bags constructed with handles and with or without gussets, or flat bags without handles and with or without gussets will no longer be allowed in the market.The use, manufacture and importation of all plastic bags used for commercial and household packaging will be illegal.Manufacturers have up to August 28 to declare their stock and a phase-out plan.They are also required to stop providing plastic single-use carrier bags to customers on the same date.Being found with plastics will attract a fine of between Sh2 million and Sh4 million, or a jail term of between one and two years, or both.Twenty-four million plastic bags are reported to be used in the country monthly &mdash; half of which end up as solid waste.Nakumatt Holdings chief marketing officer Andrew Dixon said customers have been supportive and are beginning to actively adopt reusable shopping bags.&ldquo;Our Think Green, Go Blue Reusable bags have proven to be quite popular,&rdquo; he said.Dixon said Nakumatt had limited plastic bags stocks, which depleted quickly.The firm has been encouraging customers to come with their own bags or buy more durable re-usable bags as it seeks long-term alternatives.Nakumatt Think Green Go Blue bag retails for Sh75 for the big bag and Sh50 for a small one.The Kenya Association of Manufacturers CEO, Phyllis Wakiaga, told the Star that they are waiting for clarifications on the plastic materials used by industries for packaging.She said people such as those dealing with flowers and cereals have raised concerns.&ldquo;We had commitment and we are engaging, as it is a nightmare for businesses,&rdquo; Wakiaga said on the phone, adding that many industries used the materials for packaging.A plastics manufacturer on Tuesday told the Star they are &ldquo;still in the dark&rdquo;.&ldquo;We do not have a clarification from the government about the ban. We have slowed [manufacturing] a bit and we are now manufacturing based on customer demands,&rdquo; its official said. He said workers fear losing their jobs.KAM said 176 plastics manufacturers, who directly employ 2.89 per cent of all Kenyan employees and indirectly employ more than 60,000 people, will be hurt by the ban.
