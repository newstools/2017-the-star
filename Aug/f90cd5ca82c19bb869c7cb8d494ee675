Five women and a male legislator who were in 2013 nominated in the bi-cameral Houses have made a debut in elective positions after clinching different positions in Tuesday’s General Election. The six are among nine nominated lawmakers who had sought elective posts. Those who vied include senators Martha Wangari, Johnson Sakaja and Oburu Oginga, who was trounced in the ODM primaries, Beatrice Elachi, Elizabeth Ongoro, Naisula Lesuuda, Janet Ongera and Zuleka Hassan. However, Elachi and Ongoro lost their bids for MP. Sakaja won the Nairobi Senate seat, flooring his opponent Edwin Sifuna of ODM with 806,764 votes against 670,997. Sakaja will replace governor-elect Mike Sonko, the outgoing senator. Wangari and Lesuuda have respectively clinched the Gilgil and Samburu West MP seats. Lesuuda, who ran on the Kanu ticket, beat her Jubilee rival Jonathan Lelelit with 14,561 votes against 13,971. Wangari, who flew the Jubilee flag, garnered 51,943 votes to beat Paul Gitahi of Maendeleo Chap Chap, who scooped 15,262. Ongera and Hassan respectively scooped the Kisii and Kwale woman representative seats on the ODM ticket. Ongera trounced Jubilee candidate Dorice Amburi with 168,400 votes against 142,296. Hassan beat her Jubilee rival Zainab Chidzuga after getting 82,479 votes against 50,294. Nominated senators had earlier on raised concern about the privileges their elective counterparts enjoyed. They had said unlike their elected counterparts, they did not have a say over bills moved in the Senate. “When a bill concerning the counties is brought before the Senate, the nominated senators cannot vote for it,” Wangari told the Star on Friday. Nominated senators are not given mileage allowance and Constituency Development Fund money, that is only allocated to elected Members of Parliament.
