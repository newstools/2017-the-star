The second issue of M-Akiba retail bond has only attracted 17 per cent uptake of the targeted Sh1 billion, 20 days to its sale closure, the Nairobi Securities Exchange has disclosed. The new record low is an equivalent of Sh174.45 million which has been raised from 265,902 subscriptions up from 235, 672 accounts recorded (a 12.9 percent growth) on the first closure which raised Sh140.8 million. The M-Akiba facility was launched to encourage more retail investors, who had been locked out for many years, to participate in bonds trading but this dream has not been achieved as yet. The low appetite for the mobile phone based bond has been blamed on inadequate awareness among Kenyans on what the offer actually entails, according to the NSE chief executive officer Geoffrey Odundo. “We are optimistic that we will be able to hit the Sh1 billion M-Akiba target before it closes. We are currently working together with our partners by undertaking an aggressive marketing campaign to reach all the Kenyan citizens,” said Odundo. The first issue, closed on June 30, 18 days after it was listed at the NSE in April this year. The second issue will be closed on September 11, where investors who had bought the bond before the closure of the first issue shall be paid interest earned from their investments followed by normal interest payments to be made after every six months. Speaking on the performance of NSE half year results, Odundo noted that they posted a 5.1 per cent net profit drop in their first half results from Sh81.96 million in 2016 to Sh77.77 million as at June, 30 2017. He attributed the drop to an increasing expense on product development, a late pick up of the market and the introduction of interest capping rates on banks.
