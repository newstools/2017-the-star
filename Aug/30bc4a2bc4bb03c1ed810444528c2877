Murang’a Governor Mwangi Wairia has told politicians to stop using the church to spread propaganda against their rivals. Churches are symbols of unity and should not be used to play politics and divide people, he said yesterday. A letter written by three bishops from the Catholic church, ACK and Winners’ Chapel as well as two moderators from the African Christian Church and Schools and PCEA has been doing the rounds. It urges locals not to vote for corrupt politicians. The letter, which has been read in some churches, states corruption has been a challenge in Kenya for a long time but it can end by not voting in corrupt leaders. “Corruption is our problem… We need to resist the temptation to participate in it by voting in corrupt leaders,” the letter reads. “We ask that you give greater attention to the damage caused in our society by rampant corruption and we encourage all to work towards its eradication by choosing leaders who are honest, transparent, humble, God-fearing, respectful and who will always do the will of God as servant leaders,” the letter continues. Wairia criticised the church for ‘getting involved in politics’. He said it is wrong for the clergy to try and sway faithful towards certain leaders. Wairia’s only rival Moses Mwangi is a former pastor. He is seen as the majority of church leaders’ preference. Mwangi has also circulated bulk text messages echoing the message of the letter. He has said leadership is a calling from God and urged locals not to vote for leaders who do not respect the church and its leaders. Wairia said, “At a time when the country is polarised, the clergy should stick to praying for peace and shepherding their flock living in harmony.” He told the church not to give a platform to politicians who discredit their rivals.
