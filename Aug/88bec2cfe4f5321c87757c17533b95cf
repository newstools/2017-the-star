Lamu will siphon water from the River Tana for domestic purposes in a bid to solve the perennial fresh water shortage facing many parts of the county. Speaking in Lamu on Monday, Governor Fahim Twaha said the water will be taken through a series of treatment procedures, after which it will be channeled to storage tanks and residences, ready for use. Twaha said there was need for a permanent solution to the water shortage problem to not only enable locals to live normal lives as the rest of Kenyans but to also keep waterborne illnesses at bay. “I understand fresh water shortage is one of the main problems facing this area, especially Lamu East, and that’s why we are working on how to draw water from River Tana, treat it and have it used by our people,” Twaha said.
