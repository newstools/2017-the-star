Elders from Western have said big-shot politicians from the region have ignored them and continue to lead the community astray. Luhya Elders’ Forum chairman Patrick Wangamati yesterday said politicians with presidential ambitions have sidelined elders when it comes to socioeconomic and political matters. “They keep telling us elders are soliciting bribes from those who want to be President any time we talk about the unity and welfare of the community. Elders have now left them alone,” he told the Star on the phone. Wangamati (pictured) said the community is not stable politically because senior politicians disregard the advice of elders on serious issues concerning the community. He said ANC leader and NASA founder Musalia Mudavadi, Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang’ula, UDP’s Cyrus Jirongo and Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli must be able to work together.
