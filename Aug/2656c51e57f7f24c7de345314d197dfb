The EACC yesterday quizzed Nairobi Finance executive Gregory Mwakanongo and chief Finance officer Luke Gatimu over &ldquo;questionable payments&rdquo; to a legal firm.Mwakanongo and Gatimu allegedly paid Sh71 million to Koceyo and Co Advocates between January and July.Gatimu denied he was at the Integrity Centre, saying he was in his office.Mwakanongo did not return calls, but sources at the commission said the two met with detectives at the EACC offices.According to an internal memo dated July 20, county attorney Gad Awuonda complained to Mwakanongo about the &ldquo;irregular&rdquo; payments that were made to the firm without the department&rsquo;s approval.&ldquo;It has come to the knowledge of the Legal department that since January 2017 to date, payments totalling Sh71.8 million have been made to Koceyo and Co Advocates,&rdquo; Awuonda said in the memo.&ldquo;This was revealed when we requested a schedule of payments made on account of legal fees and decretal [decrees] for the financial year 2016-17.&rdquo;He said the county legal officers had been subjected to &ldquo;embarrassing&rdquo; arrests by EACC detectives over the payments, yet the department did not approve them.&ldquo;You recall that the Nairobi county assembly in its audit report for the year ended June 30, 2015, falsely alleged that the county attorney was authorising expenditure of a substantial amount of legal fees &mdash; including payments of lawyers acting for the county assembly and the governor,&rdquo; he said.According to the payments&rsquo; schedule seen by the Star, City Hall paid Sh596.7 million to legal firms between January 3 and June 30.Payments include Sh5.1 million to Momanyi Associates, Sh24.3 million to Koceyo and Co Advocates and Sh3 million to Akide and Co Advocates.According to an audit report released by Auditor General Edward Ouko in November last year, City Hall could not account for Sh1.1 billion paid to legal firms.The Nairobi government spent Sh1.1 billion in legal fees, the 2014-15 Auditor General&rsquo;s report says.However, Sh134 million paid to four firms and the county&rsquo;s Legal department had no supporting documents, raising suspicions the money could have been misused.In 2014-15, law firms whose payments are being questioned include Mosyoki Mogaka &amp; Company Advocates, which got Sh5.4 million, Momanyi and Associates (Sh60 million), C W Ngala (Sh27 million) and Kaceyo and Company (Sh5 million). The Legal department spent Sh36.6 million.
