After failing to persuade some candidates contesting the same posts to step down, NASA will unveil its preferred line-up during its final rally at Uhuru Park on Saturday.The opposition could lose some seats, which it otherwise would have easily won, because it is fielding multiple candidates from affiliate parties, thus splitting the vote.The parties &mdash; ODM, Wiper, Ford Kenya, ANC and CCM &mdash; have fielded candidates for most seats, facing Jubilee, which has only one candidate for every position.But Nairobi ODM chairman George Aladwa said NASA is leaving nothing to chance and will release its list of preferred candidates on Saturday.&ldquo;We have been weighing the candidates in terms of their strength in specific areas and we have come up with a line-up,&rdquo; he said.We&rsquo;ll choose the strongestSpeaking on the phone yesterday, Aladwa said the parties have agreed to share both MCA and MP seats based on the candidate and party strength.&ldquo;We have been seeing them [candidates] on the campaign trail and we know who is strong and who is weak. So wait for Saturday,&rdquo; he said.According to Aladwa, NASA aims to capture at least 14 of the 17 MP seats in the capital, with 10 going to ODM, three to Wiper and one to ANC.The same formula will apply in sharing the 85 MCA slots, he said.&ldquo;Jubilee can only manage to win in three constituencies, that is Roysambu, Kasarani and Dagoretti South. We are putting in more efforts to win Starehe as well,&rdquo; he said.Aladwa did not reveal which wards and constituencies will be given to each affiliate party.But insiders say Wiper will get Lang&rsquo;ata, Embakasi South and Kamukunji constituencies.ANC&rsquo;s Elizabeth Ongoro will be NASA&rsquo;s sole candidate for Ruaraka, according to the source.Raila Odinga&rsquo;s ODM will have candidates in Starehe, Embakasi North, Embakasi East, Embakasi West, Embakasi Central, Kibra, Dagoretti North, Westlands, Makadara and Mathare constituencies.Exaggerated strongholdsBut Nairobi Jubilee chairman Sanctus Ndegwa dismissed NASA&rsquo;s target as &ldquo;an exaggeration&rdquo;.He said the ruling party is sure of winning at least nine MP seats.&ldquo;Surely, that is exaggeration, they can&rsquo;t win 14. We are strong in nine constituencies and they are strong in eight. And that is the fact,&rdquo; he said.Ndegwa said Jubilee will win in Roysambu, Kasarani, Dagoretti South, Lang&rsquo;ata, Embakasi West, Starehe, Embakasi South, Embakasi Central and Kamukunji.
