The battle for the lucrative post of Nairobi county assembly speaker has started in earnest, even before the IEBC publishes the names of the election victors in the Kenya Gazette.At least five people, including the incumbent, Alex Magelo, have expressed interest in the speaker's seat. The speaker is the head of the legislative arm of the county government and presides over the county assembly sittings.Deputy speaker Ken Ngondi, county public service board vice chairperson Vesca Kangongo and outgoing Karura MCA Kamau Thuo are also in the race.There are reports the county chief of staff George Wainaina is also interested.Magelo was elected in 2013, when the then Cord had a majority in the assembly - 43 against Jubilee's 42. He joined Jubilee but lost the party ticket for Kajiado West MP during the primaries.This time round Jubilee has 45 seats out of 85, giving the candidate who will be endorsed by the ruling party the upper hand.Magelo said he will bank on his track record in seeking reelection.&ldquo;I worked very well with both sides of the House and we did not have problems like the ones we saw in other assemblies,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Our members conducted business in a hall with no proper security and communication equipment. But now, we have a state-of-the art chamber that no any other county chamber can match.&rdquo; Ngondi, the outgoing Kware MCA, is a staunch NASA member and is likely to have a difficult time persuading the Jubilee members to support him.He says, however, he has worked well with the members of the first assembly and hopes he will be the next speaker because of his leadership qualities.&ldquo;It is not an issue of NASA or Jubilee having the majority. It is about what a person will offer. I think I have done well for the last years I have been in this position,&rdquo; he said.According to the Constitution, the IEBC has to gazette the names of all the elected members before they are sworn in. After they take the oath of office, they will then elect the speaker and deputy speaker.The first sitting of the assembly will be convened by the governor, who will have to be sworn in before the MCAs.
