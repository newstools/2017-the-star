Nyali MP-elect Mohammed Ali has distanced himself from a bid by legislators to block SRC's new salary structure. The former journalist said on his Facebook page he will not support plans by MPs to increase their salaries. "I have fought for equality and fairness through[out] my career and my first move as a parliamentarian will not be to enrich myself," he posted on Wednesday. Parliamentary Service Commission member Gladys Wanga told journalists that SRC's decision to slash salaries will demean MPs. "MPs will be humiliated and reduced to beggars like in the past where they depended on incentives from the executive," the Homa Bay woman rep-elect said on Wednesday. She came under fire from Kenyans on social media who termed the remarks shameful.

But the Nyali legislator asked Kenyans to count his vote against the move. "Forty per cent of my countrymen live
on an average of Sh10,000 or less. I do not see the purpose of an
increment without ensuring that we create a legal framework for our
countrymen to generate wealth FIRST. Count my vote against this," he added. Ali, formerly of KTN, won the Nyali MP seat on an independent ticket.
