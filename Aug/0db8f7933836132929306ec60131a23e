North MP-elect Annie Wanjiku has said she will be a servant leader, and will deliver fast and efficient services. “I am
humbled by the confidence you showed by electing me as your MP. [I] promise
not to let you down as we team up together to develop our constituency,” she said. Wanjiku spoke on Saturday at
various stopovers in the constituency as she thanked residents for electing her. "My first
duty shall be conducting meetings from sub-locational level to discuss the challenges you're facing," she said. "It is you who will make the
decision of priority projects that you
would like us to pursue first. Unlike the former regimes, I will not
disappoint because I will spend most of
my time on the ground." She
promised to push for the tarmacking of Kairi-Mataara road, even if it will take camping at State House.
