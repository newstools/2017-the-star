Kikuyu elders and preachers have prayed under a mugumo tree and sent a sheep into Mt Kenya forest to carry away evil and ensure peaceful polls. In a cleansing offering on Thursday, they sent the sheep to take away the bad deeds the community might have committed. All the sheep’s orifices were sealed so that the evil, now contained in the animal, could not escape. The animal was then sent into the wild to die. “This is a sign the sheep has now cleansed the country and the people will be peaceful during and after the election,” organiser Samwel Kamitha said. All women told to stay away. Only men conducted the ceremony and only the men were allowed to pray. The prayer is so powerful, according to the Kikuyu traditions, that they hope God will answer instantly. The election is on Tuesday. Kamitha said the ritual is always done in the forest, where he said there is “life” and under a mugumo tree, which was used by the forefathers to give offerings to God. “This kind of ceremony has never happened in the country,” Kamitha said. He urged Kenyans to coexist as they have done before the election. Kamitha said an election should not polarise the country along ethnic lines. Ruth Engesani, who organises prayers around Mt Kenya, urged Kenyans to maintain peace during this time and be their brothers’ keepers. She said peace can prevail if Kenyans see each other as brothers and sisters and reject tribal thinking that might cause violence.
