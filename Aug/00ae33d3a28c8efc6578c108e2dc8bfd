Nandi Governor Stephen Sang has dissolved the County Health Management Board, Hospital Committees and suspended CEC for Health. Other senior staffs in the department of health and sanitation were also suspended to pave way for graft probe. According to the Governor, this is to pave way for the investigation of the alleged loss of revenue collected by the health department. “Mathew Rotich, the County Executive Committee Member (CEC) for Health and Sanitation, together with his Chief Officer, Dr. Edward Serem and the County Director of Health Dr. Daniel Kemboi have been suspended with immediate effect,” Sang said in a statement. Sang also said he has instructed the county internal audit to carry out a detailed report on revenue collected in the last four years. The County Health Management Board had eight members. A total of 40 senior officers are affected by the suspension. Among those dissolved include Kapsabet and Nandi Hills County Referral Hospitals and sub-county hospital committees. “County Government of Nandi has dissolved all the sub county hospital committees which were constituted through Gazette Notice No. 4545,” the statement dated 24 August read. The Chief Officer in charge of Tourism Elzeba Jemutai will also take over as the Acting Health Chief Officer. Sang said the suspensions take effect immediately. On Monday, Sang asked the EACC to carry out a lifestyle audit of all senior county staff. He said this is part of his new measures to fight corruption. “Under my administration, public resources shall be prudently utilized not tolerate any case of corruption," he said.
