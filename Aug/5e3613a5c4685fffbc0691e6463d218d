Francis Kimemia was on Monday sworn in as the second governor of Nyandarua County, marking the end of the region’s first boss in the era of devolution, Governor Daniel Waithaka Mwangi. With Governor Mwangi’s exit will also come the departure of veteran newsroom hound and pioneer in devolved communication in Nyandarua, Eliud Miring’uh, who has served as the former’s Director of Governor’s Press Service. I first met Miring’uh in August 2015, when I reported for duty as Nyandarua’s Director of Communication and Public Relations. The Kenyan public is wont to accuse county governments of many things, but I will forever remember Nyandarua for providing me an opportunity to learn and serve in a space that I might never claim as my own, by birth. I had been attracted to Nyandarua by the legendary tales about JM Kariuki, the maverick politician whose tragic end in 1975 epitomizes the continuing struggles of our nation. Then, also, my clergyman dad had – in the 1980s – briefly ministered in Njabini, in Southern Nyandarua, returning with moving accounts of an area that closely mirrored the former White Highlands in which we had grown up in Kenya’s North Rift region. Without knowing, or bribing anyone, I was now at the heart of communicating the promise of devolution to JM’s people; our people. As one of the counties that was experimenting with having someone solely dedicated to looking after the governor’s reputation and another to fend for departments, I found Miring’uh eager to make our shared contributions work, even when the pioneering spirit in him was at times keen to exert itself. I will remember Miring’uh for three things. Firstly, he knew Kenya, and not just Nyandarua, like the back of his hand. When not pressed by a deadline or any other such thing, Miring’uh could regale a visitor to his office with tales of his many years in the media industry, people, issues and events in our contemporary affairs. This strong sense of history would come in handy whenever he needed to tweak or pitch a story, particularly when outlining Nyandarua’s current status vis-Ã -vis other counties in the former Central Province. To understand Nyandarua’s evolving story, with or without Governor Waithaka, it seems to me that future generations of Kenyans will still need to befriend history, particularly the life and times of the late JM and his space in the wider Kenyan project. Secondly, Miring’uh was meticulous about documenting the story of devolution. With limited resources, he built a database of pictures, text and statistics about anything he considered important for the County Government, a task in which I have supported him for the past three years. I must add, at this stage, that nothing he did would have been possible without his support staff – Peter Kamau, Reuben Nyinge and Charles Wanyeki – and the countless interns that have served with us. The database and relevant publications would come in handy on several occasions, particularly when the Council of Governors, the National Government and other development partners would come calling. Mention any sector in Nyandarua, and Miring’uh would talk about it off-head, or provide a holding statement in a few minutes. His forward-looking nature would again be apparent when we launched Nyandarua Today, the County Government’s first newspaper. Initially an initiative of the Department of Communication, Legal, ICT and Intergovernmental Relations under my former supervisor – Engineer Wilson Kigwa – we roped in Miring’uh so that he could take care of his boss’ interests. Together, we also launched Nyandarua’s first public communication policy, and drafted a bill to support it. The challenge for Nyandarua, as indeed other counties, will be to preserve these pioneering contributions, particularly for institutional memory. Finally, Miring’uh was a citizen of the world. With his strong professional and academic background across and outside Kenya, Miring’uh was acutely aware of his space beyond the confines of Nyandarua. While there were times when some around him felt he was too strong-willed for his own good, Miring’uh would take no prisoners in his work, with an eye on life beyond his office. In any case, he had been there, done and seen it all, and worn the T-shirt. “Masai,” he would say, “kazi lazima ifanyike.” Mzee, blessings in the years ahead, wherever they may lead you.
