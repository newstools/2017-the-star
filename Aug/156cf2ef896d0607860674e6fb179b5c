Police in Kaloleni are investigating Wednesday’s election rigging claims, Kilifi police boss Wachira Mathenge has said. Three IEBC Presiding Officers were arrested by Jubilee, Kadu Asili and Wiper candidates at a hotel in Kaloleni. They accused the officers of tampering with election materials. The candidates, led by Kilifi Jubilee governor candidate Gideon Mung’aro, raided the hotel and arrested the three. Two escaped. The candidates accused the presiding officers of trying to rig the elections in favour of incumbent Amason Kingi. On Thursday Mathenge urged witnesses to volunteer information. “We have opened an inquiry file over the incident and we urge anyone who witnessed to report to the Kaloleni police station and record a statement,” he said outside Kilifi North tallying centre at Pwani University. He said the three presiding officers recorded statements and were released. Vote tallying resumed after being suspended on Wednesday.
