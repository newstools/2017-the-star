People living near Muguga forest, Kikuyu constituency, are yet to come to terms with the fact that the body they found in Muguga forest was that of the electoral agency ICT boss Chris Msando. His body was found a few metres from that of Carol Ngumbu, 21, a KMTC student. “We left the police to investigate who they were, only to be shocked on Monday to hear the news that it was Msando,” said resident Kevin Waweru on Wednesday. Since the incident, more than 50 people have been combing through the forest in search of more bodies. Community Forest Association chairman Simon Kamonde said the forest, which is more than 5,000 hactares, is in the middle of Muguga, Nderi, Nguriunditu, Renguti and Kamangu villages. He asked the government to erect a fence around the forest.
