Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto, Kuresoi South MP Zakayo Cheruiyo and Mogotio MP Hellen Sambili were among the big names floored in the August 8 election. Rutto of Chama Cha Mashinani ditched the ruling Jubilee Party for the opposition's National Super Alliance. According to the provisional results as at 1pm yesterday, National Assembly Deputy Speaker Joyce Laboso was in the lead with175,932 votes against Rutto's 85,863. Rutto served as the chairman of the Council of Governors for two terms. Analysts say Rutto’s decision to join NASA fatally complicated his hopes for reelection and boosted Jubilee’s chances of reclaiming full control of the South Rift from the abrasive politician. “The implications were directly felt in the Bomet governor race, and in Deputy President William Ruto’s influence across the Kalenjin constituency in the Rift Valley,” said Peter Toroitich, a political analyst based in Nakuru. Rutto fell out with DP Ruto soon after the 2013 general election. It started with accusations by Ruto’s supporters that Rutto was undermining URP by meeting Kanu officials. The row escalated into a power struggle, with Rutto accusing Ruto of political intolerance and abusing elected leaders. Cheruiyot, popularly known as ZK, lost to retired teacher Joseph Tonui in Kuresoi South, Nakuru county. Cheruiyo was MP between 1997 and 2003, and a powerful Internal Security PS during President Daniel arap Moi’s regime. He enjoyed overwhelming support in 2013, but this time the circumstances were different. Former assistant minister Sambili lost to Daniel Tuitoek. She ditched JP to run as an independent after she was defeated in the primaries.
