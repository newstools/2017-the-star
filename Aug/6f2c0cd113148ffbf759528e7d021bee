Some governors have paid striking nurses July salaries, despite a collective threat to withhold the money until they call off their strike. Half of the counties have paid the health workers while some have already handed out payslips with a promise to remit the money. “There were delays by the National Treasury to remit money to county governments, but nurses in at least half of the counties have been paid,” Kenya National Union of Nurses deputy secretary general Maurice Opetu told the Star yesterday. Nurses have not worked for 72 days now since June 5. They are demanding the registration of their collective bargaining agreement. The deal was disowned by both the Salaries and Remuneration Commission and the Council of Governors. The strike is likely to drag on into September because the nurses must wait until a new CoG is reconstituted. The CoG negotiating team might also be reconstituted because some of the negotiators could change jobs after 23 governors lost their seats in the August 8 General Election. “We are waiting for communication from the CoG as we plan how to go on with the talks,” Opetu said. The union also restructured its team to include secretary general Seth Panyako, who vied for the Kakamega senate seat on an ODM ticket but lost. Yesterday, the CoG accused the union of dragging its feet. “KNUN promised to consult its members on the offer before the next meeting. It has not given the negotiating team any feedback,” CoG said in a statement. The union has also not nominated members to work with county public service boards and human resources committees to embark on job description exercise that starts on Monday in Nairobi.
