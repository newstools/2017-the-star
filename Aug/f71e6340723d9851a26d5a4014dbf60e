PSV operators yesterday said they are losing up to 40 per cent of their income due to bribes and congestion caused by unregulated licensing of new matatus.They appealed for help to Governor Mike Sonko, Deputy Governor Polycarp Igathe, city police commander Japheth Koome and NTSA director general Francis Meja.The governor promised to address the concerns and ordered inspectorate chief officer Francis Munyambu to put the department in order.&ldquo;We said city askaris should not harass anybody, should not beat or kill people. If a matatu operator has broken the law, arrest him or her,&rdquo; Sonko said.Matatu Owners Association chairman Simon Kimutai said they face harassment by traffic police and city inspectorate officers, bureaucracy in doing business and cartels in the sector.&ldquo;County inspectorate officers are targeting vehicles by impounding [them]. They give you a window to pay Sh5,000 and if you don&rsquo;t, your vehicle is impounded and you have to pay Sh10,000 fine in court,&rdquo; he said.Streamline PSV sectorKimutai urged Sonko to streamline the sector.He asked for more holding areas, picking and dropping stages and to reduce seasonal matatu parking fee.&ldquo;There is interference in the allocation of these spaces with officers asking for bribes for one to be given a space. This has led to [traffic] jams in most roads as matatus pick passengers along the road,&rdquo; he said.Edwin Mukabana, a director of Kenya Bus Services, said a lack of rules on entry of new matatus has contributed to the high number of vehicles and congestion, so investors lose money.&ldquo;We must reduce the number of matatus to reduce congestion. We make good policies but we do not follow them through,&rdquo; he said.Sonko promises to helpOn the high parking and impounding fee, the city boss promised to reduce the charges by 30 per cent.&ldquo;We are waiting for MCAs to reconvene. I will ask them to amend the Finance Act so that we can have these changes,&rdquo; he said.During campaigns, Sonko pledged to reduce daily parking fees from Sh300 to Sh140.Responding to accusations that his officers were high-handed, Meja said all the reforms they had brought were for the good of the industry. He attempted to allay fears that the proposed Bus Rapid Transport would lead to loss of jobs, saying it would create more jobs.Koome said no traffic officer has been instructed to take bribes and many have been relieved of their duties over graft.
