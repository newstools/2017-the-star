Residents from Mavoko constituency have laughed off
former Kibwezi MP Kalembe Ndile’s threat to challenge the parliamentary results
in court. They said Ndile should concede defeat and stop
wasting people’s time and resources by filing a case. “Ndile was defeated in August 8 elections fair and
square. He has no reason to petition the results. He will still lose the case
even if he proceeds,” residents spokesperson Paul Mwendwa said. They spoke to the Star in Athi River town on
Wednesday. Ndile who contested for the parliamentary seat on
the Jubilee Party ticket said together with Michael Mutuku (ODM) and Phylip
Kilonzo (Wiper), they will move to court to challenge the MP results. The trio together with independent candidates
Justina Wamae and Jacqueline Mutindi lost to incumbent MP Patrick Makau of Wiper who got 49,728 votes. A total of 82,252 votes were cast. Ndile was second with 16,444 votes,
Mutuku 9,460, Kilonzo 4,683, Wamae 1,251 and Mutindi 686 votes. Makau said, however, it is Ndile’s constitutional right to
move to court. He said the politician has a history of filing
petitions in courts whenever he is defeated in the election. “Ndile went to court in 2007 after he lost in the
Embakasi parliamentary by-elections after Mugabe Were’s death, he again filed a
petition after losing the Kibwezi West MP seat in 2013. He can go ahead and
file a petition in court against me after losing the 2017 Mavoko parliamentary
seat if he so wishes,” Makau told the Star on the phone. The residents said they would reelect Makau a
hundred times if the Mavoko parliamentary polls were to be repeated. “Ndile did nothing to Mavoko residents when he was
the director of Water Services Regulatory Board despite the water problems we
undergo, he didn’t install even an inch of water pipe to the residents,” Mwendwa said.
