Legal eagles representing President Uhuru Kenyatta are burning the midnight oil to comb through the 25,000-page petition filed by NASA leader Raila Odinga. A pool of Jubilee lawyers led by lead counsel Fred Ngatia are working at a secret location along Valley Road with scores of support staff to analyse Raila’s evidence and prepare a response before midnight tomorrow. There were indications that Ahmednasir Abdullahi could beef up the Jubilee team, but the Nairobi Law Monthly publisher said he won’t. “I am not representing any of the parties,” Ahmednasir said when contacted by the Star yesterday. According to the Supreme Court Act, President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto must file their response within four days upon filing of the petition. NASA filed their papers at the Supreme Court a few minutes to midnight of August 17. Ngatia, who was also Uhuru’s lawyer in 2013 election petition by Raila, will be lead counsel in court. Jubilee has also brought on board some of the finest lawyers working behind the scenes to prepare a response. IEBC through its team of lawyers is working under tight schedule to meet strict court timeliness in the petition. “We will definitely file our response before midnight Thursday, we are working around the clock,” said IEBC lawyer Paul Nyamodi. Today, the electoral agency is expected to file with the Supreme Court the legal instruments that were used to declare President Uhuru Kenyatta the winner of the August 8 poll. Under the law, IEBC is required within 48 hours upon filing of a presidential petition, file certified copies of the documents used to declare a presidential result. The statutory documents that will be filed include the Forms 34B that are used by constituency returning officers to aggregate presidential results from polling stations. There are 40,883 Forms 34A, 290 Forms 34B and one Form 34C. Forms 34A are used by presiding officers to tabulate presidential results at the polling stations.
