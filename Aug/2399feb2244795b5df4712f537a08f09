A boda boda operator and his two children killed in Kapsowar two weeks ago have been buried, amid calls to arrest the killer. Mourners led by former IG of Police David Kimaiyo (pictured) on Thursday accused police in Marakwet West of failing to conduct proper investigations. Solomon Koech and two of his children, aged nine and six months, were brutally murdered on August 5 in their Kapsowar home. Koech’s wife was seriously injured. Kimaiyo said he spoke to IG of Police Joseph Boinnet to order a probe into the killing, but no action has been taken. He said Boinnet assured him that thorough investigations will be conducted. “Our local police officers should not take crime lightly. They should admit they don’t have the capacity to investigate this incident and seek help from ballistics experts in Nairobi,” Kimaiyo said. He spoke during the burial of the man and children in Kipturure village, Marakwet West. “We are asking experts in the police service to track down this suspect through his mobile phone. He is known to locals,” Kimaiyo said.
