US President Donald Trump has said he is
scrapping two business councils after more bosses quit over his handling
of violent clashes in Virginia. Trump said: "Rather than
putting pressure on the businesspeople of the Manufacturing Council
& Strategy & Policy Forum, I am ending both." It comes after the heads of post-it maker 3M and Campbell Soup announced their resignations on Wednesday. Eight business leaders have withdrawn after the far-right rally last weekend. Businesses have been under pressure to distance themselves from Trump over his handling of the clashes. Despite
belatedly condemning the white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups that
rallied in Charlottesville, on Tuesday he appeared to defend the rally's
organisers. Trump has previously dismissed the chief executive
resignations, saying the business leaders were "not taking their jobs
seriously as it pertains to this country".
