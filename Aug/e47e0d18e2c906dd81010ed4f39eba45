He asked Raila to accept the results or run for a lesser seat such as Kibra MP. “Don’t continue holding 45 million Kenyans [to ransom]. Concede and relax so that many Kenyans can respect you more. The results were credible since the observers also okayed them,” Waweru said. Nyokabi urged the opposition leaders to respect the will of Kenyans since the country is great than an individual. “Kindly don’t burn this country since we are more than 45 million Kenyans, including your children and relatives.
