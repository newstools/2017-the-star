Minor hitches marked voting in Kakamega yesterday even as the county recorded a high voter turnout. There were long queues outside polling stations spread across the region and some started to form as early as 4am. However, some of the voters’ names were missing from the KIEMS kits and IEBC officials did not have passwords to validate names of those whose details could not be identified bio-metrically. Voting at Ivonda Primary School, Ikolomani constituency, was delayed for more than two hours, with poll clerks blaming the hitch on some kits which took time to boot up. Despite the few challenges, voting went on smoothly without incidents.  There was heavy presence of armed police officers in all polling stations, while others in vehicles patrolled the streets in urban centres. Some voters did not know their streams within the polling centres. But they were instructed to send a text message to 70000 to enable them to join the right queue. But they complained the process was time-consuming and slowed down the exercise. At Sichirayi polling station, Lurambi constituency, IEBC officials could not validate names of voters who could not be identified biometrically through KIEMS gadgets. “The password we were given is expired. We identified them alpha-numerically but we cannot validate their names on the kits because we don’t have the pin,” said deputy presiding officer only identified as Nelima. But returning officer for Lurambi, Elida Adhiambi, said the officers could have used a wrong password because an expired one can be replaced. At Malinya Primary School, where Ford Kenya governor candidate Boni Khalwale voted at 7.25am, names of two  voters – Naomi Khasiali, who is Khalwale’s aunt, and Calvin Butichi –were missing from the register.
