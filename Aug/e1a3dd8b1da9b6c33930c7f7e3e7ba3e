The IEBC has published the full list of elected members of the National Assembly and MCAs. But the special gazette notice on Wednesday excluded Kikuyu MP Kimani Ichungâ€™wah who was elected unopposed. The slot for Kitutu Chache South MP, whose Jubilee candidate died weeks before the August 8 general election, was also blank. The declaration was made in line with Articles 88(4), 93, 95, 97 (1) (a) and 101 (1) of the constitution. "They received the majority of the votes cast in the election and complied with the provisions of the Elections Act, 2011 and the Constitution." Last Friday, the commission published the final results and names of the 47 Governors, woman representatives, and senators. Parliament will hold its first sitting on September 9, one month after the general election. The President will name the place and date for the first sitting in a notice in the Kenya Gazette. According to the list, only 23 women were elected MP in a poll of 290. Only three women made it to the Senate where there were 47 contestable slots. The August Houses are yet to comply with the constitutional requirement of the two-thirds gender rule. The constitution says IEBC has to gazette the names of all elected members before they are sworn-in. The MPs are then required to take oath of office before proceeding to elect the Speaker and Deputy Speaker. The gazette notice doesn't include nominated members of the National Assembly and the Senate.
