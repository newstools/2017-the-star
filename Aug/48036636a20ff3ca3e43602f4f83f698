Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong yesterday cast his vote at Busia Township Primary School polling station, Teso South constituency. Addressing the press afterward, Ojaamong said it is now up to the voters to decide who they want to be their governor,  MCA, MP, senator and woman representative. “I am impressed with the speed at which the exercise is taking place.  If the trend continues the way it is going at various polling stations across the county, then we are bound to get the results by 9pm. “ Counting votes  per  polling station is not  a difficult task, Ojaamong said.  He was accompanied by his wife Judy. At St Teresa  polling station, Matayos constituency, distraught voter Hellen Omondi almost created a scene after she was told her name was missing from the register. Elsewhere, Funyula MP Paul Otuoma, who is running for governor as an independent,  called on security officers to be on high alert. He said many criminal gangs operate in the county.
