The July edition of the Hacks/Hackers Nairobi saw an audience of forty gathered in the Nairobi Garage space to discuss how ordinary citizens, journalists, civic technologists and the digital media community can use new and existing technologies to fight fake news.  Fake news may not be a new phenomenon, having previously been labelled as ‘propaganda’ and ‘yellow journalism’, but the prevalence of new media and the heightened tension around Kenya’s upcoming general election means that there has been a lot of ‘noise’ online and in the news, some of which appears to be deliberately designed to misinform. With this in mind, the session, whose theme was Digital Democracy: Using Tech To Fight Fake News, was opened by Code for Kenya lead Catherine Gicheru, who explained that the discussion would revolve around how fake news was being used in the context of the Kenyan elections, and how technology can and has been used to fight it. The first speaker was Allan Kamau from Portland Communications, a strategic communications company that has produced a survey on fake news in Kenya.  Allan Kamau of Portland Communications Titled ‘The reality of Fake News in Kenya’, the report looks at where Kenyans get their news from, and how much trust they have in mainstream media and social media, and as it turns out, traditional mediaâ€Š—â€ŠTV, newspapers and radioâ€Š—â€Šremains the most trusted source of information, but Kenyans are consuming an increasing amount of news on social media, some of which contains fake information. According to the Portland report, nine out of ten respondents said that they had seen some form of fake news related to elections. The internet, Allan explained, is designed to spread information. Anyone can publish what they want, so it’s hard to find the truth. He further added that the fact that this information is usually shared by people they trustâ€Š—â€Šusually friends and familyâ€Š—â€Šmakes it more likely that they will believe something even though it is provably false.  Data from Portland Communications’ research Musembi Mutisya, the lead data analyst at the Election Observation Group (ELOG), was next. He explained that ELOG was spearheading an effort to counteract fake news with open data on elections, sharing verified information.  Musembi Mutisya of ELOG makes his presentation ELOG and their partners have a network of over 6,000 observers on the ground to monitor elections, and they have a system in place to collect information related to elections that could be of importance to the electorate. Before sharing this information, ELOG verifies it to make sure that it is accurate, and informs the relevant parties who may need to respond to it, which in this case is the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission. A lot of sites related to the election may not be factual, but they get a lot of traffic, Musembi explained, giving the example of ‘Uhuru for Us’ and ‘The Real Raila’, which have placed ads on Facebook, Twitter, and even Instagram. The information they contain may appear legitimate, but the fact that the individuals behind it are not known means that this information needs to be handled very carefully. Next up was Julian Kamau, the Social Media Lead at the Standard Group. She focused on the various methods that they have put in place to verify the information that they receive, particularly from citizen journalists who use their ‘Ureport’ platform.  Julian Kamau of the Standard explains how they verify the information they receive online One story that the Standard did that drew a lot of attention was a report alleging that the Eritrean government had ordered men in the country to marry two wives. The story was shared widely, drawing attention from all over the world, including from the Government of Eritrea, which demanded a retraction. Given the nature of the news they cover, especially around election-related matters, journalists from The Standard and from other newsrooms as well are learning how to differentiate between what’s real and what’s not, and as Julian explained, the biggest challenge is that everyone has a voice online that’s hard to verify. As such, there is a real need for a tool that media houses can use to verify information that they receive online. The next speaker was Esther Wandia, who is a web administrator at The Star newspaper. The Star has a crowdsourced citizen journalism platform, Star Reports, that collects information through an Android app. Established in 2012, Star Reports allows users to create and share their stories online. Stories that are deemed newsworthy are circulated in-house and investigated before they are published on the main Star website.  Esther Wandia of The Star/Radio Africa Group From Esther’s observations, many fake news websites have links that look legit, and are designed to look like real media outlets’ websites. Such sites can fool a casual observer into thinking that it’s the real deal, meaning they are very likely to share the content without interrogating it.  The audience at Hacks/Hackers Nairobi’s July meetup The next presentation was by Code for Africa software developer James Chege, who demonstrated how images are often rehashed for stories. He identified one photo that was used in a story about a Ghanaian election and again in a story about delays at a Kenyan polling station.  James Chege of Code for Africa demonstrates how to use Google Reverse Image Search to fact-check photos used in the news Using Google Image Search, he was able to reverse-search the image to identify that it was actually from South Africa. He was also able to identify when the image was originally published, and various other instances where it was used. The next speaker was Odanga Madung, co-founder and Data Science lead at Odipo Dev, a research consultancy that has recently published the results from a 3-month study into fake news in Kenya. A growing number of Kenyans is getting their information from social media, and Odipo Dev’s research showed that they were focused on getting information from mainstream news outlets on those platforms. While the research was able to identify links shared on mainstream social networks, ‘dark’ networks such as WhatsApp have become the main channel for mass distribution of fake news stories. WhatsApp is fast, simple, and much more intimate compared to other networks such as Facebook or Twitter.  Odanga Madung of Odipo Dev presents findings from a 3-month study into fake news in Kenya As Odanga explained, a number of fake news websites tend to have links similar to those of regular websites, but with a slight difference. They also have a lot of ads, sometimes more ads than actual content, showing that their intent is to make money from these stories as well as to misinform. The rise of the fake news phenomenon ultimately reveals our character. Its goal is to trick you into sharing the content through a combination of psychology and ease of distribution. It appeals to confirmation bias, where a story shows you something you may have suspected but have never proven. Given the proliferation of mobile devices, one link shared on one social media channel could go all the way around the world before the whole truth puts on its shoes. Countering the phenomenon of fake news needs constant vigilance and fact-checking, as the panel showed. A number of tools exist, such as Check by Meedan to verify breaking news stories, and Google Reverse Image Search when it comes to stories with photos. It means that you need to know what a fake link looks like, or doing a quick search see if any other news outlets have published the story you’re reading. Ultimately, the task of fighting fake news lies with those in the business of producing legitimate news, as well as the audience that consumes this information. Before sending that ‘forwarded as received’ message, check to make sure that it’s from a legitimate source.
