THAT the General Election saw more than 388,000 votes rejected left many Kenyans with more questions than answers. Many have raised concerns on whether the Wafula Chebukati- led IEBC conducted adequate voter education or not. Word has it that most unenlightened and youthful first-time voters were mostly the victims who contributed to the rejected votes. Our mole has told Corridors that some IEBC clerks are also to blame for incompetence, since none on various occasions was available to offer any assistance to voters faced with the challenge of casting the vote.  It is said many voters dropped the papers in the six ballot boxes without care after marking them wrongly. ************  STILL on matters IEBC, some election clerks were heard complaining about the manner they were treated before and during the voting exercise. Word has it that some were complaining the commission did not provide them with food or give them time to buy food since Monday evening in preparation for rigorous Tuesday voting exercise. Our mole has told Corridors some presiding officers collapsed in the process, but when asked what the problem was after recovering, they expressed disappointment with the IEBC’s treatment of its temporary staff. One of the victims said she had not had a meal from Monday evening until Tuesday dusk, when they were given a loaf of bread and soda for supper. ********** A parliamentary aspirant from Kisii was rushed to hospital after he collapsed on learning that he was trailing his opponent in Tuesday’s General Election. The MP passed out in his house while listening to radio on the vote-counting updates, forcing his family to quickly rush him to a nearby hospital in a bid to save his life. The lawmaker who had invested heavily in the campaigns and was seen dishing out cash on the final stretch, could not believe the news he was hearing about losing the seat he has held for the last 10 years. The MP is reportedly recuperating in a Nairobi hospital, where he was transferred. *********** THEY say politics is the art of the impossible. Well, Vicious propaganda against a woman representative-elect from Nyanza proved futile, despite persistent swipes aimed at projecting her negatively ahead of the election. She is reportedly married elsewhere and sought an elective seat in her paternal county in what some critics felt was intrusion and “against African culture”. The ferocious onslaught on her character hit a snag after she pulled a surprise against a former celebrity to clinch the coveted seat in the 12th Parliament. She proved that marriage is no yardstick to measure leadership capacity.
