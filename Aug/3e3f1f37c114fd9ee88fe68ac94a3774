As Kenyans await the final and formal declaration of the 12th General Election results for six elective offices, starting with the Presidency, it is crucial that the country remains calm. Politicians at all levels must avoid incitement or coded language for conflict. The politicos should exhaust all the lawful dispute resolution mechanisms and abide by the Judiciary’s final rulings. As Chief Justice David Maraga recently announced, judges and magistrates will work at night and on weekends for timely resolution of election disputes, observing the constitutional timelines and “without compromising on the quality of rulings”. He was launching the Bench book on electoral disputes resolution. The politicians should do all that is humanly possible not to turn up the political temperature at this tense time. The lessons of electoral disputes of recent years, especially the descent into the PEV crisis of 2007-08, ought to have been learnt by now. The institution and capacity building of the post-PEV crisis must count for something.
