Tecno mobility which is part of Transsion Holding Limited is aiming to increase its market share in the Kenyan market. According to a report by IDC published in 2015, mobile phone penetration rate in Africa has risen to 80 per cent from six per cent. Market surveys show that currently, Tecno controls an average of 25.3 per cent market share in Sub-Saharan African countries since 2014. Millenials are the main target group of this new device that is to be launched this month. The new series smartphone will host 13MP rear/ 8MP front, F/2.0 dual cameras. In the past decade, the TECNO Mobile brand has enjoyed success especially with its feature and budget smartphone lines across Africa and the Middle-east where mostly youth demographics embrace the offerings of the brand. Stepping up the chase for market share in Africa, TECNO has set her focus on recruiting millennials and campus students and there can&rsquo;t be a better way of doing that than the release of a trendy budget smartphone that costs between Sh 7,000 and Sh 10,000. The standard edition of this new series probably will be priced at only Sh 7,000 coming with a fingerprint sensor, 5.5 inches IPS display and run on latest Android 7.0 Nougart version. The device is expected in the Kenyan market by mid August and will feature a colorful chasis to woo the target market who are the young smartphone consumers.Currently, the African market reached a milestone of 25 million devices in 2015, including 9 million smartphones. Globally the company sold 60 million devices last year while the sale of smartphones manufactured by the company increased by 40 per cent.
