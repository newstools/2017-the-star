Livestock keepers in Kimunyu village Gatundu South have expressed concern over theft of their livestock in the last three weeks. They want the government to intervene to avert further losses. Ten cows, more than 20 goats and 10 sheep have been stolen. Some were rescued after their owners raised the alarm and their neighbours intervened before the thieves made away with them. The latest victim, Humphrey Kigara, yesterday said he almost lost his two cows on Sunday night. He got a quick response from his neighbours. “It was around 3am. I heard a commotion in the cowshed. I found my gate open and the shed empty. With the help of my neighbours, we rescued the animals about a kilometre away,” Kigara told the Star at his Thiririka home yesterday. Three weeks ago, the thieves stole a cow from Kigara’s cousin. Other victims are 95-year-old Muthoni Gacheru, who has lost two cows, and Njeri Mungai, who lost six goats two weeks ago. Residents said nothing has been done even after victims reported to Kimunyu police and Thangari AP officers. But Gatundu deputy county commissioner Stephen Kariuki said he has instructed area chief to convene a public baraza over the matter.
