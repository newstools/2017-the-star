Baringo Senator Gideon Moi has for the second time attended a Jubilee rally uninvited. The rally was hosted by President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto in Kabarnet town. Moi and Ruto are rivals for control of the Rift Valley. Ruto has long been considered the kingping but Moi is very popular. On Tuesday, the senator landed 10 minutes ahead of Uhuru and Ruto. Thousands of residents cheered him, demanding he addresses them. He did not speak but instead shook hands with some Kanu supporters near him. This was the second time the senator attended a Jubilee rally without being invited. On July 9, he attended a church service at AIC Kabartonjo in Baringo North subcounty. On Tuesday, DP Ruto recognised the senator and introduced him before naming other attendants. Moi is facing a tough battle with Jubilee candidate Simon Chelugui, considered a Ruto ally. Both Ruto and Moi say they want to run for President in 2022. The DP said after the election he would return to launch projects. Some residents were critical, saying the Jubilee has had five years to deliver on campaign promises.
