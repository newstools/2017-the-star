NASA has itself to blame for the humiliating defeat by Jubilee, Kitui West MP Francis Nyenze has said. “A divided house must simply fall. We criticised Jubilee when a number of parties folded up and merged but that is where we got it wrong. We should have done the same,” he said. NASA’s affiliate parties fielded their own candidates, dividing their votes and losing to Jubilee in many regions. Nyenze spoke on Saturday in Kitui West when he joined Kitui Senator-elect Enoch Wambua in celebrating his victory at Kyondoni Primary School. He urged the losers to accept defeat to defuse tension. “We must accept the fact that Kenya is greater than an individual. In any competition there must be winners and losers,” Nyenze said. Earlier in the year he was vocal in calling for Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka to be NASA presidential flagbearer.
