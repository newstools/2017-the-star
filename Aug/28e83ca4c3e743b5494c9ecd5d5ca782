The electoral agency yesterday handed over to the Supreme Court the 54,000–page original Forms 34 A, B and C that were used to declare the outcome of August 8 presidential election. Saying it was ready to defend the polls credibility, the IEBC delivered the original forms collected from the 40,883 polling stations countrywide. IEBC chief Ezra Chiloba told journalists soon after the delivery they will be filing their responses to NASA’s suit, that seeks to overturn President Uhuru Kenyatta’s win, tomorrow. Chiloba said soft copies of the election materials have also been availed to the court, to NASA and Uhuru for their perusal in readiness for the hearing of the petition which is expected to begin on Monday next week. The IEBC has already published Forms 34A from 40,883 polling stations on presidential results announced on August 11 when Uhuru was announced winner. “We have brought all original forms used in the election and we have nothing to hide. We are ready to defend ourselves. We are also inviting Kenyans to scrutinise the forms which have been posted on our portal,” Chiloba said. Chiloba, who was accompanied by lawyer Wambua Kilonzo, further said the commission was addressing an incident in which a number of ballot boxes from Embakasi constituency opened. He said boxes can only be opened following a court order and that there was no mischief. “There was an issue when the returning officer was hospitalised. He instructed his deputy to go retrieve the forms, but he did not follow the right procedure and by mistake he opened the ballot boxes,” Chiloba said. NASA wants Uhuru’s win nullified.
