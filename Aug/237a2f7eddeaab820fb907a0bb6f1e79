The first record of Polio is in Africa, displayed on a plaque that once formed part of a frieze in a temple in ancient Egypt. It depicts a man with a withered leg supporting himself with a crutch - a common characteristic of the disease.However it was not until 1789 that British physician Michael Underwood gave it its first clinical description and 1840 when it was recognised as a condition.Since then, there were a number of epidemics world wide which led to the development of the first effective vaccination in 1952 by Dr Jonas Salk. In 1988, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) was launched and since then the number of cases has fallen by 99 percent.The most recent breakthrough in eradicating the disease has come from a group of scientists who have found a way to produce a vaccine with a method using virus like particles (VLPs) which are then grown in plants.VLPs which are similar to viruses but non infectious, are biologically engineered so they do not contain nucleic acid which allows the virus to replicate.This means that although they mimic the behaviour of the virus and stimulate the immune system, they do not cause polio infections.The team of scientists which included Dr Johanna Marsian and Professor Lomonossoff from the John Innes Centre found that the genes that carried the information needed to produce VLPs were infiltrated into the plant tissue which then reproduced large quantities using its own protein expression mechanisms.Professor Lomonossoff said, &ldquo;This is an incredible collaboration involving science, animal virology and structural biology. The question for us now is how to scale it up - we don&rsquo;t want to stop at a lab technique.&rdquo;The tests showed that the poliovirus they developed provided animals with immunity from the disease, paving the way for human vaccines to be produced by plants on a major scale.While Kenya has been free from Polio since 2006, there were outbreaks in 2009, 2011 and 2013 caused by importations of wild poliovirus.In 2013, the Horn of Africa experienced an outbreak that originated in Somalia and reached Dadaab in the north of Kenya resulting in 217 children being paralysed.In response to this, inactivated polioviruses (IPV) was co-administered with oral poliovirus (OPV) in five refugee camps in Dadaab as well as surrounding areas which included 126,000 under fives.Earlier this year, the Ministry of Health began a polio vaccination campaign to help eradicate Polio by 2018. In order to qualify as a polio free country, there must be no recorded cases this year.While current vaccines have been effective, they require large quantities of the virus to be produced. Using the live virus raises the risk of the virus escaping while using the live attenuated or weakened virus maintain polio in the global population.The study was funded by the WHO who are seeking for alternative vaccines that avoid using the live virus as part of an international drive to eradicate the disease worldwide.
