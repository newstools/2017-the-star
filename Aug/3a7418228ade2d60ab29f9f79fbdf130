A woman who needs Sh665,000 for a major surgery has been allegedly abandoned by her family at Joykim Nursing Hospital, a private facility in Embu town. Monica Wanja, 29, from Karurumo village in Embu East, has been at the hospital since May. She was diagnosed with “herniated or prolapsed disk”. She told journalists her two backbone disks slipped, causing pain and discomfort and making her immobile. Wanja said her family, including her husband, has deserted her and she has unsuccessfully tried to reach them. Hospital administrator Purity Kangai said Wanja was admitted after her doctor requested the hospital to allow her in for ease of monitoring as her family raised the funds for the surgery. Kangai urged well-wishers to fund the surgery, saying the hospital will continue accommodating her until she gets help. Wanja has also urged well-wishers to help her get treatment.
