Ford Kenya will be soon having a big party in Bungoma to celebrate its victory of scooping three top county seats, the party’s secretary general Eseli Simiyu has said. Ford Kenya bagged the governor, woman representative and Senate seats along with 25 of the45 MCA positions. Simiyu retained his Tongaren MP seat, as did the party’s county chairman Wafula Wamuiniyi, who won the Kanduyi seat against ODM’s John Makali. The party also retained its Kabuchai MP seat through James Lusweti, but lost its Kimilili constituency seat to Jubilee, where Suleiman Murunga lost to Didimas Baraza. Speaking to the press in his constituency yesterday, Simiyu said the victory calls for a celebration. The party also won the Trans Nzoia governor seat. Simiyu said Bungoma needs to shift from the leadership of incumbent Kenneth Lusaka “which has ridiculed residents who voted for him”. He said winner Wycliffe Wangamati will streamline the county by bringing about real development. “We are going to have a strong government with Ford Kenya that will serve the electorate in a sober and focussed manner,” Simiyu said. Ford Kenya county organising secretary Peter Wakulekha said the party will ensure it serves wananchi with decorum . “We will welcome all stakeholders in the governance process. We will include even those who did not work with us to get these seats. Let not people be scared thinking Ford Kenya will neglect some people and areas,” he said. Wakulekha welcomed losers in the NASA-affiliated parties to work with Ford Kenya.
