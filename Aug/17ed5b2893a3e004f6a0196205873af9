Six months after he was brought to the Kariobangi Sharks to add experience to a talented squad looking to make their top flight bow, Osborne Mondays future at the club is far from certain. The international midfielder, it has emerged, has fallen out with coach William Muluya and has even been giving training at the clubs facilities a wide berth “Monday has not been coming to training at all. It seems his relationship with the coach is irreparable and he probably won’t don the Sharks’ shirt again at least when Muluya is coach,” said a source familiar with the goings on at the club. The source further revealed that Monday was particularly irked at being substituted during one of their GOtv matches and in the company of an unnamed friend, immediately departed the venue of the match not even bothering to board the team’s bus. “It is that bad. Monday probably felt he was being undermined by being replaced and since then he has not been seen,” added the source. Coincidentally in Monday’s absence, Sharks have fared well finding themselves in the GOtv Shield quarter final and only just slipped out of the top five in the Premier League table. Sharks were beaten by Zoo Kericho 3-2 in midweek match, a result that left them seven points off top spot in the formative stages of the second leg. Pascal Pheno, who was later dismissed and Frank Mania scored for Sharks. Meanwhile, Zoo will be sweating over the fitness of forward Bernard Odhiambo, who reportedly limped out of their victory with Sharks, where a double from top striker Nicholas Kipkirui and the winner from Mike Madonya ended Sharks’ unbeaten streak that stretches to nearly a dozen matches in all communications. A statement from the club revealed that the extent of the ankle injury he sustained was due to be known tomorrow. Despite being closer to the drop zone largely due to the poor start to life in the top flight league where they suffered five successive loses, Zoo are 12th in the table 12 points off top spot.
