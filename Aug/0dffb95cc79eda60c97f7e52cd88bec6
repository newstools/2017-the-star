Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi has welcomed his "chief campaigner" President Uhuru Kenyatta to the county for a rally at Karisa Maitha grounds on Wednesday afternoon. Kingi, a severe critic of Uhuru, said the tour will offer him good publicity "as he always mentions my name in his speeches". “The president will be in Kilifi today and that is a plus for me. He cannot make an address without mentioning my name and that is very good for my political campaigns," he said at his residence on Wednesday, when he met members of the Luo and Kamba community living in Kilifi. "My name will trend today in Kilifi so I will campaign in other areas. The more he spends here the more votes I get." The Governor further said they will get more tourists for the first time since the President will be there. “Our tourism died after the government said Kilifi is a hotspot for violence but I thank God the President’s entourage will stay in Kilifi hotels. This is the only positive thing we will get from his visit." Kingi dismissed claims of chaos on election day. “We have been living in peace and you have no other governor except Kingi. Nobody will harm you...the plans to disrupt this election must be defeated by all means. We will prosper as a nation." Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto several trips to the county in their hunt for votes for the general election next Tuesday. Two weeks ago, they traversed the county promising to prosecute Kingi if re-elected on allegations he has misappropriated county funds. The Jubilee Party leaders will face Raila Odinga (ODM) and Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper) of the National Super Alliance.
