More than 300 Kisumu residents of Kisumu on Monday camped outside IEBC's office demanding to know why their names are not in the voters' register.With just hours to the August 8 vote, they expressed fear they will not be able to choose leaders.Some noted they registered to vote and underwent the verification process.Merceline Anyango, who spoke at the office in Milimani, said she registered at St Paul Primary School.Anyango said they marched there to see their county returning officer for help but found the gates locked. She said there was nobody to assist them."We need to be assisted so we can exercise our democratic right tomorrow," she said, adding many have been affected and need help from the commission.Grace Aluoch, a voter from Kisumu Central constituency, said she had also confirmed her registration status.County Returning Officer John Lorionokou later addressed them, saying their problem may have resulted from double registration."If there are two or three people with shared ID numbers, the names will automatically not appear in the register," Lorionokou said.He referred the group to their constituency offices.
