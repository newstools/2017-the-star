City Hall&rsquo;s Parking department is ready to restructure operations to conform with the policies Governor Mike Sonko.During his campaigns, Sonko said that in his first 100 days he would reduce parking fees from the current Sh300 to Sh140 per day. Speaking at City Hall yesterday, Parking Services director Fredrick Ndunyu said they are awaiting directions.&ldquo;Motorists are advised to pay the stipulated fees [Sh300] until a new directive is issued,&rdquo; he said.The county will clamp and tow vehicles of those who do not pay. &ldquo;A trend is emerging in the city where some motorists fail to pay parking fees, while others collude with parking boys not to pay. But we are on the lookout,&rdquo; Ndunyu said.Early this year, the Parking department was ranked as the best-performing stream by the county Treasury.
