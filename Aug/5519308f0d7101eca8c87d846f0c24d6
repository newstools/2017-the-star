Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya was yesterday sworn into office for a second term and started by putting wheeler-dealers and brokers on notice. He was sworn in by Kitale resident judge Hillary Chemitai at the Bukhungu Stadium. Oparanya said anyone found engaging in underhand dealings will face the full force of the law. He said he will form a Cabinet with people of integrity who will help him actualise his agenda. Oparanya’s administration was accused by the Office of the Auditor General of financial misappropriation. He snubbed several summonses by the Senate to respond to audit queries during his first term. Yesterday, Oparanya said, “I will put together an effective and efficient Cabinet.” Last week, Oparanya said he will sack nonperforming executive committee members. Oparanya extended an olive branch to losers, saying they have a role to play in moving the county forward. Senator-elect Cleophas Malala, MPs-elect Ayub Savula (Lugari), Emmanuel Wangwe (Navakholo), Malulu Injendi (Malava), Tindi Mwale (Butere), Titus Khamala (Lurambi), Justus Kizito (Shinyalu), Christopher Aseka (Khwisero) and Bernard Shinali (Iklomani) were present. “I am going to work with all elected leaders, regardless of their political party affiliation to ensure effective service to the people,” Oparanya said. He said he will work to ensure the struggling Mumias Sugar Company is revived. He said the economy of Western region depends on agriculture and the collapse of the company would have serious effects on the region. Oparanya lauded NASA chief Raila Odinga and his co-principals for using legal means to resolve the presidential election dispute.
