Mombasa Governor  and Coast kingpin Hassan Joho headed for an unassailable election victory, but he couldn’t protect two key ODM allies. Some observers said the Coast political supreme might be losing his grip as Jubilee has made inroads. The Coast overwhelmingly voted for ODM in 2013, but this time round,  it doens’t have a lock on the vote. Yesterday preliminary results gave Joho a landslide victory against challengers Suleiman Shahbal of Jubilee, Hassan Omar of Wiper and VDP’s Hezron Awiti. Joho lead in almost  all 934 polling stations. Mombasa has 580,223 registered voters. By yesterday afternoon, Joho, fondly referred to as the Sultan, had garnered 195,104 votes. Omar — Joho’s bitter critic and the outgoing senator — was trailing by 38,676, behind Shahbal’s 61,231 votes. Awiti — outgoing Nyali MP — had 4,110 votes, followed by little-known Daniel Kitsao of Kadu Asili, who had 1,399. In 2013, emerged victorious with 130,000 votes against Shahbal’s 96,000 votes. Results were trickling in slowly and by 12pm, some polling stations were still taking results to constituency tallying centres. However, Joho may well have been uneasy because some of his allies lost MP seats. In Kisauni, incumbent Rashid Bedzima lost to Wiper’s Ali Mbogo, who was in ODM before he decamped to the Umbrella party. By midday, Bedzimba had garneded 24,219 votes against Mbogo’s 30,546. In Nyali, Joho’s first cousin Saidi Abdhalla ltrailed former KTN reporter Mohamed Ali. Ali ran as an independent after losing in the ODM primaries in April. He was ahead with 24,201 votes against Abdhalla’s 14,790. Abdhalla conceded defeat. Speaking to the Star on the phone, Abdhalla said, “I have already moved on. It was a tight race. We have learnt from our mistakes and we shall put a strong fight in future” “The Nyali people settled on Ali and I respect that.” Ali said, “It was highly expected ofme to win.” He trounced 13 other candidates in the battle for 104,017 votes.
