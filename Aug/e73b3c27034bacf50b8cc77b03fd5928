Only two out of the 35 MCAs in Kisumu were reelected. They are West Kisumu MCA Paul Okiri and his Shauri Moyo-Kaloleni counterpart Prisca Misachi. Nominated MCA Pamela Akinyi was elected in Manyatta B ward. Four other MCAs not running on the ODM ticket survived the Orange Party wave in Kisumu, beating ODM candidates. The other 31 were all won on the ODM ticket. George Oluoch (West Nyakach), John Agengâ€™o (East Kano-Wawidhi) and Benny Oiko (Kabonyo-Kanyagwal) won as independents, while Juma Philemon (Central Nyakach) won on the Ford Kenya ticket. During the ODM party nominations in April, about 26 of the MCAs lost. But some decided to run as independent candidates, claiming they were robbed of victory in the shambolic primaries.
