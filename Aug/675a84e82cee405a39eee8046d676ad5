Nyamira residents will have to wait longer for piped water after they disagreed about the sites of three projects. The water projects were to begin by the end of last year, but this failed. Landowners have been unwilling to make room. The Lake Victoria South Water Services Board is determined to start the mega projects along rivers Gucha and Eyaka. It has, however, faced stiff resistance from families whose land borders the rivers. Landowners in Bonyunyu , where a project is to be set up along River Gucha, have refused to cooperate. The board blames this on political interferance. The residents sent away experts, who were to conduct feasibility studies at a proposed site of the Dutch-funded project. Chairman John Koech said the projects will solve 80 per cent of the regionâ€™s shortage and want residents to cooperate.
