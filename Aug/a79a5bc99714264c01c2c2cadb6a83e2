Embakasi West MP George Theuri is the talk of town for all the wrong reasons after walking to a State House invite wearing flip-flop sandals. President Uhuru Kenyatta had invited the newly elected Jubilee Nairobi leaders to State House and in a picture that sparked online reactions, Theuri is seen posing for a group photo with the President and other legislators with a casual outfit and sandals. The media was quick to put him on the spot, and the MP was quick to respond on his Facebook account, saying the media is fond of poking him. "Please help me understand why this media guys call me a ‘Controversial Mp’ I'm just being myself nothing more. Mimi ni jamaa tuu wa mtaani," he wrote. This got mixed reactions online, with some siding with him, noting it was a weekend and the outfit was appropriate. "At the table of men, you don't show up as a boy," replied Khali Waweru. "Mhesh just tell them kujifanya high class uliwachia shingo ya twiga." This was not his first time in the media, for he was also previously cited as one of the MPs who rarely spoke during parliamentary proceedings. He was denounced by his people from Embakasi West through social media. Popularly known by his slogan "swag master" and a former 'mitumba' trader who rose to an MCA to an MP, Theuri beats his chest as a ‘commoner’. In his social media accounts, he posts pictures of himself in vibandas (kiosks) having a meal, engaging in clean-up of his constituency and many more. He once drove the residents of Umoja Estate in a PSV to the city centre and paid their bus fares. In January, Embakasi West was ranked top seven among the best constituencies nationally.
