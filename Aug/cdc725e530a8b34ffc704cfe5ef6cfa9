Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga’s campaign team is anxious following NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga’s last-minute change of itinerary that struck off his visit to the county to advocate for the six-piece voting system. His skipping the event has elicited mixed reactions among Rasanga and Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo’s supporters. A source in Rasanga’s campaign team told the Star Raila was expected to visit Siaya and Bondo towns on Thursday before proceeding to Kisumu to advocate the six-piece vote suit. Gumbo is perceived to have strong backing in the two towns. Gumbo decamped from ODM during party nominations in which Rasanga was declared the winner. He termed the primaries shambolic. With the no-show, Rasanga’s team went out on the defensive, saying there was no need for Raila to visit because “the political landscape has since tilted to his advantage”. On Thursday, Rasanga’s campaign point man  Jim Achich said by last week, voters in Siaya and Bondo towns had shown signs of supporting Rasanga. He said there was no need to unnecessarily engage Raila in the homestretch. “Indications are that Rasanga is going back to his office,” Achich said, adding that voters follow the six-piece voting system with ‘religious zeal’. Gumbo’s team expressed confidence in winning. It said Raila’s boycott at the last-minute is a clear indication Gumbo’s popularity is undeniable. Maurice Odhiambo, Gumbo’s key campaigner, said Raila has read the mood of the public which is not ready to follow the six-piece voting suit after bungled ODM nominations. He said Rasanga’s tricks will fail.
