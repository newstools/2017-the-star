Cherangany MP-elect Joshua Kutuny (pictured) of Jubilee has urged the NGOs Coordination Board to stop frustrating civil society groups. He yesterday said the crackdown on rights and good governance NGOs will give the government a bad name internationally. Kutuny said NGOs are not a threat to President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto. He said civil society groups employ thousands of Kenyans and contribute to the economy so they should only be told to comply with the law, not closed. “Even if some of the NGOs have been working to undermine the government, they have not been able to stop Uhuru and Ruto from being elected and it’s important they are left to carry out their business,” Kutuny said.
