A clash could be brewing between youths hired by Governor Mike Sonko&rsquo;s charity organisation - Sonko Rescue Team - to clean the city and the county environment workers.The Star has established the county workers feel their jobs are threatened and have been plotting to block the youths from operating in their locations.Two weeks ago, Sonko hired about 1,000 youths to work under the SRT to collect garbage, clear drainages and unpin campaign posters in an exercise dubbed &lsquo;Ng&rsquo;arisha Jiji.&rsquo;Questions have been raised about the place of the SRT youths in the environment sector and whether they draw their wages from City Hall, considering the organisation is an NGO.The county has been relying on its own staff, contracted garbage collectors and community based organisations to do the work.Sonko said the youths are paid by the organisation and were not contracted by the county.Yesterday morning, activities at the busy Mutindwa market in Buruburu on Outer Ring Road were brought to a standstill after the youths clashed with the county workers who clean the area.The youths arrived in lorries, wearing red overalls written &lsquo;Sonko Rescue Team&rsquo;. Cleaner John Momanyi said, &ldquo;Leo ni kama sitakuwa na kazi. Nimefika na nilipata vijana tayari wanasafisha na sielewi mbona.&rdquo; (Today it seems I won&rsquo;t have work because I arrived and found the youths cleaning and I don&rsquo;t understand why).There are also reports the youths have been met with hostility in Dagoretti North, Ruaraka, Makadara and Embakasi West constituencies.In these areas, the Star understands, locals mobilised by their MPs and MCAs have been cleaning the places.Embakasi West MP George Theuri said he and Sonko agreed to have the SRT youths clean the area until MPs and MCAs&rsquo; swearing in. Thereafter, it will be back to normal.
