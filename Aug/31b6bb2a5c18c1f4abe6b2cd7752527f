The tense relations between the majority Luo and minority Kuria community in Migori county over the presidential voting pattern played out in public during a function on Monday. The crowd at Migori County Stadium during the swearing in of Governor Okoth Obado gave a cold reception to Deputy Governor Mwita Mahanga when he rose to address them. Uriri MP-elect Mark Nyamita said the Kuria community went against the spirit of “being brothers and good neighbours because they mainly voted for President Uhuru Kenyatta based on the results released by the IEBC”. He said it was unfortunate that two Kuria MPs-elect of the Jubilee Party — Mathias Robi (Kuria West) and Marwa Kitayama (Kuria East) — chose to skip the county function. “I would love to tell the deputy governor that as our brothers in Kuria you didn’t vote so well. But, because we are neighbours, we will strive to live in peace,” Nyamita told a cheering crowd. “Talk to our Kuria brothers in Parliament to join us and stay with us.” Uhuru got 41,951 votes, 65 per cent of the total, and won in both Kuria East and Kuria West constituencies. Raila got 21,199 votes — 34 per cent. During campaigns, Raila urged the community to vote six-piece for NASA.
