President Uhuru Kenyatta has blamed the Opposition for “consistently
tainting" Jubilee's flagship projects since he assumed office in 2013. He
said NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga has been using propaganda
against key development projects to hoodwink the public into believing
his administration is corrupt and incompetent. "My five-year term has been rough. They spread propaganda that the SGR project was so costly and even moved to court to block the laptop project. "[Former] President Mwai Kibaki's last five-year tenure was wasted just like that because of these individuals," Uhuru said on Friday. He spoke at State House Nairobi during a series of interviews on a number of FM stations including Gukena and Radio Jambo. "They claim we have been borrowing a lot, but they forget we have been doing so to roll out crucial projects that can by everyone. These projects have created jobs for our youths and propelled the economy of this nations," the President said. Uhuru asked voters to re-elect him and dismissed NASA politicians as "individuals yearning for powerful positions". "There is time for jokes. Time has come for us to come out in large numbers and vote," he said. He also rubbished NASA's "10 million strong" slogan, saying it is merely based on tribal inclinations. “If
you sell your vote, you will be selling your future. My people, voting
for Uhuru will not just be in vain, but for peace and prosperity of this
nation,” he said at Gukena FM. Uhuru maintained that his track record is anchored on key foundation projects implanted by retired President Mwai Kibaki. Read: Uhuru nearer to victory than Raila - Infotrak
