Millionaire businessman Bundotich Kiprop, also known as Buzeki, has said he will
implement part of his campaign manifesto, despite losing to Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago. He will start by setting up a milk
plant and projects to create jobs. Buzeki and Mandago met
in Eldoret on Tuesday for the first time after last week's election. The two pledged to promote unity and development. Mandago urged Buzeki to invest in the county. "The season of election is
over and it's now time to join hands and build our county," Mandago said. The two met at the burial of Mzee
Joseph Koros at Kesses. Mandago defeated Buzeki in a tight contest for the county's leadership. Buzeki conceded defeat and offered 300 per cent support for the governor. "He is now the father of the
county and residents of Uasin Gishu look up to him to unite everyone so that we
move forward together," he said. When they met yesterday, Buzeki said he
would strive to implement the pledges he made during the campaigns. "I am urging residents of Uasin
Gishu to support the governor so that he delivers on his mandate," he said. Buzeki said he will be available for
consultation on development. "We can't talk politics forever. It's time to focus on development," he said. Mandago urged NASA to concede defeat.
