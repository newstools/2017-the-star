NASA lawyers have said they have a bombshell and will demonstrate at the Supreme Court the magnitude of fraud committed during elections.Speaking outside the court on Friday, Orengo said most of the 54,000 papers filed by IEBC have no security features&nbsp;as stipulated in their Acts."We have a bombshell...in my many years of practice I have never seen such magnitude of forgery. A &nbsp;majority&nbsp;of&nbsp;IEBC papers are fake," said the Opposition lawyer and Senator of Siaya county. "They do not have security features required. We are justified on why we were worried by the manner elections were carried out." Orengo said&nbsp; their lawyers have filed an interlocutory application and written submissions in support of the petition.&nbsp; In the application, they are seeking scrutiny and audit of the elections materials. The coalition had until 1pm to file the responses. IEBC, chairman Wafula Chebukati and President Uhuru Kenyatta have until 7pm today to file submissions.The electoral agency earlier downplayed the NASA petition disputing the presidential election result saying it was vague. In a response filed by the commission at Supreme Court, IEBC said NASA's petition is&nbsp;based on generalities and misconceptions, and lacks particulars as required by law.The commission filed their response at the court a few minutes after Uhuru's legal team submitted theirs.More on this:&nbsp;NASA petition vague, IEBC says in responseRead: [VIDEO] 'We are not vifaranga vya computer': Uhuru responds to Raila petitionOn Thursday, NASA said it wants Uhuru to stop making utterances suggesting he won the election legitimately as their petition is in the top court's hands.Musalia Mudavadi, who served as national campaign committee chairman, noted Uhuru should await the court's determination.Read: Stop acting as president before Supreme Court ruling, NASA tells UhuruAlso read: Uhuru is still your president, Duale tells NASA on MPs' swearing-in
