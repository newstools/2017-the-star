Voters in Siaya county, Raila Odnga’s backyard, appear likely to have voted six-piece suit. ODM Governor Jack Ransanga and Senator James Orengo are leading with comfortble margins, according to provisional results. In Gem, ODM candidate Elisha Odhiambo has maintained a wide lead from the start and by press time he was ahead with 33,520 votes against Midiwo’s 28,245. ODM’s Christine Ombaka was ahead in the race for woman representative. The counting was still underway with more than 60 per cent of counting done. In Ugenya, ODM candidate Chris Karan was leading with 16,200 against incumbent MP David Ochieng’s 11,600. IEBC officials in Ugenya said the final results would be announced yesterday afternoon as most polling stations had transmitted their results. If Elisha and Karan win,ODM will bag all the six MP seats in the county. Otiende Amollo of Rarieda, Ugunja’s Opiyo Wandayi, Bondo’s Gideon Ochanda and Samuel Atandi of Alego Usonga are headed for landslide wins, according to the provisional results. All contestants were running on the ODM ticket. In the 2013 General Election, candidates in Siaya county won five ODM parliamentary seats in six constituencies. In Alego Usonga, the party lost to Wiper’s Muluan Omondi. In the run-up to Tuesday’s polls, ODM leader and NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga pleaded with residents not to embarrass him by electing independent candidates. He asked voters in his strongholds to embrace the six-piece voting pattern — vote a straight ODM ticket. This strategy seems to have been successful. By press time, only one independent MCA, Obiero Otare from Siaya Township, was leading, according to  the provisional results for Siaya county. Earlier, Senator Orengo asked locals to ensure they paint Siaya county orange by electing all ODM candidates to give Raila strength when he ascends to power.
