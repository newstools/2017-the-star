The Kenya Ports Authority has decried the few available transport options for maize from the coastal city as high demand for the grain persists.Managing director Cathrine Mturi-Wairi said the high demand for transportation of the grain has seen the number of trucks available to ferry the grain upcountry go down.She said the number of trucks contracted by the millers through their respective clearing agents has reduced from the ideal 2500 trucks in 24 hours to approximately 700 trucks.&ldquo;The government prioritized the handling and transportation of maize due to the shortage caused by erratic weather patterns and food inflationary pressures which prompted massive importation of the commodity,&rdquo; Mturi said.She explained that the prevailing situation and arrangement caused low availability of trucks especially for handling wheat.Mturi however stated they are addressing the logistics of handling grains at the port with inter-agencies committee comprising KPA, KRA, KEBS, KEPHIS and security teams.&ldquo;The current situation is an abnormal influx experienced as all millers are importing grains en masse following the waiver of duty on the commodity. Ultimately, we shall experience a heavy reduction of importation once the situation normalizes,&rdquo; she said in a statement.In June, the agriculture CS Willy Bett said the government will use the SGR to ensure maize is delivered on time to ease shortage of flour and congestion at the Port of Mombasa.He said using the road alone as the only means of transport was posing as a challenge due to the high uptake of the grain by millers.In the same month, millers had also blamed the shortage of wheat flour in the country to congestion of vessels at the Port of Mombasa. The millers said they were losing a lot of money as they could not supply commodities to consumers on time.&ldquo;There are many ships lining up at the port waiting to be offloaded, and priority is being given to white maize to ease the shortage of flour. We have white maize, yellow maize and wheat at the port, hence the delay for millers to get the commodities in a timely manner,&rdquo; a miller said.According to the ministry of agriculture, there are two ships carrying 400,000 bags and another 40,000 metric tonnes which are currently being off loaded at the port. Three more ships carrying imported maize are waiting to dock. So far, 5,084,283 million bags of maize have been imported from various countries.
