NASA is piling pressure on the IEBC to share the constituency Forms 34B on presidential results as Thirdway Alliance leader Ekuru Aukot said his audit of the results revealed anomalies. The NASA presidential campaign team, headed by ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi, yesterday in a statement said the IEBC, chaired by Wafula Chebukati, has “failed and refused” to share the forms from returning officers in 291 constituencies to eight presidential candidates and their agents. “We call upon the commission to release and share all the constituency Forms 34B to party agents. The failure can only lead to a conclusion that the forms do not exist and the commission is busy generating fake forms to justify its declaration of results made on August 11,” read the statement. NASA said its chief agents have been requesting Chebukati to provide the forms since Saturday, without success. “The said forms cannot be traced or accessed on the commission’s online portal,” it said. The IEBC, however, assured NASA it is ready to provide the forms “immediately.” “We are, however, not able to supply Forms 34A at the moment, but the same shall be availed to you as soon as possible,” reads a statement from the IEBC. The IEBC has published part of Forms 34A of 40,883 polling stations on presidential results announced on Friday night when President Uhuru Kenyatta was declared the winner. He garnered 8,218,043 votes against NASA candidate Raila Odinga’s  6,817,245. Raila has rejected the results, terming them a “fraud” and refused to concede defeat, despite the international community and election observers mounting pressure on him.
