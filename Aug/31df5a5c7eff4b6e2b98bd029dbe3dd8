The government has stopped salary negotiations with striking nurses until they resume work.The Council of Governors and the Ministry of Health said they have to carry out a job re-evaluation, which the Salaries and Remuneration Commission requires to grade nurses.The new grading would guide the development of a better collective bargaining agreement for nurses.Currently, nurses are ranked as low-skilled together with non-core staff like office cleaners and messengers.Yesterday, President Uhuru Kenyatta also urged them to get back to work to allow the new governors to settle into office.&ldquo;The public should not suffer. Kindly resume work and let the governors settle for a few weeks and then let&rsquo;s talk and agree,&rdquo; he said at Kenyatta National Hospital.He thanked KNH nurses because they did not strike.&ldquo;That has saved the lives of many Kenyans. Even if there are problems, let&rsquo;s talk and resolve them,&rdquo; he said.Earlier, SRC had advised nurses to avail themselves for re-evaluation if they want higher salaries.CoG chief executive Jacqueline Mogeni said they are ready for the exercise once the nurses resume work.&ldquo;The purpose of this letter is, therefore, to request nurses to go back to work and offer services to pave the way for the job description review to start immediately without delay,&rdquo; she advised nurses&rsquo; union secretary general Seth Panyako in a letter.Once nurses resume work, the SRC and CoG are expected to select a sample to gauge their skills and responsibilities.Nurses have been on strike since June, demanding higher salaries and a registration of their draft collective bargaining agreement.Recently, the ministry and the CoG reevaluated clinical officers, who had protested their &lsquo;low-skilled&rsquo; ranking.The ministry wants diploma clinical officers to start at job group &lsquo;K&rsquo; and degree holders at &lsquo;M&rsquo;. It also said SRC must move clinicians from band &lsquo;B&rsquo; (discretionary-low, skilled-non-professionals) to band &lsquo;C&rsquo; (skilled-professional-specialist).
