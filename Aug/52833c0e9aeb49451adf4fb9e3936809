William Webster has been appointed as Kenya Sevens assistant coach. Webster was an analyst during the 2016-2017 season under coach Innocent Simiyu and will now step up to the role of assistant for the upcoming season. Simiyu worked out without an assistant last season as Shujaa struggled for form and consistency, finishing 12th with 63 points. Kenya only qualified twice for the Main Cup quarter-finals in Cape Town and Singapore with the rest of the season being played in the lower tier Bowl and Shield categories. In other appointments, Geoffrey Kimani has been re-appointed as the strength and conditioning coach. Kimani worked under Benjamin Ayimba in two spells during the 2008/2009 and 2015/2016 season, where Kenya bagged their maiden world series trophy beating Fiji in the final 30-7 in Singapore. Kimani’s most recent assignment was with Uganda, where he handled the Rugby Sevens Cranes in the same capacity at the World Series qualifiers in Hong Kong in April this year. He is also a sprints coach having been part of the Team Kenya to the World athletics Championships in Beijing in 2015. The technical bench have their work cut out with the World Sevens Series which starts in December in Dubai alongside the Commonwealth Games in Perth, Australia next year and the World Cup Sevens in San Francisco, California in June. The team is expected to start training tomorrow. KRU director in charge of national squads, Ian Mugambi, said the squad will consist of 12 players before more players are added from the national sevens circuit which starts next month. “We may add more numbers to the squad as we go along and pick the best players from the national Sevens as per the wishes of the coach,” he added.
