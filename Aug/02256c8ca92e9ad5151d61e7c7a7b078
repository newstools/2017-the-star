Bad blood between the board of directors and senior managers at the Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company is to blame for the firm&rsquo;s troubles.The board says people from &ldquo;within&rdquo; are fighting its efforts to reform the state corporation.&ldquo;Nairobi Water is suffering from in-depth malfeasance. We have been trying to clean the organisation but the cartels are fighting back,&rdquo; Raphael Nzomo, the chairman, said.The firm has faced serious challenges over two months, including a strike, which has hampered services.The workers called off their five-day strike on Tuesday after Governor Mike Sonko suspended the board. They were protesting the board&rsquo;s decision to fire managing director Philip Gichuki.&ldquo;I have suspended the board because the workers have complained of harassment. We want to listen to both sides before we come up with the way forward,&rdquo; Sonko said.Last month, employees boycotted work, saying the board was planning to sell the firm to a French company.A source at the company told the Star, however, that long-serving staff and senior managers have been resisting transfers. They are also opposed to reforms and have roped in the workers&rsquo; union to sabotage the board, the source said. &ldquo;Senior and long-serving staff are the ones who decide the areas that get water. They are raking in millions of shillings,&rdquo; the source said.Nzomo said the board has not received the suspension letter from the governor.He denied the board has been harassing employees.&ldquo;The board does not deal with the employees directly. Neither do we deal with managers. We only deal with the MD,&rdquo; he said.Last Thursday, the board sent Gichuki on terminal leave, saying he had served his full term.
