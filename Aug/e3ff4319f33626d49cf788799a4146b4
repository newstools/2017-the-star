Angolans have voted in a parliamentary election marking the end of nearly four decades in power for President José Eduardo Dos Santos. Dos Santos is not contesting the poll, but his party the MPLA is expected to be victorious when the results are announced later this week. The presidency would then pass to former Defence Minister João Lourenço. His main challenger is Isias Samakuva, from the MPLA's rival in the 27-year civil war, Unita. However, Dos Santos, whose 38-year reign makes him the world's second-longest serving president, will remain in control of the ruling MPLA party. Under Angola's voting system, people are choosing both the candidate and party in the same election. Analysts says the MPLA, which has been in power since independence from Portugal in 1975, is likely to win. However, the election is taking place in a country where, according to Amnesty International, citizens "have lived in a climate of fear in which speaking out was met with intimidation (and) imprisonment". In the previous election, the Casa-CE alliance gained the third most seats. It is led by Abel Chivukuvuku, who split from Unita. The opposition Unita party won 18% of the vote in the last elections. Analysts will be watching closely to see whether the opposition is able to increase its share of the vote this time around. Opposition alliance Casa-CE says up to 20 of its election observers were arrested last night in Luanda for protesting. They were demanding their accreditation to observe the voting, which they had not been given. Protest was banned by the government during campaigning, but the last day of campaigning was Monday. It is not clear if they are still in custody or the exact nature of their charges.
