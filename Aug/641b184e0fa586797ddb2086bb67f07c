Voters in Tana River county sent home more than half of their elected leaders in the General Election. Governor Hussein Dado, Senator Ali Bule and woman rep Halima Ware — all running on the Jubilee ticket — lost. The only MP who was reelected is Bura’s Ali Wario. Galole MP Hassan Dukicha and Garsen MP Ibrahim Sane were sent home. Governor-elect Dhadho Godhana (pictured) won on the ODM ticket. ODM did not win any other seat. During the election, seven out of the 15 MCAs in the county were also sent home. Unlike in the 2013 General Election where the pastoralists won nearly all the seats,this time the farming communities took charge of the county government. This can be attributed to the fall-out between the Wardei and the Orma, both pastoralist communities, whose alliance broke down during power struggles.
