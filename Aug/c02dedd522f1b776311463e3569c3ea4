Reigning Birell Prague Grand Prix 10km champion Violah Jepchumba will be seeking to retain her title in a new world record time next month.Last year, Jepchumba clocked 30:24 to miss the world 10km record by three seconds before world half marathon record holder Joyciline Jepkosgei eclipsed it last April en route to setting the world mark in the 21km race in the same city.Jepkosgei timed 30:05 for the record in 10km at the Prague Half Marathon this year, a race in which Jepchumba was the defending champion.The duo will battle for the top honours again on September 9.Jepchumba, who comes from Nandi County will not be leaving anything to chance in her quest to set a new world record.&ldquo;This time I have trained well and I am in good shape for a better performance. Early this year, I picked an injury while heading for the Prague Half Marathon where I had planned to set a world record,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;With the good shape I am enjoying at the moment, I not only plan to defend my title but to also run a world record.&rdquo;The 30:24 mark she clocked in Prague became the African record over the distance erasing the 30:27 mark set by compatriot Isabella Ochichi in 2005 before Jepkosgei lowered it to 30:05.&ldquo;I understand the course there and hope to employ my skills for improved time performance and perhaps the world record,&rdquo; she said.The Cardiff half marathon winner clocked 65:51 world lead at the Prague Half marathon last year She then extended her winning streak to Istanbul half marathon after winning the Discovery Kenya cross country in Eldoret.
