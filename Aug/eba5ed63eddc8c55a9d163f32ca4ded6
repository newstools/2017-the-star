Despite investing heavily in Mombasa county, Jubilee failed to clinch a single elective post. The county remained in NASA’s tight grip. The governor, senator, women representative and four MPs are all from ODM. One of the other two MPs is an independent and the other from Wiper. The county has six MPs. Mombasa has 30 MCA positions and at least 580,000 registered voters. President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto pulled out all the stops to ensure Jubilee got at least two or more posts. Before the election political analysts said Jubilee would rake in many Mombasa seats, despite the county voting overwhelmingly for ODM in 2013. Uhuru visited Mombasa, and the Coast at large, five times between January and the election to drum up support for his party and candidates.  money down the drain Jubilee pumped millions of shillings into its candidates’ campaigns. At one time, Ruto is said to have given all the 30 Jubilee MCA candidates Sh100,000 each. The six MP candidates each got Sh500,000, and the governor candidate and his running mate Sh1.5 million each. However, last week as the county election results were trickling in, it became apparent that Jubilee had failed to secure a single seat. All that campaign money went down the drain. Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho, who is ODM deputy party leader and a bitter critic of the Uhuru administration, floored Jubilee candidate Suleiman Shahbal by at least 160,000 votes. Joho got 221,177 votes, followed by Shahbal with 69,515 and Hassan Omar of Wiper ( 43,787 ). Hezron Awiti of VDP was fourth with 4,709 votes and Daniel Kitsao of Kadu Asili came in last with just 1,670. ODM veteran lawyer Mohammed Faki floored Jubilee’s Hazel Katana by more than 95,000 votes to become senator. He garnered 171,748 votes against Katana’s 76,144. Katana was Mombasa deputy governor before she decamped to Jubilee. In the woman representative contest, Asha Hussein of ODM defeated nine candidates by winning 186,144 votes. Jubilee’s Amina Abdhalla got 87,384. ODM won the Likoni, Jomvu, Changamwe and Mvita MP seats. The Kisauni and Nyali seats were won by Wiper and an independent, Mohamed Ali. The ex-journalist won Nyali MP. Mishi Mboko won the Likoni seat against Jubilee’s Masoud Mwahima, who served for 10 years. Badi Twalib retained his seat against main challenger Karisa Nzai of Jubilee. In Mvita, Abdulswamad Nassir beat Jubilee’s Omar Shallo, while Omar Mwinyi retained his Changamwe seat. ODM won 27 MCA seats out of 30. The other three went to Wiper, Ford Kenya and to an independent.
