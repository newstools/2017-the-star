NASA principal Moses Wetang’ula, the Ford Kenya leader, has pledged to work with Governor-elect Wycliffe Wangamati, also of Ford Kenya. Cooperation between two prominent Ford Kenya leaders might seem obvious, however, insiders say there has been some tension beneath the surface. Senator Wetang’ula is said to want influence in government and appointments for his Ford Kenya supporters. Wangamati is said to be resistant. No public disagreement has surfaced, however. Wangamati promised to have an all-inclusive government and utilise funds prudently. Wetang’ula did did not campaign much for himself, instead campaigning for NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga. His Ford Kenya brigade campaigned for him. It was led by county chairman and Kanduyi MP Wafula Wamunyinyi and secretary general David Eseli. Wetang’ula defeated his main rival Juma Mukhwana of Jubilee by more than 70,000 votes. Speaking after receiving his election certificate, Wetang’ula thanked voters for their confidence in Ford Kenya. “We will exorcise the ghosts of graft, nepotism, tribalism and embezzlement of public funds in Bungoma,” he said at Kenya Industrial Estates offices, the main tallying centre. The Ford Kenya boss said Bungoma has a rich history and the new team will restore its lost glory. He also thanked voters for electing Catherine Wambilianga the new woman representative. She defeatedJubilee incumbent Reginalda Wanyonyi by a landslide. Wetang’ula said much work needs to be done to restore Bungoma’s image. He criticised outgoing Governor Kenneth Lusaka for doing little to fight corruption. ‘We as a Ford Kenya government will deliver to the people frustrated by the Lusaka regime,” he said. Ford Kenya retained the Kabuchai seat, which was won by James Lusweti. It lost the Kimilili MP seat to Didmas Baraza, who beat Suleiman Murunga. People  celebrated in the streets.
