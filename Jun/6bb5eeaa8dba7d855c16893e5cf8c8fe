This brilliant 1996 debut novel by Alex Garland was adapted into a Hollywood film starring a 25-year-old Leonardo Di Caprio and directed by Danny Boyle, instantly solidifying its status as a cult classic. Definitely watch the film, although you will quickly realise that major plot lines are quite different from the book.Arriving in the exciting city of Bangkok at its peak, a young, adventurous Englishman named Richard is given a hand-drawn map by a seemingly insane fellow Brit called Daffy Duck, to what is seemingly a secret, unspoilt, off-grid Edenic paradise where, according to an urban myth, a group of international wanderers live in utopian bliss. Living in an era of young travellers who shun (and yet can&rsquo;t seem to escape) pre-packaged mass tourism, his curiosity is certainly piqued.Together with his new friends, a French couple named Francoise and Etienne, Richard sets off in search of this mythical island. However, he makes a copy of the map and slips it under the door of two Harvard students they get acquainted with, an unforeseen mistake that later bodes horrific consequences for everyone involved.Upon finding the island, it is at first exactly what they hoped it would be, characterised by lagoons, pristine white sands, clear blue waters, a waterfall, coral gardens and a forest. There, they find a group of nomadic souls, some, like group leader Sal, having dwelt there for over 10 years. It is, however, not all fun and games, and Richard soon discovers that even paradise comes with its own nightmares, and it is more extraordinary and frightening beyond his wildest dreams.FUN FACTWhile the island in the book was meant to be a secret unravelled only by a select few, Maya Bay on Koh Phi Phi Leh in Thailand&rsquo;s East Coast, where the film was shot, has now become a crowded tourist hotspot, so if you prefer privacy and seclusion, this is probably not the place for you.
