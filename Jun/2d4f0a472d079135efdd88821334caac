Millers have blamed the congestion of vessels at the Port of Mombasa on the wheat shortage being experienced in the country.They said there are so many ships lining up at the port waiting to be offloaded, and priority is being given to white maize to ease the shortage of flour.&ldquo;We have white maize, yellow maize and wheat at the port, hence the delay for millers to get the commodities in a timely manner,&rdquo; a miller said. Agriculture PS Richard Lesiyampe yesterday said harvesting of wheat in Narok will begin in the next few weeks.&ldquo;We are waiting to see how much will be harvested by July, then we can determine if we need to import more wheat. But before importing, we will first buy what our farmers have,&rdquo; he said.The PS said so far the country has imported less than 1.2 million bags, and traditionally Kenya imports 60 per cent of wheat mainly from Ukraine. According to 2017 Economic Survey, wheat production reduced by 6.8 per cent to 222,400 in 2016 from 238,600 tonnes in 2012. Wheat imports decreased by 4.2 per cent to 1,362,300 tonnes in 2016 from 1,421,800 in 2015. Tuskys chief executive Dan Githua said the supply of wheat flour in their outlets has not been sufficient in the last two weeks. Githua said they have only been receiving a third of their daily supply from the manufacturers.&ldquo;This is a bad situation for our consumers when there is no sufficient maize and wheat flour on the shelves,&rdquo; Githua said.
