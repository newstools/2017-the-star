Jubilee Party will launch its reelection manifesto today in Nairobi. The ruling party&rsquo;s opponents will launch their election manifesto on Thursday next week.Jubilee, who have a four-and-a-half year track record, should ensure that their manifesto launch goes far beyond being just the fashionable thing to do and that they work flat out, in the event of reelection, to deliver on a minimum 50 per cent of their pledges.And this is required also of NASA, in the event that they are the victors on August 8.The JP reelection manifesto will be keenly scrutinized and compared and contrasted with their track record of since April 2013 often by both friend and foe and nondescript.A serious manifesto is not tabled for the sake of it. It is a roadmap with reasonable deliverables and in preparation for the third one in 2022, if things work out.And whether things work out is entirely dependent on how hard Jubilee works to deliver on its pledges in-between elections.
