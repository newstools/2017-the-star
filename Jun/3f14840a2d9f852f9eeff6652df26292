Millicent Boina took a plunge into the world of politics in 2013 after her stint on the Big Brother house. She is the current MCA for Ziwani and come August, she will be defending the seat.In April, she lost four members of her campaign in a road accident. Millicent and four members of her campaign team had completed their campaigns in Gilgil when the crash occurred. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d call it selfishness on the part of the car in front of us. My driver was trying to overtake and the motorist in front of us would not allow us to do so, even though he could see a truck coming.&rdquo;Millicent is the only one who survived the accident. She was in ICU for four weeks and had surgery on her knee and arm. Metal plates were inserted. &ldquo;When I woke up and asked where my friends were, I was told they have all been buried. I am emotionally drained right now, and being on bed rest, my campaigns have been reduced to phone campaigns. The rest of my team are trying to garner support for me on the ground. I even received my Jubilee certificate in hospital. I have cried a lot. The whole accident was like a horror movie.&rdquo;Millicent says her rivals have used the accident to campaign against her. &ldquo;They have called me a witch, saying that I am part of a cult and sacrificed my team as part of a ritual to win the nomination. It is very frustrating. The problem with frustrating women is that frustrated women then give birth to frustrated children and the cycle continues.&rdquo;
