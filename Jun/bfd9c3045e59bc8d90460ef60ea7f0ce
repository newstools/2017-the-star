NASA has dismissed Jubilee's manifesto as a hoax and list of unfulfilled promises, warning Kenyans will use the scorecard to vote on August 8.The Opposition alliance challenged the ruling coalition to promote its achievements so the people can evaluate performance.&ldquo;When there is a government, everyone knows its re-election will be determined by its record while in power,&rdquo; Kisumu Senator Anyang' Nyong&rsquo;o said in a press statement issued on behalf of the NASA team.The five principals are Raila Odinga (ODM, presidential candidate), Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper, DP candidate), Moses Wetang'ula (Ford Kenya, Bungoma Senator), Musalia Mudavadi (ANC) and Isaac Rutto (Bomet Governor, CCM).Nyong'o, who is Kisumu governor aspirant, said Jubilee has failed to explain how it will tackle corruption and the spiraling debt which have denied Kenyans good service."All the promises in their new manifesto end up highlighting what they failed to deliver," he said.He added that polls clearly show 70 per cent members of the public believe the country is headed in the wrong direction.&ldquo;It is a clear indication that many Jubilee supporters are also deeply aggrieved by the grotesque plunder of our resources," said Nyong'o.&ldquo;I know that even die-hard Jubilee supporters are deeply aggrieved by the Jubilee record, ravaged as even they have been [also been affected by corruption]."In July last year, a poll by research firm Ipsos showed 60 per cent of Kenyans believed the country was moving in the wrong direction.The number had reduced compared to the previous year in November when 67 per cent of Kenyans reported that they believed the country was not on the right path of growth.In May, a poll indicated Raila had sharply narrowed the gap with the President, at 47 and 42 per cent support respectively.More on this: Kenya headed in wrong direction, 60% say in latest Ipsos surveyAlso read: Uhuru, Raila in tight race, Ipsos opinion poll showsNyong'o further said Jubilee&rsquo;s many "disastrous policies centre on exclusion".&ldquo;What is astonishing is that Jubilee continued with the policy after the election as if President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto were unaware there would be electoral reckoning in five years."NASA also said Jubilee&rsquo;s leadership has been characterised by tribalism, theft, bad governance and disregard of the constitution due to bad policies.The Senator noted this has caused death and impoverished Kenyans.&ldquo;Kenyans know their major afflictions are not due to acts of nature,&rdquo; he said, adding Jubilee&rsquo;s mismanagement of the economy has increased the cost of living.He said this was also to blame for the steep inflation, joblessness among youths, ethnic clashes, urban crime, grabbing and retrenchment in all sectors of the economy.Nyong'o said due to public theft, Rwanda, Uganda and Tanzania have pulled out of energy and infrastructure projects they have previously committed to."Regionally, Kenya was once the envy of all our neighbours. But Ethiopia overtook us last month as the region&rsquo;s top economy. Tanzania, once so far behind us, is poised to overtake us is economic output any day now."
