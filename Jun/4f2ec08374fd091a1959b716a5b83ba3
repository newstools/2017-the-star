Older HIV positive commercial sex workers in Nairobi are more likely to suffer obesity-related diseases, a study has found.The research found that although patients taking ARVs live longer, they are at risk of age-related complications.The study, led by Moses Masika of University of Nairobi and Joshua Kimani from the Sex Workers Outreach Programme (SWOP), was published in the latest edition of the East African Medical Journal.SWOP is an agency working with sex workers to promote their health and safety, and affirm their occupational rights. The programme which has been in existence since 2008 is in effect in nine areas of Nairobi.The research, which aimed to determine the prevalence of hypertension and obesity among HIV positive people enrolled in SWOP, involved 3,197 subjects interviewed between 2011 and 2014.Most of the participants fell in the 30 to 49 age group while 266 women and 201 men were more than 50 years of age.A majority of them only had primary school education and male sex workers earned an average of Sh10,000 a month while women earned an average of Sh7,000.The research found that a third of the participants were either obese or overweight, with over half of them having a high waist to hip ratio.It also found women were more likely to be obese while men were more likely to suffer hypertension.&ldquo;Hypertension and obesity are important co-morbidities among HIV patients,&rdquo; the researchers said."Preventative and management strategies should be adopted as part of the comprehensive package on offer at all existing HIV care and Anti-Retroviral Therapy centres targeting those enrolled for services as well as their relatives and the community at large.&rdquo;
