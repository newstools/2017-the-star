They said some politicians have taken advantage of the current shortage to import sugar to finance their campaigns.They said Sunday night&rsquo;s murder of a senior manager of the troubled Mumias Sugar Company occurred a day after NASA co-principal Musalia Mudavadi made critical revelations about the firm in Kakamega.Mumias Sugar legal officer Ronald Lubya was shot by gunmen in his Matungulu home. He was with his wife when the gunmen attacked at 10.30pm.Speaking to the media at Parliament Buildings yesterday in the company of Alfred Agoi (Sabatia) and Yusuf Chanzu (Vihiga), Lugari MP Ayub Savula said the murder could have been planned by some politicians.Yesterday, police investigating the killing ruled out robbery.Police recovered a Toyota Harrier, which the three attackers stole from the family in Lukusi village. The vehicle was recovered at Kabula market on the Mumias-Bungoma road, where the attackers had abandoned it.Police believe that assailants could have taken the vehicle to make it look like a robbery.Western region police commander Moses Ombati said, &ldquo;We neither have nor established the motive of the killing, because there was no commotion at the scene, suggesting the deceased was the target.&rdquo; &ldquo;If these were robbers, they would have crossed over to Uganda, because the location of the scene is close to the border.&rdquo;Sources told the Star Lubya had reported to the company security that his life was in danger. He said police were interrogating some people, but denied they had been arrested.Lubya returned from Nairobi on Sunday, where he attended a board meeting. &ldquo;I picked him from Kisumu and we went to Bungoma before returning home,&rdquo; his wife Josephine Shikonyi said.The three thugs, who wore masks and jungle fatigues, cut Lubya&rsquo;s fence.They shot him twice in the head and neck, tied his hands and dragged him into the house, where they demanded documents and money.On Saturday, Mudavadi said some top Jubilee officials attempted to coerce outgoing Mumias Sugar managing director Errol Johnson to make a Sh10 million payout towards JP&rsquo;s campaigns. He said the money was to come from the Sh369 million Sugar Development Levy meant to pay farmers. &ldquo;We are aware that Johnson has written an email stating that he cannot afford to work in such an environment,&rdquo; Mudavadi said in Bukhungu Stadium.The company has been closed for what the management says is routine maintenance.
