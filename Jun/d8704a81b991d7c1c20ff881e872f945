Former national and East Africa volleyball champions Kwanthanze Girls will be out to re-establish themselves as they return to the national scene of the Kenya Secondary Schools Sports Association (KSSSA) Term 2B Games between July 3 and 8 in Nyeri.Last year, the Machakos-based team was locked out of the national championships for the first time in six years by Kibera side Soweto Academy at the former Metropolitan region qualification. Soweto went on to finish second to AIC Kosirai both at the nationals and East Africa Games.After the beating, things did not seem to work in their favour as four of their starting six graduated from the school. Head coach Justine Kigwari has thus had a huge task to build a new squad for this season. This year, the Kwanthanze outfit features seven Form one students who are yet to fit in the shoes of title-winning lineup the school had. Among the players Kwanthanze lost at the end of last year are Kenya Prisons&rsquo; duo of Teresa Ekai Ewet and Pamela Masai, and Kenya Volleyball league side Mt. Kenya University pair of Lucy Mumo and Winnie Nyamai.Kigwari has had to contend with the form-one students, who were drawn from top primary schools like St. Augustine from Nandi County.
