Sick doctors have posted on social media laboratory results showing they tested positive for cholera, possibly contracted at the upscale Weston Hotel where they were attending a conference. There were no definitive figures on how many people were ill and what was the diagnosis. Initial reports indicated as many as 47 people were hospitalised. Cholera infections can be fatal. It is typically transmitted by food and water usually contaminated by faeces. Symptoms are diarrhoea, vomiting and cramps. The Star saw positive lab results of a pregnant doctor admitted at Nairobi Hospital. She was angry the Health ministry was denying an outbreak.&ldquo;The rapid diagnostic test, which is more sensitive, shows I have cholera. Several other doctors have also received positive results. I am pregnant so I&rsquo;m in an isolation ward. Who will pay all these bills? Weston Hotel should just own up,&rdquo; said the medic, who cannot be named because she works for the government. The Ministry of Health strenuously denied anyone had contracted cholera.Director of Medical Services Dr Jackson Kioko said 24 rapid diagnostic tests returned negative results for cholera. &ldquo;We collected samples from all those feeling bad yesterday (Thursday). The whole night we prepared samples and tests for febrile cholera that turned out negative. Now we need confirmatory tests as those were rapid diagnostics.&rdquo;Health CS Cleopa Mailu said there will be further testing. &ldquo;Signs and symptoms do not meet classical definition of cholera,&rdquo; he said. Some 400-500 people attended the conference on respiratory health.
