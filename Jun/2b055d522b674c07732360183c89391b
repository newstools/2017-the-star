Two Cabinet Secretaries have accused the opposition of plotting chaos during the August election.Devolution CS Mwangi Kiunjuri and Transport&rsquo;s James Macharia said the opposition&rsquo;s &lsquo;10 million-strong&rsquo; slogan is meant to incite Kenyans against each other.The two spoke on Tuesday at Kambiti in Maragua, Murang&rsquo;a county, where they distributed relief food.&ldquo;This 10 million-strong thing they are propagating is a plan to take Kenyans back to The Hague, but I want to tell them that they will be the ones who will be taken there,&rdquo; Kiunjuri said.They said NASA leaders know they will lose to Jubilee Party and are preparing Kenyans for chaos.icc revisitedKiunjuri said the Jubilee government has only worked for two years. He said the President and Deputy President spent the first two years of their first term fighting the ICC cases against them.President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto were charged with crimes against humanity over the 2007-08 post-election violence.Some 1,200 people were killed and 600,000 displaced. Kiunjuri said Kenyans are not ready for a repeat of the violence. &ldquo;They insist they will get 10 million votes when they know it is clearly impossible,&rdquo; he said. Macharia urged Kenyans to consider the projects the government has initiated &ldquo;in the two years it has been fully operational&rdquo;.He said the development record established may be reversed if Uhuru and Ruto are not reelected. Macharia urged Kenyans not to gamble with the country&rsquo;s future.&ldquo;We have to tell it as it is because the opposition is just spreading propaganda. If the government has been able to achieve as much as it has in just two years, imagine what it can do in five?&rdquo;
