Ongoing radical changes in the Education sector could also see the creation of a third category of schools, apart from private and public institutions, if MPs pass a new Bill introduced in the House yesterday.The Basic Education (Amendment) Bill, 2017, sponsored by Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa (pictured), seeks to compel the government to set up another group of learning institution called the Public-Private Partnership schools to help improve the quality of education.&ldquo;The proposed amendment is intended to improve the quality of education service delivery in Kenya since Public-Private Partnership sponsored schools bring together the reach of the government system with the innovation of the private sector,&rdquo; the Bill states.Wamalwa bars any move to convert the proposed category of schools to private basic education institutions or to any other private status without consulting the National Education Board or the Education CS.&ldquo;The CS may make regulations to provide for integration of the madrassa, Duksi and pastoral programmes of instructions into the formal education system as appropriate to improve access and retention,&rdquo; the Bill says.Wamalwa argues that the new schools will enable children from poor families to access quality education offered in private institutions for learners from well-off families.&ldquo;The effective running of the new category of schools will depend on the agreement between the government and the private sector,&rdquo; he said.The MP added that government, through the Teachers Service Commission, can sign an agreement with private institutions for their tutors to teach in the schools and that daily operations be left to private individuals.
