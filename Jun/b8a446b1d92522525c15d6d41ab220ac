Parallel tallying centres to be set up by Jubilee and NASA teams should not be a problem if they are all honest, the Muslim community has said.The Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims yesterday supported the planned parallel tallying centres by the two major political outfits.President Uhuru Kenyatta has made a turnabout from his earlier stance against NASA&rsquo;s proposal to carry out its own tallying.However, Supkem national chairman Abdulghafour Al-Busaidy said honesty is key when relaying results to prevent violence.&ldquo;If I vote and you record, another person records and another records, the result cannot be different. The vote remains the same. I don&rsquo;t see any problem so long as it is honest. There should be no lying,&rdquo; he said.Al-Busaidy addressed the press at the Mbaruk Mosque in Mombasa.He was accompanied by Supkem&rsquo;s Coast regional coordinator Sheikh Muhdhar Khitamy and other members.In a veiled statement, they supported claims that Muslims have got a raw deal under the Uhuru administration.On Monday, Kenya Muslims National Advisory Council chairman Sheikh Juma Ngao said Muslims will support NASA because they have been let down by Jubilee, despite their 2013 support.Al-Busaidy said the more than 10-million Muslim community in Kenya has not got what it deserves under Jubilee.&ldquo;To be honest, we, Muslims, feel we should get more than we are getting,&rdquo; he said.He was, however, quick to add that Muslims will get what they deserve through their own sustained efforts.&ldquo;It is our duty to work harder in everything so we are not looked down upon or oppressed. It is our responsibility as a community to make sure we do not get any raw deal,&rdquo; Al-Busaidy said.He urged the community to speak in one voice so that it is respected and its problems fixed.&ldquo;The main thing is for us to work together for the benefit of the Muslim community and the benefit of the country,&rdquo; Al-Busaidy said.The council told the government to respect all candidates and treat them equally and warned against use of state resources to campaign, saying it will undermine the need for a fair contest.The clerics added that any mischief could ruin the country like it almost did after the 2007 election.&ldquo;For the presidential race, the two main political formations have already demonstrated their intentions to pull out all stops to emerge victorious,&rdquo; Al-Busaidy said.He urged politicians to preach peace, adding that rivalry in the counties has got them worried as candidates campaign for the coveted governor seats.
