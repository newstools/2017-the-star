Popular Kikuyu musician Kamande Wa Kioi is in Nairobi West hospital where he is receiving treatment after falling into a coma.It is not clear what ails him but a fellow artiste Jeff Kuria who visited Kamande in hospital went live.The star popular for his singles Karanga Chapo, Kapusi Gakwa and Teacher Teacher complained of dizziness and fatigue before he was rushed to Kenol Hospital in Murang'a.He was admitted there for six days before he was transferred to Nairobi West. He says his recovery from the coma was akin to a "resurrection".I must be the fourth person in the history of the world and in kenya i'm the first, " Kamande said from his hospital bed."I had pipes inserted down my throat, I could feel them in my stomach. They were placed there to enable me to breath. I would have died at Kenol Hospital. I'm lucky to be alive," he said, "I prayed to God to take this health issue away from me. He resurrected me, added.The guitar wiz reassured his fans that he is now stable and his vitals are okay."No prayers made on my behalf were wasted or lost, they all went straight [to God and were answered]." Kamande said.
