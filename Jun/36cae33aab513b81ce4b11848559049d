Three people will be charged with the mutilation murders of Eldoret MCA aspirant James Ratemo&rsquo;s three children, Uasin Gishu CID boss Patrick Kiswii has said.Two of the three suspects, including the children&rsquo;s uncle Enoch Onsase, are in custody in Eldoret.Five special investigation officers from Nairobi are tracking the third suspect, who is on the run.&ldquo;We have made very good progress and we will take those we suspect to court,&rdquo; Kiswii said. &ldquo;We are looking for one more suspect who is still in hiding but we will get him soon.&rdquo;The motive has not been disclosed. There is speculation about political or business rivalry, a family dispute or land feud.The sleuths used Onsase&rsquo;s mobile phone and witnesses to identify those suspected of strangling Clifford Nyamweya, six, five-year-old Dan Nyamweya and Glen Ongaki, three. Their eyes were gouged out and fingers cut off. The bodies were retrieved from the River Nzoia on May 18. A postmortem indicated strangulation.They will be buried on June 9 in Nyacheke village, Kisii. A memorial service will be held on Wednesday at Eldovil SDA church, where the children were heading on May 13 before they went missing.
