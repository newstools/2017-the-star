We want to get confirmation with the courts before releasing them,&rdquo; she said, adding that the prison will continue accommodating those unable to travel immediately.&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve removed the others from our records of prisoners. They are now free, but they can remain here as lodgers and if totally unable to travel, we will facilitate them,&rdquo; she said.Eleven others will remain to serve their reduced sentences.
