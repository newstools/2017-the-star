The Universities Academic Staff Union&rsquo;s 2013-17 collective bargaining agreement will become effective tomorrow, triggering a 17.5 per cent raise on basic salary and a 3.9 per cent house allowance for union members.The CBA was signed on March 13 after a 54-day strike that saw the government, under the Inter-Public Universities Consultative Council Forum, award the union Sh6 billion.A return-to-work formula was also signed to ensure universities do not victimise lecturers and union officials for participating in the industrial action. Uasu secretary general Constantine Wasonga (pictured) yesterday said they are anticipating that the government will keep its end of the bargain and implement the CBA. &ldquo;So far the government is not saying anything, so we are just waiting. After tomorrow we are going to take a position,&rdquo; he said.If implemented, academic staff will benefit from arrears that have accrued over the four years of the CBA, effective from July 1, 2013, to June 30 this year.Lecturers at Maasai Mara University are exempt from the CBA as they are beneficiaries of a previous higher pay rise.Wasonga said they are ready to go back to the streets if the government backtracks on the agreement.Under the CBA, the highest paid academic staff, a professor, will take home a monthly salary of Sh247,925, up from Sh211,000. Graduate assistants will take home Sh77,550, up from Sh66,000.The implementation of the 2013-17 CBA will pave way for negotiations for the 2017-21 CBA. IPUCCF and the government committed to immediately start new talks on the new CBA upon the implementation of the current one.
