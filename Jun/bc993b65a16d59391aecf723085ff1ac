A former Budalang’i MP has advised residents to be wary of politicians using money to woo them. Speaking at Ruambwa trading centre during his campaign trail on Wednesday, Raphael Wanjala told residents to cast their votes wisely as their leaders will determine the level of development. He is running for Budalang’i MP against incumbent Ababu Namwamba. Wanjala urged voters to elect “transparent and accountable leaders who will ensure every single cent is well spent”. If elected, he will allocate adequate CDF funds for the education of needy students, and also improve academic performance. He also promised to improve rice farming and put up a rice processing plant.
