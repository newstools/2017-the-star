Kitui Trade executive Jonah Mwinzi has said Governor Julius Malombe has delivered social and economic progress and deserves to be reelected.Speaking on Wednesday during the launch of Mwingi Youth Sacco, the first in Kitui to be formed with members from all 40 wards, Mwinzi said Malombe is focussed on improving lives.&ldquo;I am proud of this project. We are now seeing the fruits today with 250 youths to start with. Mwingi youths have tried a lot and you need to give them credit. That is why we are giving you a certificate to show you are fully registered. Go on now, but rest assured that you must get a loan to make the sacco viable,&rdquo; he said.Mwinzi said during Malombe&rsquo;s, 100 market shades have been constructed. He said Malombe&rsquo;s competitors sit under those very shades to campaign against him, saying he has done nothing.&ldquo; Fine, if they say so, but when they tell you such lies, ask them what they can show to you for the more than 10 years they have been in power compared to the four years Malombe has been in power. Tell them to show you any market shade they have erected,&rdquo; he said.
