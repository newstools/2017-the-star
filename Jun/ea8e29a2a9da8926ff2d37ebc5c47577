The High Court has ordered suspended police impostor Joshua Waiganjo's five-year jail term and ordered a fresh trial. Waiganjo was sentenced for impersonating a police officer, dressing in police uniform and being in possession of government stores. But judge Christine Meoli quashed the sentence noting he did not undergo a fair trial as crucial evidence was left out during hearing. She directed him to take plea at the Naivasha chief magistrate's court on June 13. Waiganjo has been at Naivasha GK prison for almost two years; following the sentencing on July 10, 2015. He had gone to the Court of Appeal saying the term was defective as his appointment letter was not considered during trial.

Kamau said the position of IG had not come into force when his client was charged with the office and another court had previously thrown out the charge. During judgement, Naivasha resident magistrate Shadrack Mwinzi acquitted Waiganjo of two counts of robbery with violence after the complainants failed to testify in court. But he sentenced Waiganjo to a year in prison for impersonating a police officer and six months each for three counts of being in possession of government stored. While quashing this ruling, the High Court directed that all witnesses be summoned for retrial.
