NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga is today expected to declare his position on the recently awarded ballot papers tender.The IEBC has warned that any court case against the contract will affect the August 8 polls date.Chief executive Ezra Chiloba yesterday told MPs an attempt to block the Sh2.5 billion contract given to Al Ghurair Printing and Publishing Company of Dubai will make it impossible to hold the general election.The caution was in response to a February nullification of the same tender by the High Court, after the opposition challenged it on grounds there were illegalities in its awarding. The cancellation dealt the IEBC a blow as it failed to meet the May 28 deadline for procuring ballots. The new contract was awarded last Friday.Al Ghurair is to print about 120 million ballot papers, election results forms and poll registers. The NASA Presidential Campaign Secretariat yesterday told the Star Raila will hold a press conference to make a pronouncement on the matter. &ldquo;Raila is closely following up the matter and will make an announcement over it tomorrow [today],&rdquo; NASA presidential campaign communication head Kathleen Openda said.Chiloba told the National Assembly Justice and Legal Affairs Committee that Al Ghurair was picked because it has modern machines and a capacity of 50 per cent is set aside for production of ballot papers.He said the company also has a suitable emergency production, packaging and delivery plan in addition to fully deployed experienced and qualified staff.&ldquo;There is always that risk that major tenders may attract a court challenge. If someone went to the courts today and the tender is put aside, the question we should be asking ourselves whether we would have the August elections,&rdquo; Chiloba said. He appeared before the committee chaired by Kisumu West MP Olago Aluoch to plead with MPs to ensure Sh2.5 billion allocated in the 2017-18 budget is moved to the supplementary budget for the commission for timely purchase of the ballot papers.
