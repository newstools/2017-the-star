Clearing agents have called on the Kenya Railways Corporation to clarify modalities of operations when the Standard Gauge Railway freight service starts in December.The SGR freight service was launched by President Uhuru Kenyatta on May 30 at the port of Mombasa, but operations are scheduled to start in December.The Kenya International Freight and Warehouse Association (Kifwa), the agents&rsquo; umbrella body, said yesterday they are still in the dark on how the SGR freight services will operate.Officials from the KRC, Kifwa claimed, failed to honour an invitation to a meeting with its directors yesterday at the Royal Court Hotel, Mombasa.&ldquo;They did not give a reason for failing to attend. We are, however, going to do another official communication to them,&rdquo; said Ojonyo.While welcoming the train freight services, poised to handle up to 80 per cent of cargo, the agents said they should be sensitised on the SGR freight operations, especially the cost, volumes to be handled and clearance modalities.&ldquo;We have been working with the Rift Valley Railways. We have also been working with the truckers. We now want the Kenya Railways Corporation to come and explain to us how different will the SGR be,&rdquo; Kifwa national chair William Ojonyo said.The cost of transporting a 20-feet container to Nairobi on truck, he said, ranges from Sh65,000 to Sh80,000 depending on the weight of a cargo.At an earlier engagement, KRC has hinted that the cost of the transporting the 20-feet container by the SGR will be around Sh50,000.Kifwa, however, says the cost of transporting cargo on SGR may slightly rise because importers will have to transport their cargo on road from the Nairobi Internal Container Depot to their warehouses or premises, unlike the trucks that deliver at the doorsteps.A 20-feet container costs between Sh15, 000 and Sh20,000 to transport within Nairobi, they estimated.Currently, truckers charge an average of Sh70,000 for a 20-feet container from port of Mombasa to the door step of the cargo owner. Trucks, however, take at least double the time the SGR is expected to take.&ldquo;Who will bear the additional charges of transporting a container from the ICD to the doorstep of the importer or cargo owner?&rdquo; posed Ojonyo, adding that KRC needs to come out and explain all these issues.He claimed the clearing agents work closely with the cargo owners and are better placed to advise them on the cost of doing business, hence the push for an engagement session.&ldquo;We are in business. We want to understand how SGR will be different from the truckers. How efficient will it be, and what will be the advantages compared to truckers,&rdquo; he said.
