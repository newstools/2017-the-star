The latest building collapse in Nairobi, that of a six-storey structure on Monday night in Kware on the Pipeline Estate, Embakasi, is a scandal.Five people are missing.After the collapse of a building on the Huruma estate, another poor area of the city, in June last year, City Hall marked many buildings as unfit for human habitation and placed them on a demolition list of more than 55 structures.But the buildings&rsquo; owners rushed to court and filed suit to prevent the demolitions.On April 21, 2016, a building marked for demolition collapsed, also in Huruma, Nairobi, killing 51 people.In May 2016, City Hall evacuated tenants in buildings that had been marked for demolition. The city&rsquo;s unsafe structures are the result of corrupt actions by a chain of actors, including their owners, building contractors, City Hall inspectors and the National Contractors&rsquo; Association of Kenya.Nairobi county Lands executive Christopher Khaemba said in March that only 41 out of the 2,000 earmarked for demolishing have been flattened.This is unacceptable.
