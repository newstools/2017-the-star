The Boni community in Basuba ward, Lamu East, is mourning an adopted member killed alongside seven security officers in an IED attack in Baure on Wednesday.Famau Mujahid, 39, was a madrassa and ECDE teacher at Mangai and a champion of Bonis&rsquo; rights.Two KDF officers who responded to the attack also lost their lives in yet another IED attack as they rushed to help. The death toll is nine.The IED is suspected to have been planted by al Shabaab militants.The father of three was described by the community as an honest man and a philanthropist.He was born in Kiunga, but at an early age he moved to Mangai village in Basuba, where he lived peacefully with the Bonis and even married two wives from the community.Despite being a Bajuni by birth, Mujahid is said to have quickly mastered the Boni language. After more than 20 years of mingling with the Bonis, they declared him one of their own.For a minority community that has been marginalised and left out of mainstream development, Bonis had come to view Mujahid as their voice.He advocated their needs and fought for their rights.Mujahid was one of the first registered community health volunteers for over 15 years. He mobilised resources and organised medical camps with the national and county governments.He is said to have stepped in to guard the Mangai dispensary after it was attacked and vandalised by Shabaab militants in June 2015.Mujahid was the chairperson of the area disaster management committee formed by the county government.&ldquo;He really fought to secure clean water from River Mangai for the Boni community during the recent drought. He contracted water boozers to supply clean water for the people of Kiunga and Basuba,&rdquo; resident Shee Kupi said of man, whose memory they cherish.Mujahid&rsquo;s was also a staunch environmentalist. Knowing the value of conservation to the Boni people, he stood firm in protecting the Boni Forest in Basuba.The Bonis are hunters and gatherers. They also harvest honey and believe they belong in the forest.In 2015, they were driven out of the forest by the government to allow Operation Linda Boni meant to flush out Shabaab militants.Mujahid always stood for them. He will also be remembered for being a proficient translator of the local dialect whenever there were visitors keen on helping them fix their problems. &ldquo;He was our eye,&rdquo; residents say in grief.
