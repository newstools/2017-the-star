Jubilee candidates in Murang’a county have zeroed in on women to ensure President Uhuru Kenyatta garners 100 per cent support. Led by woman representative Sabina Chege and Kandara MP Alice Wahome, they have formed a women’s group called Sauti ya Mama. The initiative is meant to include women in campaigns. The leaders said women have been largely left out in development projects yet they are the most affected by social issues. They said the opposition got 10,000 votes in 2013, but they are determined to deny them even these on August 8. The two spoke at Murang’a Teachers’ College on Wednesday in a meeting with 400 women. Chege urged women to be more aggressive in lobbying for Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto.  More Persuasive She said women are more persuasive than men. Chege said through the forum they will be dispatched to every party of the county to ensure every registered voter casts ballots for the Jubilee government. “Murang’a county is a Jubilee zone and we will ensure the President receives 100 per cent of all votes cast,” she said. Chege urged them to vote for Jubilee candidates to give Uhuru the numbers in the Senate and National Assembly. If the party gets fewer MPs, she said, it may create a crisis that may even lead to the formation of a coalition government. Chege urged women to run for office and to disregard personal attacks meant to intimidate them. Wahome praised the people of Murang’a for voting for three women MP candidates during the Jubilee Party nominations in April. “I was elected in Kandara, Mary Waithera in Maragua and Ruth Mwaniki in Kigumo.”
