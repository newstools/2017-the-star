NASA presidential campaign secretariat has dismissed claims that flag bearer Raila Odinga had asked for additional security personnel.This was after claims that the opposition chief had requested more officers that would have made his security detail comprise 50 officers.In a statement on Thursday, NASA said Raila had requested that the number of bodyguards is increased to 34 and not 50.Kathleen Openda of the secretariat said this included officers currently assigned to the opposition leader.The security officers man Raila's Bondo and Karen homes as well as the Capitol Hill offices."It behooves the state by law, to provide him (Raila) with the security detail commensurate with this status...a decision we leave at the behest of the Inspector General of Police.""Raila has no intention of forcing the national government to provide him with additional security personnel," she added.Earlier reports attributed to Raila's spokesman Dennis Onyango said the opposition chief asked IG Joseph Boinnet to expand his security detail from 16 to 50."Those guarding him are &lsquo;under strength&rsquo;," Onyango said.The Retirement Benefits (Deputy President and Designated State Officers) Act, No 8 of 2015 spells out seven benefits that the former PM and his running mate are entitled to, including three vehicles each. Two saloon cars of an engine capacity not exceeding 2,000cc and one four-wheel-drive vehicle of an engine capacity not exceeding 3,000cc, all of which will be replaceable every four years.Raila and Kalonzo are also entitled to two armed security officers who shall be provided on their request. The law also provides for three drivers to be attached to them.Read: Boinnet rejects Raila&rsquo;s request for 50 guards
