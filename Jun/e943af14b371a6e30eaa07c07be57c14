Broke members of the Nairobi assembly have extended their sittings by two weeks to &ldquo;earn allowance&rdquo;, although some MCAs cite &ldquo;pending business&rdquo;.Moving the procedural motion in the chamber on Thursday to effect the extension, majority leader Elias Otieno said the members&rsquo; pockets &ldquo;have ran dry after the draining nominations&rdquo;.&ldquo;Mr Speaker, I know you also feel it because you took part in them. They need to at least earn some allowance,&rdquo; Otieno said.The MCAs were expected to indefinitely adjourn last Thursday to enable them to prepare for the August 8 election. But they made a U-turn and pushed the last session to June 29.This means 127 MCAs will continue drawing sitting allowances for plenary and committee meetings in the extended period.Ward reps earn Sh3,900 per sitting, and most of them belong to at least two committees. The House teams sit at least four times a week, meaning each MCA will earn at least Sh62,400 or Sh7.9 million for all the members.Otieno further said the House has pending business that it does &ldquo;not want to pass to the next assembly&rdquo;.Some bills, motions, reports and petitions are pending conclusion, he says. Nairobi MCAs have passed 36 bills since 2013 and only four require their attention. They are: the Child Care Facilities Bill, the County Sports Management Bill, the Open Space Management Bill and the Appropriations Bill.Minority leader Abdi Guyo said, &ldquo;Some of the bills here are in second or third reading, and we don&rsquo;t want to die.&rdquo;Deputy speaker and Kware MCA Ken Ngondi said members should conclude pending issues to ensure they adjourn honourably. &ldquo;After being here for four years, it is only fair we leave the House in order,&rdquo; he said.Assembly clerk Jacob Ngwele yesterday said four key reports - three audit ones from the Public Accounts Committee - are yet to be tabled and debated.
