A notorious criminal who has been terrorizing residents of Witeithie Estate and its environs in Juja Sub-County of Kiambu County was on Saturday lynched by angry residents. According to Juja Sub-County AP Commandant Doreen Gitonga, the deceased was among a gang that had raided a residence near Molo area in the wee hours of Saturday.The AP Boss said tenants heard a commotion as the thugs broke into a shop and raised the alarm attracting neighbours. The cries for help prompted the thugs to escape with members of the public in hot pursuit. Gitonga said the deceased stumbled and fell after hitting an electrical pole support cord.A mob that had given chase caught up with him and beat him senseless."They then dosed him with petrol and set him on fire," Gitonga said.The other suspects managed to escape, she added. Gitonga said the badly burnt body was initially taken to Juja Police Station but later moved to City Mortuary. Juja OCPD Patricia Narsio however warned members of the public against taking the law into their own hands. &ldquo;Such suspects should not be subjected to mob justice. When you kill these suspects you also kill a lot of vital information that would have helped in unearthing criminal activities within the society,&rdquo; said the police Chief.Witeithie Estate had until recently enjoyed relative calm until incidents of lawlessness started emerging. Juja Sub-County Deputy County Commissioner Muthama Wambua is scheduled to visit the area for a public baraza next Tuesday.He is expected to address a couple of issues including insecurity especially as the general elections draw closer.
