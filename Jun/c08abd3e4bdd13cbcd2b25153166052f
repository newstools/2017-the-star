ODM&rsquo;s calls for six-piece voting have not gone down well in some areas in Nyanza, NASA&rsquo;s presidential candidate Raila Odinga&rsquo;s stronghold. Raila has urged his supporters, especially from Nyanza, to elect ODM candidates, saying he will need the numbers in the National Assembly and the Senate when he becomes President.Nominated Senator Oburu Oginga and Homa Bay woman representative Gladys Wanga, who have been tasked with delivering the presidential votes, have hit the ground with the same message. It used to be that whoever Raila endorsed would get an automatic ticket to Parliament. However, this now seems uncertain, especially after the shambolic primaries. business unusualSpeaking to the Star on Saturday, Homa Bay county Bunge la Wenyenchi speaker Walter Opiyo urged Raila to focus his energies on the presidency and let the people elect representatives of their own choice.&ldquo;Raila should know that his presidential votes, especially in Nyanza, are safe. For the other seats he should respect the will of the people, since he acknowledged that the primaries had some hitches. We are all in NASA, including the independents,&rdquo; he said.Opiyo said it will not be business as usual on August 8 since the times when people used to &ldquo;clutch onto Raila&rsquo;s coat&rdquo; are gone.He said Wanga, who has been on the receiving end for supporting six-piece voting, is only doing her job since she is the county chairperson. In Homa Bay, the main tussle is between Governor Cyprian Awiti of ODM and Oyugi Magwanga, an independent. Magwanga feels he was denied victory during the party primaries.He says, however, that he supports Raila&rsquo;s presidency. Others are Medo Misama and Tom Alila of Jubilee.
