We have resolved to back Raila&rsquo;s presidential bid.&rdquo;He claimed the huge crowds witnessed during Uhuru&rsquo;s trip to the region was &lsquo;hired&rsquo;. &ldquo;When the President was compensating IDPS in his stronghold, the IDPS were being given houses, land and Sh400,000 each to start life afresh,&rdquo; Njiraini said.&ldquo;In NASA strongholds, the IDPS were discriminated, only given Sh51, 000; no land or house. The amount given is just peanuts.&rdquo; Njiraini defended the opposition against claims that it wants ICC Kenyan cases revived.
