Kenya ranks among the top five countries on the continent which have robust corporate governance codes of practice which positively impact economic prosperity, a new study by the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants and KPMG shows. The study, &lsquo;Balancing Rules and Flexibility for Growth&rsquo;, focused on 15 countries in Africa. It examined the corporate governance requirements for listed companies against the OECD benchmarks across four tenets of corporate governance. South Africa emerged tops, having adopted the largest number of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development principles released in 2015, according to the study. Kenya, Mauritius, Nigeria and Uganda completed the top five list. Overall, 10 out of 15 markets studied by the two organisations have aligned their corporate governance requirements with more than 80 per cent of OECD principles. &ldquo;Kenya has had corporate governance codes for some time and the experience of implementing them has created practical learning points. The East African markets will leverage the lessons learned in the evolution of similar codes in other markets,&rdquo; Head of Audit Committee Institute at KPMG David Leahy said. Leahy added implementing corporate governance will prepare companies for the opportunities that come with the anticipated high growth rates in Africa. ACCA director for sub-Saharan Africa Jamil Ampomah stressed the need for more awareness and strengthening remaining critical areas of corporate governance, particularly remuneration structures, performance evaluation, risk governance and board composition and diversity. &ldquo;Achieving the right balance between rules and flexibility is a tricky task for any country, but of fundamental importance is to support robust economic growth,&rdquo; Ampomah said.
