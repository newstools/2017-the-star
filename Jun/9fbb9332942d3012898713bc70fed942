The era of ghost workers and impostors at City Hall will soon come to an end after the county government announced the introduction of biometric identity cards for its workers.The county is running trials with plans to enrol all 13,000 employees in a month.&ldquo;It has proved viable. We are now just concluding the payment process because we have already tendered for the cards,&rdquo; county secretary Robert Ayisi said. He said residents have for many years been duped by imposters because there was no proper way of identifying genuine employees.&ldquo;If you look at the card, it will give you all the information about the holder. It will make a very big impact because it will remove impostors and masqueraders at the county,&rdquo; Ayisi said.Many people, some former employees, have been arrested for impersonating workers, faking documents and defrauding the county of millions of shillings.In July last year, five people were arrested with fake building plans and approvals, occupational and public health certificates and receipts. Speaking to the Star at City Hall last Thursday, Ayisi said that the county will introduce new uniforms for Inspectorate officers.The county will also train staff on culture change to do way with the &lsquo;kanjo&rsquo; culture characterised by brutality and torture.The uniforms will include ceremonial and regular attire.&ldquo;The Inspectorate is the face of the county. The first-line people Nairobians meet are the Inspectorate workers. So we have to reform, rebrand and have them change the way they operate,&rdquo; Ayisi said.He said senior managers, including the governor and his deputy, executives, chief officers and directors have undergone the culture change programme.
