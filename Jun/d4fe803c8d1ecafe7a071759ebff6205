Children who pile on weight in their teenage years are 80 per cent more likely to suffer a stroke as adults.Being overweight as a child does not appear to lead to a stroke in later life. But boys of a normal weight at the age of eight see their risk soar if they overeat during puberty.In a warning to teenagers with a love of junk food, a study has linked teenage weight gain with high blood pressure in adulthood.Researchers at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden suggest it is high blood pressure, known to weaken blood vessels in the brain, which raises the risk of having a stroke.They found average eight-year-old boys who became overweight aged 20 had an 80 per cent increased risk of suffering a stroke in later life. Every two point increase in BMI, above a healthy range, increased the odds by 20 per cent.The study followed 37,669 men for an average of 38 years, during which 918 of them suffered a stroke.Co-author Dr Jenny Kindblom noted: "The stroke rate has been increasing among young adults even while it has been decreasing for older people. While we don't know the reasons for this increase, it has occurred at the same time as the obesity epidemic."Every five minutes someone in Britain suffers a stroke, which occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off.Obesity raises the risk of ischaemic stroke by clogging the arteries with fatty deposits which can cause a blood clot, cutting off the blood supply to the brain. It can also cause a haemorrhagic stroke, where a weakened blood vessel supplying the brain bursts.The new study shows this risk may begin in childhood, when the seeds are sown for high blood pressure which damages blood vessels.Overweight children who become fat adults have a 70 per cent higher risk of suffering a stroke, but that rises to 80 per cent for those who start out at a healthy weight. This suggests rapid weight gain during puberty is more dangerous.The researchers, whose study is published in the journal Neurology, measured the men's BMI at eight and then at 20, following them for decades afterwards.Of the 1,800 who were normal weight at age eight and overweight as young adults, 67 had a stroke - or 3.7 percent. There were 990 people who were overweight at ages eight and 20, of whom 36, or 3.6 per cent, went on to have a stroke.The study also found that people with high increases in BMI from age 8 to age 20 also were more likely to have high blood pressure as adults. People with high blood pressure are more likely to have stroke.Dr Kindblom said the obesity rates in the study group of men born in 1945 to 1961 were lower than current rates. She concluded: "Today's environment that is so conducive to obesity may even further heighten the relationship we saw between increase in BMI and risk of stroke."
