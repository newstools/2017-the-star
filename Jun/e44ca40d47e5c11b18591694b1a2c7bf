Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong has warned Busia leaders against betraying NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga, saying he has been the cornerstone in their political journey.He said Raila also helped shape the destiny of Budalang&rsquo;i MP Ababu Namwamba by giving him a ministerial post, but the MP is now leading the crusade to undermine the former PM.&ldquo;I encourage leaders to walk with Raila, considering his role in liberating this country,&rdquo; Ojaamong said.He spoke on Friday at Nangina Youth Polytechnic, when he donated chairs to 18 ECDE schools from Nangina ward.During the ceremony, 16 public schools walked away with 70 chairs each and two private schools received 20 chairs each. Ojaamong sharply differed with those peddling rumours that his government has performed dismally, saying his administration has carried out several projects such as roads, street lighting and construction of ECDE classrooms.&ldquo;You will find people seated in Nairobi, claiming we have done nothing. They should come to the ground and see what we have done,&rdquo; he said.He exuded confidence that he will be reelected. He also predicted a clear win for NASA.Ojaamong promised to incorporate ECDE teachers in the next budget to have them become permanent and pensionable.Area MCA Nangina John Obwogo condemned the culture of Busia elders of endorsing each and every candidate, urging them to have a firm stand.&ldquo;Today you endorse this candidate, tomorrow so and so. What kind of endorsement is this?&rdquo; he asked.
