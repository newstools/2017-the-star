Mombasa governor hopeful Hezron Awiti&rsquo;s running mate Hassan Mwamtoa will be introduced on July 1 in Likoni.He comes from the Mijikenda community. The subtribes&rsquo; elders settled on him after vigorous searching.The IEBC cleared Mwamtoa alongside Awiti, who said he is the only horse in the race and the rest are &lsquo;donkeys&rsquo;.Making the announcement on Friday at the Royal Castle Hotel, Awiti also spelt out his plans for his first 100 days in office. The Nyali MP said he will repossess all the parcels of land owned by absentee landlords who have failed to develop them. The plots will be divided among squatters based on advice from a Lands Committee to be formed.Land is a thorny issue in Mombasa, despite numerous efforts by governments to find a lasting solution.But the Vibrant Democratic Party leader said forced repossession will end the disputes.&ldquo;Our administration will, however, not target private lands whose owners are present and have improved them,&rdquo; Awiti said.He added that squatters have been occupying the land for more than 100 years. Awiti said he will divide the county government into six subcounty levels.&ldquo;Each will have its independent administrator who will be supervised by the county service board,&rdquo; he said.Awiti said there will be better services if functions are devolved, in contrast with the current situation in which power is concentrated in the governor&rsquo;s office.He said each subcounty will have its own office for easy coordination.Awiti said Mombasa will be zoned for better development. His manifesto features the Village College, in which the grassroots dictates which projects they want implemented, through experts&rsquo; guidance.
