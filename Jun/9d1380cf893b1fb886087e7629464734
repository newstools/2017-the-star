The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission has been told to be wary of hackers who might infiltrate the system that will transmit results during the August 8 General Election.Communications Authority of Kenya director general Francis Wangusi (pictured) yesterday asked the IEBC to use appropriate systems in the storage of their data so as to curb hackers.&ldquo;I want to caution my brothers at the IEBC not to host any data on the cloud. This might be disastrous because we do not even have laws in this country that govern such form of storage. I agree that our website was once hacked,&rdquo; Wangusi said.The commission should ensure all results it will transmit via mobile technology are thoroughly audited, so as to enhance transparency and credibility.Wangusi said all simcards to be used during the exercise will be registered, so that they can be traced.It will also ensure quality of service during the transmission of results.&ldquo;We proposed to come up with a high breed of technologies from our three main mobile operators so as to cover the areas which are not covered by 3G.He said 3G is the appropriate technology to transmit data, voice and pictures, and it will enhance credibility and transparency of the election.&ldquo;The country was sub-divided into three zones to allow the three mobile operators to use a high-breed technology and ensure that all the polling stations are electronically connected,&rdquo; Wangusi said.He assured that mobile networks will be offered high security.
