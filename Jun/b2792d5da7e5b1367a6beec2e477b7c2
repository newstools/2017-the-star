The High Court yesterday issued orders extending receivership status at collapsed Imperial Bank for another 90 days from June 23. The Central Bank of Kenya said the orders were sought following agreement with Kenya Deposit Insurance Corporation and shareholders that it was necessary for KDIC, the receiver manager, to be accorded more time to resolve the receivership. &ldquo;All agree on the urgency of a resolution and on the need to safeguard the interest of the depositors,&rdquo; CBK and KDIC said in a joint statement yesterday. The shareholders in February filed a contempt of court case against CBK Governor Patrick Njoroge and KDIC CEO Mahmoud Mohamed alongside the board of directors accusing them of defying a court&rsquo;s directive requiring them to reveal information relating to receivership of the bank. Following the last 90 day extension issued in March 24, CBK and KDIC have held four meetings with the shareholders, the regulator said. The two said they plan to continue engaging stakeholders concerning the next steps in the resolution of IBL. CBK initially placed IBL under receivership on October 13, 2015 due to financial irregularities and malpractices that dogged the bank exposing its customers to the risk of loss. A year later, the regulator further extended the lender&rsquo;s receivership period by six month to April 14, 2017. &ldquo;CBK and KDIC again reiterate their commitment to protecting the interest of IBLR depositors, its creditors, and the wider public interest, by resolving IBLR&rsquo;s receivership in a professional and legal manner,&rdquo; the statement read.
