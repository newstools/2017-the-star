Kenya have what it takes to rule the region&rsquo;s basketball once again, according to Uganda national team head coach Juruni Mandy.Speaking yesterday at Nyayo Stadium gymnasium, Juruni observed that if the Kenyan league draws players from across the region and also trains well for international events, things will change.&ldquo;There are players here who can do your country proud during regional and continental tournaments but there must be proper preparations if results are to be positive,&rdquo; said the coach handling Kampala City team in the on going Africa City Challenge.He attributes Uganda league structure as one reason why the national team has replaced Kenya and Rwanda as number one in the region currently. Juruni will lead Uganda to Afro Basket slated for Angola in September after Kenya failed to qualify. &ldquo;The Uganda league has players from DR Congo, Rwanda, Burundi, Kenya and even Americans. This has helped it grow in leaps and bounds,&rdquo; said Juruni, whose Kampala City team has three Kenyans in Phil Ameny, Mike Makiadi and Brian Namake.His sentiments were strengthened by Nairobi Morans hard fought 59-55 victory over Kampala on Tuesday night in a hard fought cracker that had seven ties and seven lead changes. Meanwhile, guard Victor Odendo remains doubtful for the rest of the games. The tigerish Odendo, fondly refered to as &ldquo;Jet&rdquo; did not dress for that crucial match against Kampala .According to coach Ben Oluoch, Odendo has a strong fever that knocked him out of that epic. &ldquo;He is key to our plans and with only a rotation of 10 players, we are hopeful he will have recovered fully,&rdquo; said a worried Oluoch.
