Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero has ordered the immediate stoppage of construction of the Kenya Railways houses in Kibera after a wall collapsed and killed three people.The wall collapsed on Wednesday evening, following a heavy downpour. The governor visited the site yesterday. Speaking to the Star, Kidero said the county government established that the wall was weak, an indication the contractor used substandard materials. &ldquo;The wall came down when it rained on Wednesday evening. Water passed through some houses and swept away three people,&rdquo; he said.The body of a woman was recovered, but two others are yet to be found.Kidero said the wall could not withstand the floodwaters from the upper side of the slum. &ldquo;We have ordered the contractor to stop the construction until we conclude investigations,&rdquo; he said.The Kenya Railways Corporation erected the wall under the Relocation Action Plan along the railway corridor in Nairobi&rsquo;s Kibera, Makongeni and Mukuru slums.The World Bank funds the project.The Nairobi governor said the county will not allow further construction of the Kenya Railways houses and wall in Kibera until investigation of the quality of the work is audited to satisfaction.He ordered the contractor to surrender himself to City Hall officers.&ldquo;He [contractor] has not even come to say sorry to the affected residents. We have now told him to stop the entire project,&rdquo; Kidero said.
