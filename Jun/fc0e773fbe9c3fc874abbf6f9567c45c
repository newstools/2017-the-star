Taveta MP Naomi Shaban has warned Jubilee supporters against campaigning for governor candidates in other parties. Shaban (pictured) said some people back Jubilee during the day, and  NASA at night. During a leaders’ dialogue meeting in Mwatate on Saturday, attended by Jubilee aspirants and government officials, some residents were heard saying they will support Granton Samboja for Taita Taveta  governor and not Jubilee’s Dan Mwazo. Residents say some leaders have been imposed on them.
