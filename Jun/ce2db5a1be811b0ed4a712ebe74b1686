Deputy President William Ruto has cautioned the opposition against dragging the military into issues pertaining to politics.Ruto said the military was a professional body that should be left to do its work of protecting the country and should not be linked to politics."Our military men and women are professionals who should be left to do their work and should not be dragged into issues to do with elections." "They should sell their agenda to Kenyans to woo their support and leave the military out of the August general election," Ruto said.Addressing a rally in Tassia grounds in Embakasi East constituency, Nairobi on Tuesday, the DP said the National Super Alliance (NASA) leaders have sensed defeat and had panicked situation, less than two months to the August 8 polls.He said the opposition was clutching on anything to muddy the elections with the hope of negotiating a coalition government. "Those in opposition are now complaining because they have no agenda and track record for Kenyans. They have even gone further to claim that votes will be stolen. They have sensed defeat and want a way to negotiate power after Jubilee wins," Ruto said.The DP was accompanied by Senator Mike Sonko (Nairobi), Beatrice Elachi (Nominated), MPs Rachel Shebesh (Nairobi), Johnstone Sakaja (Nominated).He told the opposition that Kenyans will go for polls in August 8, whether its prepared or not.The leaders also said NASA was employing threats to other communities to precipitate chaos after elections.They singled out remarks attributed to flag bearer Raila Odinga to the effect that the Masai community should not sell their land to outsiders, which they said was akin to asking non-Masai to leave their land."Our friends in opposition should be ready for election in August 8 whether they like it or nor because Kenyans will go to polls as stipulated in the Constitution," Ruto said.Ruto, at the same time, assured Kenyans that the government will protect their lives and property in any part of the country.He said while Jubilee was building bridges of friendship among all Kenya&rsquo;s different communities the opposition was erecting walls of tribalism."We want to assure Kenyans that we will protect lives and property in any part of this country," Ruto said.He appealed to Nairobi voters to support Jubilee candidates come the August polls.Sonko said he was confident voters in Nairobi will give him the opportunity to serve them as their governor."I want to assure you that my leadership will improve sevice delivery in our city so that you have a County that you will all be proud of," Sonko said.Read: Uhuru preparing military to rig the election, claims Raila
