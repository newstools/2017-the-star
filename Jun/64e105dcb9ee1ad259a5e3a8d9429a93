Nairobi&rsquo;s underground cabling project aimed at providing alternative electricity supply in case of a blackout within the main lines is 20 per cent complete, state-controlled Kenya Power said yesterday.The Sh13.2 billion project, which is initially being rolled out in Nairobi, is targeted at improving power distribution for customers within the city centre, industrial and surrounding areas. This will also reduce risks and maintenance costs arising from vandalism and other forms of interference, acting managing director Ken Tarus said.Upon completion, the near-monopoly power distributor sees a more stable and reliable electricity supply for Nairobi residents.The project was launched in September 2016 following a two-month delay due to lengthy negotiations for wayleaves with public institutions.&ldquo;This project is perhaps 20 per cent of our network within the city. So when we get resources we will continuously carry out the undergrounding,&rdquo; he said.The first phase of the project, which covers the Western side of Nairobi, will transmit power from the Embakasi substation to the new City Centre substation near the Laico Regency Hotel.Through the underground cable network, electricity will further be supplied to the Likoni Road substation, Nairobi West, Cathedral, City Square, Muthurwa and Parklands substations.&ldquo;We are first looking at the Western part of Nairobi then we shall look at connecting the other parts of the city,&rdquo; Tarus said. &ldquo;We do not have an exact timeline for the project because it will be dependent on when we get the resources.&rdquo;Tarus said that 22 of the planned 30.71 kilometres of the proposed 66 kiloVolt alternative network is currently complete, while pre-commissioning tests at the Likoni Road substation are currently underway.Kenya Power, he added, plans to roll out the project to the rest of the country in the near future as the firm moves towards expanding and enhancing the capacity of the power distribution network. The long-term target is to replace the overhead lines.&ldquo;Initially focused on Nairobi, the underground cabling project will involve construction of a new substation and associated lines to increase the length of the existing network and offer alternative supply points to minimise interruptions,&rdquo; Tarus said.The first phase of the underground cable network, which is funded by a 20-year concessional loan from China Exim Bank, was initially expected to be completed by next month.The project is being implemented by China&rsquo;s TBEA Co as the main contractor and Voacom Networks, H.K Builders and AKS as domestic subcontractors.&ldquo;Once the cost of managing and maintaining the system is brought down this might eventually translate to the low cost of power,&rdquo; Tarus said.
