The high court on Thursday released 41 inmates at the Lang'ata Women Maximum Prison after reviewing their sentences.Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu said 38 left the correctional facility on Friday while the others will remain briefly, and leave after completing their reduced jail terms."Those freed include a Tanzanian and two Burudian immigrants jailed for being in the country illegally with orders to be repatriated after completing their jail terms", she said. The foreigners were in incarceration after courts ordered them to pay fines and be repatriated or serve a jail term before the repatriation.But judges who reviewed their sentences recommended they be released and repatriated immediately instead of staying in the prison.The judges considered the duration each offender spent in pre-trial detention.They also looked into the period the inmates have spent in jail as convicts and their post-conviction behaviour as recorded by the prison, among other factors to determine those to be released.Read: [VIDEO] Tears of joy as over 600 Shimo la Tewa prisoners set free after Uhuru pardonMwilu said this will decongest the prison and give the inmates opportunity to regain the freedom to enjoy their lives.Officer in charge of the prison Olivia Onyango forwarded the prisoners' files to the judges for review.Mwilu led Lady Justice Hannah Okwengu of the court of appeal, the principal judge in the high court's criminal division Jessie Lesiit, Justice Lydia Achode and Grace Ngenye, high court registrar Ann Amandi, and several magistrates to celebrate the Madaraka Day with inmates at the correctional centre.She said the regular reviewing of prisoners sentences will be carried out in other prisons to ensure that those who should be set free are released."It is only fair to pardon some of the inmates and the criteria used is based on the behaviour of the inmates and the sentences that they were serving," Mwilu said.Mwilu said the penal code should be amended to be sensitive to those in conflict with the law.She said that some cases take too long to be heard thus causing psychological torture to offenders reprimanded in prisons.Also read; [PHOTOS] Woman accused of stabbing boyfriend 22 times crowned Miss Langata prison
