A 38-year-old man has been charged after secretly livestreaming his colleague as she squeezed milk out of her breast. The woman, who said she was "furious" at having been "sexualised in such a cowardly way", was expressing the milk - squeezing it out so it can be stored for a later date - at the University of Cape Town in South Africa. Her male colleague, who has been suspended by the university, is alleged to have set up a live video feed while she released the milk in a private room on June 13. He has been charged and is now being investigated for a case of 'crimen injuria' - intentional harming of a person's dignity - and the trial is being held at Wynberg Magistrate&rsquo;s Court, according to The South African. The mother, who has not been named, wrote in a blog that she has "struggled with many emotions and questions" since the incident. "I&rsquo;m so incredibly angry that the act of me providing food for my baby was sexualised in such a cowardly way," she said. "That it was sexualised at all...I&rsquo;m disgusted that we live in a world where mothers, no matter how they choose to feed their children, are victimised for being vulnerable."She added: "I&rsquo;m frustrated that during unguarded moments, my own ridiculous internalised 'isms' make me feel guilty about all of this."
