The private universities face hard times after the vast majority of those who qualified for intake were absorbed by the public universities (see P14).One result of falling undergraduate numbers in private universities is the closure announced yesterday of four campuses of the University of Eastern Africa, Baraton, and the laying off of close to 1,000 staff.Baraton follows in the footsteps of Kemu, which also closed a number of campuses earlier this year.It is a good thing the public universities are absorbing so many students. And it is high time the private campuses developed alternative plans to become more creative and innovative with their programmes. The example of Strathmore University, which is fully functional, is instructive. They could borrow a leaf from the former polytechnics, which are making a comeback as technical and vocational training institutions under the TVET Board, which regulates, registers and accredits institutions, programmes and trainers.After all, Education CS Fred Matiang&rsquo;i has said more than once the state has plans to include private universities in admitting state-funded students.
