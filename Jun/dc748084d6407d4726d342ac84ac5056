The High Court has quashed criminal charges against Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya over his failure to appear before the Senate Public Accounts Committee.Justice George Odunga said the charge was without basis given the Governor was cleared by the County Assembly of misuse of public funds.The judge prohibited DPP Keriako Tobiko from sustaining Oparanya's prosecution on the charge saying it lacks merits in law.The court further found and held that summons issued by the Senate were not in compliance with the law."There was already an order from the courts stopping the Senate from effecting its summons against the governor, which it disobeyed."Justice Odunga further ordered the criminal charge before the chief magistrate's court terminated.The Governor was to be charged on December 14, 2015 as recommended by the DPP.But he moved to the High Court to challenge the criminal indictment and obtained an order barring the DPP from prosecuting him.The Senate PAC, chaired by Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale, wanted the county chief to answer to audit queries arising from the financial year 2013/14 budget.Clerk Jeremiah Nyegenye complained to the DPP about Oparanya&rsquo;s failure to appear before the committee to respond to queries raised by the Auditor General.The county boss surrendered to Muthaiga police after the DPP ordered his arrest. He was released on Sh10,000 bond.Read: Senators adopt Kakamega 2013/14 audit queries, want Oparanya held accountable
