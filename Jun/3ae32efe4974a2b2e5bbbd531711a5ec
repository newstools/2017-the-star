So far, there has been no cogent discussion of issues by the presidential contest candidates for the 12th General Election scheduled for August 8. Instead, the main contenders have staged show-of-might rallies and roadside appearances at which there has been a proliferation of personalized attacks, including on non-players in the race.Kenyans have had a campaign debate diet of &ldquo;Raila did that, Ruto did this, Uhuru did that, Mudavadi did this, Wetang&rsquo;ula did that and Rutto did this&rdquo;. Sometimes the non-issues being bandied about concern the events of years ago, such as the unresolved Goldenberg and Anglo Leasing multi-billion-shilling scams.But what Kenyans want to see are not the record crowds the main contenders are attracting even at impromptu roadside stops. They want to know how the next government intends to spend their taxes, ensure security, offer healthcare and whether their children will get quality free education. And how the next President and his team propose to achieve all this. Gentlemen, let&rsquo;s have an issues-based campaign 58 days to August 8.
