Retired President Daniel Moi has won an eight-year land case against the Samburu community.The Samburu community, led by Joseph Lekamario and 248 others, moved to court to block any transfer of the 17,105 acre parcel in Laikipia from Moi to the Africa Wildlife Foundation or to the Kenya Wildlife Service.The community accused Moi of illegally transferring 17,105 acres of their ancestral land in Eland Down, Laikipia North, to the AWF and then to KWS. The case against Moi, AWF and KWS started in 2009.The community&rsquo;s lawyer, Suiyanka Lempaa, also wanted to block eviction of the Samburu from the Kabarak Farm or Eland Down land, where more than 6,000 community members have been living since 1984.The landmark judgment was delivered at the Nyeri Environment and Land Court on Tuesday.Justice Lucy Waithaka said the community had never owned the land and it did not prove its claim of adverse possession. She added that the court is not the right forum to address the historical injustices of the Samburu community.The community relies on the land for their lives, livelihoods, sustenance and survival.The community members have peaceably and openly enjoyed facilities such as boreholes, dams, water courses, rivers and stock routes in the suit property for more than 20 years.The judge dismissed the case and directed the community to pay the cost of the suit, adding that it lacks merit.But lawyer Lempaa said the Samburu will appeal the court&rsquo;s decision as it is unsatisfactory and harsh to the community.Moi was represented in the case by lawyer Juma Kiplenge, while lawyer James Muthui represented AWF and lawyer Ambonya Wachira represented KWS.Lempaa argued that the community had been living on the land&rsquo;s Kisangei village since the 1980s, before Moi took it in 1997 in circumstances they did not understand.Lempaa alleged the land was transferred to AWF by the former President and converted to Laikipia National Park by the KWS.Former chief executive officer of Olpejeta Conservancy, Richard Highnoor, appeared as a defence witness in the matter.He told the court that Moi bought the land in 1997 from the conservancy, which was fenced and padlocked.Fred Kapondi, the former chairman of the parliamentary Committee on Administration and National Security, said the committee visited the land following threats to employees by individuals living nearby.Yash Pal Ghai, who was listed as the second interested party, said the case concerned historical injustice.&ldquo;Great injustices were committed during colonisation through seizure of huge tracts of land belonging to communities. The National Land Commission has failed to discharge its mandate of investigating and redressing historical injustices,&rdquo; he once told the court.The judge said KWS, AWF and Moi had been in control of the disputed land for all the material time.The community now faces eviction from the land.
