The hearing of Eldoret farmer-politician Jackson Kibor’s divorce case yesterday was postponed to July 6. His wife Josephine Jepkoech’s lawyer Amos Magut asked for adjournment to attend to pressing matters. Kibor, 86, wants a divorce after 51 years. He denies he wants the divorce because Jepkoech placed a caveat on 200 acres he wanted to sell. “I don’t want her because she travelled to Canada to live with her children, abandoning me and without my authority,” Kibor said. For the second time yesterday he protested before principal magistrate Charles Obulutsa that the case has taken too long because of the many postponements. “I want this case to end quickly so I can go on with other things,” he said. Kibor filed for divorce a year ago, accusing his wife of desertion, cruelty, denial of conjugal rights and interfering with ownership of 800 acres in Kipkabus, Uasin Gishu county. Jepkoech will conclude her testimony and the court will also hear from a daughter who opposes the divorce.
