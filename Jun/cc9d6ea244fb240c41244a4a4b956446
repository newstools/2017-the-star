Shaffi Bakari, one of the newest national team members, is among the Kenyan boxers who have qualified for the AIBA World Championship in Humburg, Germany.Bakari, a product of Mombasa boxing ranks and a member of the 2011 Commonwealth&rsquo; Junior Games in the Isle of Man, booked a place in the semi-finals after victory against Moussiessie Francel in the ongoing Africa Boxing Championship. Olympian Nick Okoth (lightweight) and John Kyalo also qualified for the semis to book places in the global championship that will be held in October.It was a bad day at the office for Tobias Okeyo who lost to Christian Ndzie Tsoye of Cameroon in the quarters to bow out of the continental extravaganza. Light heavyweight Elly Ajowi also lost to Kaonga Mbachi of Zambia in the quarters and so was Victor Ater, who succumbed to Mbaya Mulumba. Martin Oduor also lost to Vadamotoo Jean.It was a bitter pill for Ater to swallow considering his win over Mahatonga Cedrick that earned him a quarters ticket was even tougher. Oduor beat Molawantwa George to advance to quarters but failed to reach the last four. Okoth will now fight Hamout Mohamed in today&rsquo;s semis while Shaffi will slug it out with Humunyela Matias. Kyalo will be up against Abdin Bakr as the four Kenyans are assured of a bronze medal should they fail to advance to the finals.The 19th AIBA World Boxing Championships will feature global top 280 elite male boxers for the first time in the new Olympic cycle to Tokyo 2020. Qualification for Hamburg comes in the form of the AIBA Continental Championships held between last month and this month.The road to Hamburg began in the Uzbekistan capital of Tashkent, with the ASBC Asian Championships running from April 30 to May 7 before paving way to the Brazzaville, Congo for the Africa show.
