He has been denied an opportunity to record a statement in relation to the charges,&rdquo; he said.The lawyer further submitted that assets in question, related to Islamic assets Musharakah, were held in trust and have been returned while negotiations are underway for the remaining ones.He also noted the bank has been under Central Bank's control since collapsing in April 2016.Miller further said a report had since exonerated his client.The prosecution said charges against Khan were not aimed at blocking his treatment.The magistrate said the accused is free to leave the country to see doctors but must surrender his passport after returning.
