The police post that was built at Piggiot Place in Old Town, Mombasa, was a waste of taxpayer money, governor hopeful Hassan Omar has said.He said the land on which the police post has been built is public and was used for barazas and other community meetings.The police post was built in 2016, following increased insecurity in Old Town. It was constructed 500 metres from the Central police station.On Sunday, Omar said the National Museums of Kenya was against the construction of the police post, because it was built on a historical open piece of land, which should be preserved. &ldquo;How can you construct a police post 500 metres from a police station? Police posts are always constructed or put up in areas that have no presence of security personnel,&rdquo; he said.Omar spoke during a ceremony to award winners of the Quran Recitation Competition for children aged under 15. It was organised by Old Town MCA aspirant Athman Abdhalla of the Timberland Foundation.The police post was funded by the Mvita CDF office under the patronage of MP Abdulswamad Nassir.&ldquo;I do not know why this construction was allowed to continue. Inshallah, Abdulswamad, the same way he constructed this building, he should also do the same to demolish it so that people can have a place to converge,&rdquo; Omar said.He said before construction of the police post, he had engaged Coast regional coordinator Nelson Marwa and the area MP not to take away the public land from the people.&ldquo;I told Marwa, Abdulswamad and the National Museums of Kenya that they should not take away this piece of land from the people of Old Town in the name of fighting insecurity,&rdquo; Omar said.He said it is more than one year since construction was completed, but no officer has been posted there.&ldquo;It is now urgent that we should get back this Piggiot Place land,&rdquo; he said.MCA aspirant Abdhalla said he will work to restore security in Old Town.&ldquo;I will work to ensure we continue with these kinds of activities so as to continue fighting crime. We shall put up security gates around this area to curb crime,&rdquo; he said.
