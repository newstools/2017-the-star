Mombasa City has replaced Kigali in the six-team Africa Inter-Cities Challenge that throws off on Sunday at the Nyayo Stadium gymnasium. Inter Cities tournament secretary, Michael Finley, confirmed Mombasa have agreed to send a team to Nairobi for the championships that has a lucrative prize tag of Sh1.8 million. They now join Kampala, Dar-es-Salaam, Juba, Mogadishu and Nairobi. “Kigali notified us that they will not be able to send a team to the championships because of their tight programme. They said their budget is also stretched after sending their junior teams to the Fiba Africa U-16 and U-18 show in Mombasa,” said Owino. Tournament organiser, Michael Finley, said the preparations are complete. On the national league front, Blades dismissed Kenya College of Accountancy (KCA) University  71-57 in a premier league clash at Nyayo Stadium gymnasium over the weekend. Blades took a 18—17 lead in the first quarter before going full throttle in the second with a huge 25-11 advantage. The third quarter belonged to KCA who had a close 12-10 cushion before Blades again took over 19-16 in the last.
