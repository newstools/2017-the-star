Kiambu Governor William Kabogo says he supports President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s reelection because of his transformational agenda, but he opposes six-piece voting as undemocratic.Kabogo is running for reelection as an independent against Jubilee&rsquo;s Ferdinand Waititu, his fierce rival.He said on Friday voters should be allowed to elect leaders of their choice and subjecting Kenyans to six-piece voting would compromise development.Opposition alliance NASA is advocating a six-piece vote.&ldquo;Kenyans should be left to decide,&rdquo; Kabogo told a youth meeting in Gatundu South.Six-piece voting requires voters to elect all candidates from a single party, not multiple parties and not independents.Kabogo lost the Jubilee governor primary, which he later called shambolic.The governor said Kenya has come of age and voters for the first time will vote for individuals, not political parties.The Kiambu chief said presidential candidates cannot afford to ignore independent candidates because they can determine winners.&ldquo;If I have 30,000 followers and another independent candidate has 5,000, do you want to tell me they can ignore us?&rdquo; he asked.Kabogo is the chairman of the Kenya Independent Candidates Alliance that has 4,000 members.The governor called on voters to reject propaganda, consider issues and vote for candidates who will deliver economic and social development.&ldquo;Let us not listen to propagandists who are out to tarnish our development record and also lack an agenda,&rdquo; he said.Kabogo urged his opponents to tell voters what they have done for them and what they intend to do, instead of focusing on propaganda.The governor also asked voters to turn up in large numbers to vote for President Uhuru on August 8. He said voter turnout will determine the winner of the election.He called for peaceful campaigning and voting.
