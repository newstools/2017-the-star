The Nyanza ODM presidential campaign team has written to the IEBC demanding investigation on Siaya independent governor aspirant Nicholas Gumbo over violence that marred NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga's Rarieda rally on Sunday.The team, led by Homa Bay woman representative Gladys Wanga and nominated MP Oburu Odinga, wants the IEBC to take a stern action against the Rarieda MP for the chaos that left scores of people injured.Gumbo has, however, rubbished claims linking him to the violence.He said the fracas was stage-managed to portray him as violent.Political rivals distributed his branded t-shirts to hired goons to cause chaos at the function which was to be attended by the NASA leaders, he claimed.&ldquo;We are calling for investigations into the conduct of the said candidate with regard to the elections code of conduct,&rdquo; the NASA letter dated June 27 says.&ldquo;Armed with posters, the youths kept vigil at the scene of the rally waiting for the presidential team to arrive. Hell broke loose when the presidential candidate Raila Odinga got to the podium to address the gathering. The youths began singing praises of Hon Gumbo in addition to displaying his posters, while also throwing stones to the dais.&rdquo;The letter was also copied to Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet.Gumbo is seeking to unseat Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga on an independent ticket after failing to win the ODM ticket during the April nomination.Last week, youths allegedly allied to Gumbo and those supporting ODM nominee Cornel Rasanga engaged each other in running battles at Aram market in Rarieda where Raila was to address a rally.The NASA presidential candidate was forced to end the meeting prematurely after the youths started pelting the gathering with stones.&ldquo;The rally was theirs. I wasn't in attendance. As a matter of fact, I was harvesting maize in my farm at the time. They stage-managed the chaos with known thugs hired from Kisumu. These people are desperate to push their unpopular candidates. They are literally ready to kill for it,&rdquo; Gumbo said.In recent weeks, there have been serious clashes between ODM candidates and Independent candidates in Homa Bay, Migori, Kisumu counties and, recently, Siaya.
