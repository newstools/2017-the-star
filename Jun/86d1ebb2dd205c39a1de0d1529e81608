Diamond Platnumz has revealed that during the time he and his wife Zari Hassan had a public tiff, Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho was one of his concerned pals who called to find out what the issue was.Diamond posted a photo of Zari in the swimming pool as he was being held by another man, whom Diamond did not know and wrote:&ldquo;This is the reason why sometimes I prefer being a player than a committed loyal man&hellip;because these people cannot be trusted."Zari immediately responded to the post with one of her own, clarifying that the man in the swimming pool was his kid's uncle, the cousin to the late Ivan Ssemwanga, adding that he is married.Diamond told a Tanzanian radio station he had a reason to suspect something was amiss and thus posted the photo out of his insecurity and anger. He made a phone call to Zari seeking clarification. "Nilikua nimepanic, kweli!&rdquo; he said.He went on to explain that his fellow WCB crew, where he is the CEO, were disgusted by his Instagram post. "Walinisikia vibaya kwa sababu hawakutegemea mimi naweza nikafanya hivyo. Nilijiskia vibaya ndio maana nikaitoa.&rdquo;The tension caused by his post saw most of his pals call him.He said: "Alinipigia simu mpaka Fally, kanipigia Peter wa P-Square. Tuliongea na yeye kama dakika kumi. Nilipigiwa simu na watu tofauti tofauti wengine kutoka hapa, akanipigia mpaka Joho."
