Kenya will send four athletes to the sixth Youth Commonwealth Games in Nassau, Bahamas due to lack of finances. The four, two from each gender will be accompanied by two officials for the event scheduled for July 18 to 23.The National Olympic Committee of Kenya was forced to cut its planned number of 41 sportsmen (29 boys, 12 girls) and nine officials after the government, through the ministry of Culture, Sport and Arts negated its March 2017 commitment to cater for the team&rsquo;s air fare and allowances.After confirming their support for the Kenyan contingent to the Caribbean country, the government backed out last Friday, claiming that they had committed their entire resources towards the World Youth Athletics Championship which will be hosted in Nairobi next month. The team will, however, get funding from Commonwealth Games Federation.NOC-Kenya secretary general Francis Paul the said this has disrupted their plans and it is not a good show from the government.&ldquo;It is a bad situation that Kenya find themselves in, but we have settled on a small number to represent the country instead of not entering a team completely,&rdquo; said Francis, who confirmed that all logistics for the team are in place and that the NOC is waiting on the CGF to release their grant (for airfare) to Team Kenya.This is not the first time the government walked out on funding a team to the Youth Commonwealth Games. In 2015, cabinet secretary Hassan Wario&rsquo;s office declined to support the team which represented Kenya in the 5th Commonwealth Games held at Apia, Samoa from September 5 to 12. Last time, Lotto Foundation stood in the gap.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know what the ministry is up to when they fail to support our youth team development. It is sad that these are the athletes/ players who are meant to graduate to the senior teams,&rdquo; lamented James Chacha, the deputy secretary general, who was the Chief De Mission for the 2015 YCG.
