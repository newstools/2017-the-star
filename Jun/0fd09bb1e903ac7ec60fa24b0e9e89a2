US President Donald Trump said Thursday on Twitter that he never recorded his discussions with fired FBI Director James Comey, ending weeks of speculation."With all of the recently reported electronic surveillance, intercepts, unmasking and illegal leaking of information, I have no idea whether there are 'tapes' or recordings of my conversations with James Comey, but I did not make, and do not have, any such recordings," the President wrote on Twitter.Trump's admission came minutes after Bloomberg published a story suggesting his widely teased recordings did not exist.Trump's choice of words suggests his initial speculation may have referred to the possibility that an intelligence agency secretly recorded his Comey talks. There is no evidence to support that suggestion, however.White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters minutes after Trump's announcement that "I think the president's statement via Twitter today is extremely clear, and I don't have anything to add beyond the statement itself."Asked if the president records any Oval Office conversations, Sanders replied: "Not that I'm aware of." She gave the same answer to a question about whether Trump ever had recordings and then erased them.She also said she does not believe Trump regrets bluffing about the potential existence of recordings."I think it was pretty clear in that statement that he hoped for his sake' that tapes existed," Sanders added.Asked if Trump raised the prospect of tapes in order to ensure Comey was truthful about their conversations, she said "it was more about raising the question of doubt in general."Trump first raised the idea of a White House recording system last month, in a tweet he sent just three days after firing Comey."James Comey better hope that there are no "tapes" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!" the President tweeted on May 12. Comey testified June 8 before the Senate Intelligence Committee that Trump had pressured him to drop the FBI's investigation into former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and demanded his loyalty.Comey said then that Trump's digital red cape-waving a month earlier had prompted him to leak parts of his notes from those conversations to the press.That in turn led to the appointment of a special counsel to investigate alleged but unsubstantiated ties among Trump, his campaign aides, and agents of the Russian government Comey told senators that he hoped Trump had taped their conversation and would, in turn, release them publicly.
