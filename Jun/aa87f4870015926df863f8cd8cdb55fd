The IEBC&rsquo;s register might still have more than one million dead voters.The electoral agency has been urged to thoroughly clean the register to ensure dead people do not &ldquo;vote&rdquo;.&ldquo;In total, when you take into account the number of people who died between 2012-16, you end up with more than one million, who are potentially in the register of voters,&rdquo; KPMG executive director Josphat Mwaura said.The audit firm has cautioned the IEBC to develop a comprehensive policy on how to erase the deceased persons from the register.&ldquo;The biometric registration should be the primary mechanism for identification of voters during the election, because in the event that this is not applied, there is a likelihood of dead persons participating,&rdquo; Mwaura said.He urged the Department of Civil Registration to provode the commission all death records for thorough verification.Mwaura said there is need for an inter-agency collaboration to ensure the Department of Civil Registration provides a reliable and complete list.The commission has only expunged 11,104 names from the register.&ldquo;Only a small number of them have been expunged in the last five years. The IEBC should obtain a complete and detailed list of death records from the registration department,&rdquo; Mwaura said.The commission promised to iron out the matter and present a clean voter register to ensure that the election is free and fair.
