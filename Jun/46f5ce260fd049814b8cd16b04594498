Nyandarua&rsquo;s Lydia Wanjiku is the latest millionaire in town after pocketing Sh1 million in Lotto&rsquo;s 165th draw.Wanjiku, a cleaner at Nyandarua sub county public health offices, started participating in Lotto draws last August but temporally paused in December due to financial constraints before resuming again this year.&ldquo;I am happy I won this money and I thank God for being faithfulness. The money will help me add to my legacy and that of my late husband Joseph Kariuki, who passed on, leaving me a young family to take care of,&rdquo; offered the 59-year-old Wanjiku. The widowed mother of five had only enjoyed a Sh775 win as her highest amount prior to the windfall and she will need time to decide on an appropriate investment plan.&ldquo;This was unexpected and had I not watched the live broadcast, I would have thought the call a hoax.&rdquo;
