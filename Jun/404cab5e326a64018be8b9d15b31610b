China&rsquo;s construction companies are increasingly looking at opportunities in Kenya, driven by the rising public and private investment in construction and infrastructure projects. About 118 construction firms from China are expected to showcase their products during the forthcoming China Trade Week. This is out of estimated 450 firms expected at the business integration forum.Leading organiser of trade fairs in Dubai and China MIE Events said the China trade week has been fashioned for Kenyan entrepreneurs and the business community to meet, discuss and develop trading and business partnerships with Chinese firms across different sectors. MIE Group International events director Michelle Meyrick said yesterday they expect more Chinese firms to camp in Kenya after the China Trade Week between June 29 and July 1. She added that the last such forum held in 2015 resulted in 15 companies setting up shop in the country, with others setting up agencies. Other interested companies expected at the expo deal in lighting, consumer products, electronics, agriculture and jewellery. In 2016, the value of imports from China grew 5.21 per cent to Sh337.5 billion from Sh320.8 in 2015. China is currently the largest exporter of goods to Kenya. During the year, exports also rose 18.8 per cent to Sh10.1 billion from Sh8.50 billion the previous year. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so much about just China not importing, Kenya generally doesn&rsquo;t do much exports, this could be because the transport cost was high, the exchange rate was high and it doesn&rsquo;t make it financially viable,&rdquo; Meyrick said.The purely business-to-business forum is aimed at tapping into the China Silk Belt Road opportunities where Kenya is expected to receive funding from China to enhance the project.
