I didn&rsquo;t choose my ethnic community,&rdquo; he said.The Jubilee Party candidate spoke on Thursday after being cleared by the IEBC.Read: Tolgos on the spot over plan to sack deputy, secure Keiyo voteSupporters of independent candidate Moses Changwony heckled him. Changwony was endorsed by a section of Keiyo elders who claimed the Marakwet community won nominations for all seats in the county.Tolgos asked "those trying to divide the county on ethnic lines to teach the candidates they are endorsing how to seek votes".He dismissed claims that appointments in his administration were skewed in favour of one community, saying all sub-counties were considered in when executives and chief officers were hired.Tolgos unveiled his running mate Wesley Rotich, whose main duty, he said, will be to ensure youths are empowered.&ldquo;When you elect me in August, I will give Rotich one clear assignment - to ensure the youth start companies and benefit from county tenders. We had to give out tenders meant for them to other counties because they were not empowered."The county boss further said Rotich, 34, who is the county&rsquo;s director of cooperatives, understands the youth issues better.Tolgos added that he will accommodate his opponents in the county government should he be re-elected.Rotich thanked Tolgos for selecting him as his running mate and said he has sufficient experience for the post.He said he drafted a bill that will be effected in July, to enable youths start businesses using funds from the county.Changwony and independent candidate Anthony Chelimo will present their document to IEBC returning officer Moses Sunkuli at 2pm and 3pm respectively.WA IRIA LOW-KEY CLEARANCEMurang'a Governor Mwangi wa Iria was cleared a day after a resident filed a petition in court for him to be barred from the election over integrity issues.Jackson Ndegwa filed his petition on Wednesday saying the Governor does not meet the constitutional threshold to defend his seat.
