Kwale women candidates have united to back each other and ensure they clinch seats in the county assembly and in Parliament. The candidates put their political differences aside and agreed to support each other to face it off with their men competitors. This was after men aspirants joined forces during the party primaries in what was seen as an effort to subdue their women counterparts. During the nominations, women complained of harassment and intimidation by men candidates.On Thursday, women candidates met during a forum organised by Sauti ya Wanawake Pwani at Hill Park Hotel. They said men opponents ganged up against them to ensure women did not win during the nominations. Kwale woman representative candidate on the Party of Development Reforms ticket Fatuma Tabwara said women are no longer enemies of their own. &ldquo;We are working together to ensure women get to leadership after the August election. We will ensure the Kwale assembly gets a majority of women, unlike before,&rdquo; she said. Tiwi MCA aspirant Furaha Sheba said most of their competitors are men, who still don&rsquo;t believe women can be good leaders. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m facing off seven men in my ward and they use women to fight women,&rdquo; she said. ODM nominated MP and candidate for woman representative Zuleikha Juma said, &ldquo;Let us focus on our aim of winning the election and going to the county assembly and Parliament.&rdquo;
