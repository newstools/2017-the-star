Nairobi residents can now breathe a sigh of relief after the county&rsquo;s doctors called off a go-slow, just two days after they boycotted work over unpaid salaries and delayed promotions.The medics protested against the county government&rsquo;s move to deny them salaries for the 100 days they were on strike, from December 5 last year to March 14.Yesterday, Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists&rsquo; Union Nairobi branch secretary Thuranira Kaugiria said the county has agreed to pay the arrears.&ldquo;We held a meeting with the county officials and they agreed to pay the money. So we have no business being on the streets,&rdquo; Kaugiria said on the phone.But addressing journalists at City Hall yesterday, Governor Evans Kidero said the county is willing to pay the arrears, which amounts to Sh48 million, on humanitarian grounds.&ldquo;We cannot pay for work not done for the 100 days because if we do so, then it will be charity. But we are willing to sit with them and make exgratia payment on humanitarian grounds,&rdquo; he said.The doctors staged protests outside City Hall on Tuesday and Wednesday, demanding their pay, accusing the county of mistreating them.On Tuesday, Kaugiria said some doctors have not been paid since December, and doctors due for promotion have not been promoted, eight months since the union signed a deal with the county government.&ldquo;They have not actualised anything since we signed an agreement in November last year. Our correspondence with the governor and county secretary has yielded no fruit. So we are going to protest every day until our grievances are addressed,&rdquo; he said.But Kidero denied claims some medics have not been paid since December. He said the only payment the county has not made was for the three months doctors boycotted work.On the nurses&rsquo; strike, Kidero said the county stopped the payment of the negotiated allowances after being advised by the Salaries and Remuneration Commission.&ldquo;There was a huge discrepancy in pay between the nurses under the defunct City council and the national government. That is why the SRC advised us to stop the payments until payments are harmonised,&rdquo; he said.Doctors signed an agreement and called off their strike in March when it hit 100 days.Health CS Cleopa Mailu, PS Nichola Muraguri, immediate former Council of Governors chairman Peter Munya and KMPDU secretary general Ouma Oluga signed the deal.&ldquo;By doing so, we bring to an end the painful struggle that we have been through,&rdquo; Oluga said during a press briefing in March.&ldquo;Patients and doctors cannot be separated. The strike is over but we need to restore industrial harmony.&rdquo;The health workers agreed to return to work and were to get new allowances backdated to January 1, 2017.
