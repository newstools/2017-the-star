The Kwale governor&rsquo;s press office was on Thursday night broken into and Sh 2 million goods stolen.The thief made away with among other things two laptops, two video cameras and a TV set dueing the 2am break-in.Police recovered all the stolen items after a driver of a Mombasa-bound matatu drove into a police station after he became suspicious of the suspect who boarded the vehicle in Kwale town at 4am.On realising what was happening, the suspect drew out a dagger and threatened to attack the driver.The suspect jumped out of the vehicle and fled, and abandoned the stolen items.Police believe this was an inside job, since the thief seemingly used a master key to open the door. It was not, however, immediately clear if the suspect was alone or with others. Interestingly, the theft occurred despite two guards being on duty and AP officers guarding the adjacent National Treasury offices. Matuga police boss Michael Mwaura said some county workers may have colluded with the suspect.
