Nyashinski took the Kenyan music industry by storm after releasing two singles, Malaika and Aminia, the same day. He literally just pulled a Beyonce on us. He worked with Cedo, who produced the two songs.During an interview with Word Is, Nyashinski revealed how he keeps the different sides of him alive.He said: &ldquo;I never let one side die. I just don&rsquo;t rap all the time or sing all the time, but I take so much risk to try and express myself. And I&rsquo;m setting the trend for the next generation to also take the risk for them to express themselves in different ways. In my mind, when I think about which direction my music is going, I think of the old and the young people.&rdquo;He said he has no favourite song of his, as he loves all of them the same.When asked if his songs come from a personal experience, he said: &ldquo;Yes. I try to write songs that I have gone through because I know people will directly relate with someone else. So I don&rsquo;t do my songs just for the sake of writing but they come from a real place.&rdquo;Speaking about the making of the two songs, he said: &ldquo;Malaika took two vocal recording sessions. If you stretch it, maybe four days. But for Aminia, it was pretty quick, like for a day,&rdquo; Nyash said.
