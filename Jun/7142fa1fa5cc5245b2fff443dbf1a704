In a move aimed at curbing the rising cases of doping, Athletics Kenya and Anti-Doping Agency of Kenya in collaboration with world&rsquo;s governing body, IAAF, have drafted mandatory requirements for athletes ahead of the June 23-24 World Championship Trials.According to the rules, athletes seeking to feature in the trials must have attained qualification time. They must also comply with IAAF Anti-Doping regulations, and undergo two tests in competition (major events&mdash;excluding those by IAAF) and three tests out of competition. Athletes, who intend to take part in the national trials and go on to represent the country at the I World Championships in London will also have to meet the set IAAF standards in regard to doping.The athletics governing body in conjunction with Adak maintained that any athlete, whether based at home or abroad, will not make the cut to the national trials if they fail to meet the set rules for the same.AK president Jackson Tuwei said all interested athletes will be required to meet all the qualifications if they hope to get the nod for the national trials and the world championships. &ldquo;It will be mandatory for athletes to meet all the qualifications before making to the trials,&rdquo; Tuwei said. &ldquo;I call upon athletes to attend the doping seminars in order to understand more about Anti-doping,&rdquo; he warned.He said the seminars, which will be run by Adak, will create awareness on a number of doping issues ahead of the trials and they are a must-attend for all runners.Before August, qualified candidates will be required to sign a letter of commitment to confirm they have met all conditions.The AK boss said athletes ready for the national trials will and must be registered with the association. He warned that non-members will not be invited for the trials.&ldquo;All athletes, who wish to take part in the trials from all over the country and beyond must be registered with AK. Athletes, who do not meet the conditions will not be invited for the trials,&rdquo; he quipped.He said the exercise will not target everyone but only the top runners. He said they are targeting 105 runners, whom they have invited individually through coaches and managers.He said Adak is liaising with foreign-based athletes through the respective National Anti-Doping Agency of the countries they are based.He said they would rather send a very small team to the World Championships than take chances. &ldquo;Remember we are still on the IAAF watch list and therefore we cannot afford to go against these measures,&rdquo; he noted.
