Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya on Tuesday took his campaigns to his main rival and Wiper candidate Chirau Mwakwere’s doorstep. He launched projects and warned Mwakwere against tainting his name during his campaigns.Mvurya told Mwakwere to show what he has done for residents. “Let Mwakwere tell you what he did for you when you gave him a chance to represent you for 10 years and then compare that with what I have done for the four the years I have been in office,” he said, addressing supporters in Baraza Park in Kwale town. Mvurya opened a drug store and administration block at Kwale Level 4 Hospital in Matuga constituency which cost Sh39.4 million. He said plans are underway to improve facilities at the hospital. “What we have done today attests to my pragmatic leadership and I commit to do more in the health sector if reelected so that our people do not have to travel to Coast Provincial General Hospital in Mombasa,” Mvurya said. He said Mwakwere had nothing to offer residents. “You are eying my seat to achieve your selfish desires. We know who you really are,” Mvurya said.
