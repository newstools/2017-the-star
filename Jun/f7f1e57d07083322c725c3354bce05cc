Murang&rsquo;a woman representative Sabina Chege has dismissed claims President Uhuru Kenyatta visited the area empty handed.There has been an outcry amongst residents that the President has neglected the county, which is considered a Jubilee stronghold.Residents took to social media after Wednesday&rsquo;s visit by Uhuru, questioning why they did not get any perks from the tour.&ldquo;When he goes to Kisii he gives them Sh800 million, when he goes to Kiambu he gives them 1,800 title deeds, but when he comes to Murang&rsquo;a he comes empty handed,&rdquo; one social media user said.Chege has said Murang&rsquo;a residents should instead be grateful that the government has initiated numerous infrastructural projects.The MP said the Jubilee government has initiated projects worth billions of shillings, especially in water and roads.&ldquo;Murang&rsquo;a has received one of the biggest budgets from the national government countrywide and has received water projects worth Sh10 billion, while roads worth Sh17 billion are under construction,&rdquo; Chege said.She said leaders thought the President would have more time to interact with residents and explain his government&rsquo;s achievements in the county.Chege said the President was unable to visit all shopping centres as outlined in his itinerary, and was therefore forced to rush the visit.&ldquo;We all know the President had to sign some bills in State House on Wednesday morning before proceeding to Murang&rsquo;a. That is why his schedule got squeezed,&rdquo; she said.Residents have raised concerns that Jubilee is taking their support for granted and has been wooing other areas instead.Chege, however, said Uhuru is passionate about Murang&rsquo;a county and appreciates the solid support he receives from the residents. &ldquo;We are happy that the President visited our county and we look forward to a second visit,&rdquo; she added.The President said his administration is committed to ensuring majority of Murang&rsquo;a residents are connected to water for irrigation and domestic use.
