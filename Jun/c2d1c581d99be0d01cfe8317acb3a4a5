Presidential hopeful Solomon Gichira wants IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati held for contempt of court and committed to civil jail.Gichira says the commission rejected his nomination papers and failed to decide within 36 hours as had been directed by the court on June 16.He wants the court to summon Chebukati to show cause why he should not be cited for contempt and committed to civil jail. Gichira says he presented his nomination papers on June 19 to IEBC officers and they acknowledged that all but one of his documents were okay.Gichira says the IEBC officials told him the signatures of the supporters he had submitted had not met the threshold. They then rejected his nomination as a presidential candidate.He said the decision taken by the IEBC was done hastily and without any regard to the rules of natural justice. Gichira said, &ldquo;The IEBC is the sole custodian of the voter register its officers purportedly used to verify my supporters.&rdquo;He said having already been found as having treated him unfairly, it is absolutely imperative that the decision be verified through a production of the submitted signatures and the voter register to determine the accuracy of IEBC&rsquo;s stand. The presidential aspirant said the decision to reject his application had already been determined before he presented himself before the polls agency.The information furnished by the commission in explaining its decision to dismiss the application was scant and questionable and called for the court to verify it, Gichira says.He further adds that it is in the public domain that the 2017 voter register contains significant inaccuracies as revealed by the audit conducted by KPMG.Errors included 4,209 missing voter applications from 19 constituencies, and, as a result, public confidence in the voter register is very low, the hopeful said.&ldquo;The schedule furnished to me does not accurately indicate the supporters who are legally eligible to vote and a decision based on an inaccurate voter register cannot be a valid decision,&rdquo; Gichira says.He notes that he will be denied his constitutional right to vie for the presidency should the court not order a verification of the IEBC&rsquo;s unfair and biased decision to reject his nomination. Gichira was charged with attempted suicide after he allegedly tried to jump off Anniversary Towers after the commission rejected his nomination papers. He denied the charges.
