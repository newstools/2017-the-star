Elgeyo Marakwet governor Alex Tolgos was on Saturday forced to cut short his speech at Chepkorio after crowds shouted in support of Independent candidate Moses Changwony. President Uhuru Kenyatta who was present during the rally watched helplessly as Tolgos was forced to invite Changwony to address the Jubilee campaign meeting. The President, who alongside his deputy William Ruto have called on various independent candidates to back winners, did not comment on the drama when he stood to speak. He however asked locals to back the Jubilee party at the August 8 elections.
