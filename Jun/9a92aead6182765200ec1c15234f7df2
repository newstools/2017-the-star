Bungoma woman representative Reginalda Wanyonyi has told NASA the county is no longer its zone.Speaking in Webuye on Wednesday, she said the presumption that Bungoma will vote for the opposition is wishful thinking as the election results will prove.Wanyonyi said Bungoma voters are proud of Jubilee for having fulfilled its promise to them and they will reciprocate by giving them a second term in office.&ldquo;Pan Paper is up and running again, after about 10 years, roads that were forgotten have been tarmacked, a fully fledged university has been established and medical equipment is in our hospitals. Who cannot see these?&rdquo; she said.The county has at least 400, 000 votes out of 1.9 million registered in the four counties in the former Western province. It is the home of Ford Kenya leader and NASA co-principal Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula. He is Bungoma senator. In 2013, the county shared votes between the now-defunct UDF and New Ford-K, then headed by NASA co-principal and ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and Water CS Eugene Wamalwa. Ford Kenya and ODM got one seat each.
