Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero has accused his political rivals of backing criminal gangs and extortionist rackets.Kidero said the city has had an upsurge in organised crime. He blamed his competitors for the city&rsquo;s top job for links with the criminals reportedly terrorising Kayole and Komarock. In the race for Nairobi, Kidero will face Jubilee Party&rsquo;s Mike Sonko and Peter Kenneth, an independent candidate. &ldquo;There is an emergence of more organised criminals who are extorting cash from matatu crews and I believe they have the backing of some politicians in the city,&rdquo; he said. The city chief said the menace has spread to other slums where the gangs demand protection money from traders. Speaking during a meeting with the Kenya Alliance of Resident Associations, he said the gangs resurface before elections.
