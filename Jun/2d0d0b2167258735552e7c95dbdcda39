Kenyans online are asking, just how old is screen siren Betty Kyallo? In a recent interview with KU TV, the KTN news anchor talked about her experience after she was involved in car accident that let her half her face scarred.&ldquo;It happened in 2003 I was in form 3. You can imagine you are 17 years and you loose half of your face. It was really devastating. I was in hospital for about two and a half months. I went through seven surgeries because my ribs and jaw were broken.&rdquo;However, in a past social media post, Betty narrated how "on the 6th of August 2005, ( a day like today) I nearly lost my life after being hit by a matatu in the CBD. I sustained serious injuries having broken my jaw, collar bone, 4 ribs, punctured my lungs, broke my left leg and worst of all scarred my face and neck. That matatu was clearly meant to kill me. I stayed in hospital for 2 months and underwent 8 corrective surgeries. I learnt how to walk again like a child and had to deal with the scars which was the hardest thing as a teenage girl. My dreams were crushed, lost my self esteem, pitied myself and cried every night. However because of God's grace, love and mercy I pulled through. I am still here and I'm grateful for life."So, how old is Betty?
