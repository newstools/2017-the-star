President Uhuru Kenyatta Tuesday continued his onslaught on NASA and called for issue-based campaigns.He urged Kenyans to ignore NASA because it has nothing new to offer Kenyans.&ldquo;They are always criticising everything we do. They criticised the standard gauge railway, but, last week, we launched it and we&rsquo;ve already secured money to extend it. It will pass here in Kisii to Kisumu,&rdquo; Uhuru said during a rally at Masimba High School.&ldquo;They have a right to contest elections, but let them tell Kenyans what they want to do for them because Kenyans are smart people &mdash; they are not for divisive politics, propaganda and insults. We don&rsquo;t want to go back to the 2007-08 violence.&rdquo;He said he deserves to be reelected based on his development record. The President cited roads, energy and healthcare, &ldquo;as some of the areas, where my administration has done well&rdquo;.&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve built roads, connected more than three million Kenyans to electricity and mothers who deliver in hospitals don&rsquo;t pay for it. We pay exam fees for candidates and if you reelect us, secondary school education will be free.&rdquo;Uhuru criticised NASA leaders for claiming that Mumias Sugar legal officer secretary Ronald Lubya was killed by government during their campaigns in Machakos town on Monday.Lubya was shot dead at his home on Sunday night.NASA leaders blamed the government for the killing, claiming the secretary refused to bow to pressure to sign a deal for illegal sugar importation.
