Nurses and ministry officials met on Thursday for a day-long meeting, but the strike was not resolved.Union deputy secretary general Maurice Opetu said the meeting was led by Health PS Julius Korir (pictured) at Afya House.&ldquo;We had a fruitful meeting and we reiterated that we can&rsquo;t call off the strike until we sign the collective bargaining agreement,&rdquo; he said.The 26,000-member union is demanding higher salaries and promotion of nurses. The union recommended that nurses be considered for managerial positions in areas that nursing expertise was required.Opetu said the nurses were not given the right opportunities in matters of promotion. &ldquo;A nurse can only rise to job group T and even if he furthers his education, they are not considered for other jobs and are not paid according to his academic qualification,&rdquo; Opetu said.The disputed CBA made nurses go on strike that has entered Day 19 on Friday.Opetu has reaffirmed the strike will persist until the county governments heed their demands of signing and registering the CBA.&ldquo;Nurses are taken for granted and even in terms of promotion, doctors are preferred to take positions that nurses could take even where the matter is purely a nursing agenda such as maternal health,&rdquo; Opetu said.The Collective Bargaining Agreement was expected to be effected on July 1 and was to remain in force for a period of four years.
