Blocking Hassan Joho from attending a government function in his county is totally unacceptable, NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga has said. The Mombasa Governor had demanded an explanation for an extra Sh100 billion cost for the project and promised to stop the launch if answers were not given. Reports indicated security officials kept him off the venue and that he was seen arguing with GSU officers at the Miritini gate while the ceremony went on at Port Reitz.

"It is very unfortunate that a Kenyan should be barred from attending the project, since its Kenyans who are going to use the railway," he said. "Joho is a Governor and this project is being launched at his own country. He should be the one to welcome the President." On Tuesday, the President told Joho to back off Jubilee projects and focus on his mandate as county boss. Uhuru asked the Governor to concentrate on justifying his re-election to residents but Joho accused him of "oiling the wheels of corruption at the expense of service delivery". The fiery Governor was also barred from the Mtongwe ferry services relaunch in March. He was surrounded by heavily armed police officers in Nyali bridge amid allegations that Uhuru ordered his arrest.

But he warned Uhuru against using it to gain support for the August 8 general election. "We in ODM and NASA welcome the project and don't oppose it. But he should not use the railway as a tool for campaigns," he said. But Raila added that the government only completed an idea they came up with during the grand coalition government. "We were the ones who negotiated with the Chinese government. It has only been completed under Jubilee's watch. Let them launch it as a national project," he said. The ODM leader backed Uhuru on punishing people who vandalise SGR and any other other infrastructure saying the law must be respected. SGR vandals will be hanged to death if the President implements a warning he issued while launching the services. A section of the new line was damaged by unknown people in Mariakani. Pictures showed a gap in a section of the guardrail, an incident that resulted in claims of sabotage. Engineers scurried to carry out repairs before the launch and the four suspects who were later arrested will be charged with organised crime, DPP Keriako Tobiko said.
