Piloting of a new proposed education system will start this morning in 470 select schools across the country.This comes after more than 2,000 teachers completed the second phase of training of the 2-6-3-3 education system. It will replace the 8-4-4 system that has been in place since 1985. The 8-4-4 system was criticised for being exam-oriented.More than 30,000 learners in the early years of pre-unit up to standard three are targeted for the piloting of the curriculum that will end this academic year. The roll-out of the new curriculum is part of education reforms that aim to see learners examined through continuous assessment, as opposed to a single national examination.&ldquo;The system will focus on other students&rsquo; abilities and not just drilling them to pass exams,&rdquo; Peter Kega, Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development team leader for Turkana and West Pokot counties, told teachers during training at Nasokol Girls&rsquo; High School.Kega said Special Needs Education is also anchored in the Basic Education Framework to cater for the needs of children with physical, hearing and visual impairment.A report prepared after the classroom sessions will be used to improve the process to ensure it reflects the country&rsquo;s national educational needs, he said.Phase one of the training was on the basic foundations of the curriculum to help selected teachers familiarise others with the new system. The second phase involves having teachers taken through the technical aspects of the curriculum.Julius Jwan, the KICD director, said the training was successful and that more teachers have shown interest in the proposed curriculum. &ldquo;The third phase will be an ongoing programme that will entail online preparation of materials for the teachers to familiarise themselves with the content. We shall also introduce platforms for information sharing,&rdquo; Jwan said.&ldquo;We have officers from each of the counties participating in the training. We don&rsquo;t want to leave anyone behind in this process because different experiences will finally give us a better idea.&rdquo;Jwan said already, curriculum developers from the KICD and Ministry of Education are in the counties to monitor the rollout and onward implementation of the pilot curriculum.
