Mombasa Wiper governor candidate Hassan Omar has said his administration will unite all religions in the county to ensure peaceful co-existence. He said he will ensure peace prevails among Muslims, Christians and Hindus, among  other religions. “As we move towards the end of Ramadhan, I urge you people of Mombasa to promote religious and social cohesion so that Mombasa becomes one community,” Omar said. He spoke during his Grand Annual Iftar on Wednesday evening in the Burhani Sports grounds. The Mombasa senator took a swipe at religious leaders who openly campaign for politicians. He called them sycophants. Omar said religious leaders should promote peace and cohesion. “I want this sheikh to be accepted during political periods and other times. Our religious leaders have a duty to lead the masses to be better people. “It is not possible to be a religious leader while you are a sycophant who leads people astray,” Omar said. He said peaceful polls starts with peace messages from religious leaders. “I go to non-Muslim’s houses and invite the non-Muslims to my house so as to negate the stereotype that Islam is a violent religion, non-tolerant and hateful of other religions,” Omar said. Being sycophants, he noted, only gives a sense that a person supports one side and not the other, which sows seeds of discord from the members of the other divide that feels left out. “I don’t want to invite a Sheikh to my function and people say he is my campaigner and supporter. I want a sheikh to love me because of my diligence and ideals,” Omar said. He said religious pulpits should not be used for political purposes because the clergy will lose respect.
