The Embu assembly passed key legislation despite bitter rivalry between MCAs and Governor Martin Wambora, speaker Kariuki Mate (pictured) has said.This is despite two no confidence votes and efforts to impeach Wambora. He was accused of abuse of office and violating the procurement Act. The Senate endorsed MCAs&rsquo; motion to impeach the governor, but the court quashed the decision.Mate spoke on Thursday during the assembly&rsquo;s last sitting since the ward representatives were sworn in four-a-half-years ago. He delivered his last address to the House as MCAs adjourned indefinitely to allow them to campaign for the August 8 General Election.Kariuki said it is important for the electorate to know they delivered during their tenure as MCAs, and provided a legal framework for the county executives to implement development projects.&ldquo;I urge ward reps to let the electorate know that the relationship between the executive and the legislatures across the world results in political attrition due to the oversight role and checking of excess powers,&rdquo; Mate said.He observed that whereas some governors have suffered setbacks due to lack of commitment by their assemby members, Wambora&rsquo;s work was never sabotaged by MCAs. Mate said members stood the test of time by consistently executing their mandate despite fights with Wambora.He said they should never regret the impeachment motions against Wambora if they did it for the good of the people.
