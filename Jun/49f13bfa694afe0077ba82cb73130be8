There is widespread anger against the Jubilee administration in Western, leaders and analysts say.They said the administration has mistreated and ignored the residents.Likuyani MP Enoch Kibunguchy said Jubilee sidelined the vote-rich region for voting for the opposition in 2013 and in so doing unified it in the opposition.&ldquo;You have seen President Uhuru Kenyatta dish out more than Sh800 million to integrated IDPs in Kisii and Nyamira, but in Western he asks people to embrace peace, despite there being integrated IDPs as well,&rdquo; he said.Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto visited Western last week to woo voters.The DP was in Western on Wednesday and the President on Thursday. They returned to the region on Sunday and Uhuru is scheduled to tour again this weekend.Missed chance to woo voters&ldquo;Jubilee Party missed an opportunity to endear itself to the region when the merger of affiliate parties came a cropper,&rdquo; political scientist Amukowa Anangwe said.&ldquo;Instead, they preferred to kill the affiliate parties from the region, including New Ford Kenya and UDF, but failed to turn the Jubilee Party into a juggernaut and a fitting substitute in the region.&rdquo;He said Ruto chose to gallivant in Western in an &ldquo;ad hoc manner&rdquo; and with no clear sense of purpose on what needed to be done, particularly on perceived acts of omission and commission of the government since 2013.Anangwe said the Jubilee administration did not explain what it would do differently if reelected.This, he said, has left a perception that a second term in office for Jubilee would be business as usual, characterised by exclusion and rampant grand corruption.Message of hope&ldquo;There is collective anger against the status quo, current economic situation and how the Jubilee government has generally conducted public affairs that matter most to Kenyans, especially youth unemployment, inflation, corruption, ethnicity and poverty,&rdquo; the analyst added.Anangwe said Luhya voters will assess which political formation offers the better opportunity for change in terms of policies and political behaviour of those in government between Jubilee and NASA.Political analyst Martin Oloo said Jubilee must find what is relevant to the people of Western.&ldquo;They must bring to the people a message of hope that will build confidence in the people to trust them with a second term,&rdquo; he said.Oloo said voting will not take place on the basis of projects but other dynamics that affect the people directly.
