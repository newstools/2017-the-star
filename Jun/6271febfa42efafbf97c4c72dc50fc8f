The Kenya Wildlife Service, Kenya Forest Service and Kenya Prisons Service will assist the National Police Service in maintaining law and order during and after the August 8 General Election.The multi-agency team led by Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet will be deployed countrywide.Boinnet said they are engaging all county commanders to iron out contingency plans on how to deal with emergencies and the resources required to make the process successful.&ldquo;There is coordination among all national security agencies and we have set up a multi-agency team to address specific threats to security,&rdquo; he said during the National Election Conference.In January, President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s administration commissioned 500 assorted police vehicles to enhance security.The initiative, which is the government&rsquo;s third phase of the police vehicle leasing programme, is meant to adequately prepare the National Police Service for the forthcoming polls.President Uhuru urged the security team to deal firmly with anyone who incites violence, regardless of nationality or political affiliation.He said that in 2013, NPS had only 3,155 vehicles but his administration added 1,200, 1,000 and 500 vehicles in the first, second and third phases of the leasing programme, respectively.
