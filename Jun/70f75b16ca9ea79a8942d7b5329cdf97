NASA Nairobi leaders (pictured) yesterday hit out at President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto over the recent &ldquo;attacks&rdquo; on their flagbearer Raila Odinga. Governor Evans Kidero, ODM woman representative candidate Esther Passaris and senator hopeful Edwin Sifuna asked the Jubilee leaders to stop using the opposition leader as their campaign agenda. &ldquo;We launched our manifesto on Saturday, grounded on social justice, elimination of illiteracy, ill-health, poverty and bad leadership. Why don&rsquo;t you tell us what your agenda for Kenyans will be?&rdquo; Kidero said.Passaris accused the government of attempting to awaken the ghost of 2007-08 post-election violence by trying to whip up tribal emotions. Sifuna asked Uhuru to own up to his failures and stop using the NASA leader as a scapegoat to justify his failures. &ldquo;Respect is two-way. We are asking the President to lead by example. He must show respect to the opposition leader. We are not going to expect a peaceful election, where you keep on insulting our leaders,&rdquo; he said. They addressed journalists after attending service at Riruta PCEA.
