State-owned power producer, KenGen, is seeking firms to develop its proposed industrial park at Olkaria, Naivasha. This follows completion of plans to set up the eco-friendly park targeting large industries, largely textile and apparel industry. The firms will enjoy competitively-priced geothermal steam and electricity thus enhancing operational efficiencies. KenGen supply chain director Phillip Yego said in an Expression of Interest (EoI) notice yesterday that the listed firm has earmarked 453 hectares for the development of the park. The property will provide industrial, commercial and recreational facilities.“The development will be through partnerships with private developers under an appropriate commercial structure. We shall be the project sponsor and we seek to procure an appropriate partnership with a private entity that shall undertake on-site infrastructure development for the proposed industrial park,” Yego said.
