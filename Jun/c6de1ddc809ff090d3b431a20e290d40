Jubilee Party is using ethnic division to gain ground at the Coast, Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi has claimed.Kingi made the allegation on Wednesday, saying President Uhuru Kenyatta's supporters are now wooing voters based on tribal affiliations.&ldquo;JP politicians are trying to use divisive politics to poison our minds so that they can gain ground. They know the party cannot be embraced in the region...that is why they want to come and preach the issue of tribal affiliations to retain power,&rdquo; he said.He spoke in Shimo la Tewa ward on Wednesday after meeting leaders from several communities in the region.It was reported that Jubilee candidate Suleiman Shahbal's strategy for becoming Mombasa governor entails getting the endorsements of all communities and winning youths over.For the past two weeks, Shahbal has been meeting members of several ethnic groups, who have endorsed his candidature. He has met Luhyas, Kambas, the Maasai and Kaya elders.More on this: How Suleiman Shahbal plans to beat Joho in Mombasa raceKingi urged leaders to embrace cohesion for peace to prevail.He said the country needs to remain united at this time and that all politicians should sell their agenda without touching on tribes.&ldquo;If they want to be elected, let them come and explain what they have done for the people of Kilifi. All residents of Kilifi belong here," he said."They should not come here and pretend to be speaking to their people. They should talk to everyone in Kilifi, not just people from particular tribes."The Governor further noted Kenyans need leaders capable of uniting the country and ending tribalism.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want tribal masters whose only goal is winning elections because they have the backing of their tribe. If this is the case it will be hard for us to grow as a united nation,&rdquo; he said.Kingi campaigned for NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga saying he is only one who can unite Kenyans.&ldquo;I will always advocate for a Raila presidency because he is the only candidate who can draw support from all corners of the country. He doesn&rsquo;t need to be voted in only in Nyanza in order to be president."Read: Joho's plan to lead Raila-Kalonzo Nyanza campaigns is ridiculous - OmarThe county chief was with Senator Stewart Madzayo and Shimo la Tewa ward representative ODM candidate Sammy Ndago.Madzayo asked residents to vote for leaders who will not discriminate against any citizens.Noting the government has isolated some regions in development, he said only NASA has the cure for the injustices Coast residents have faced.
