Kenyans will today know the National Super Alliance Pentagon leaders' key agenda for the country when they unveil their manifesto as the race for State House with rival Jubilee Party intensifies.NASA Presidential Committee Secretariat yesterday confirmed to Star that the event will take place from 5pm to 9pm at Ngong Racecourse, Waterfront Grounds in Nairobi, just 41 days to the August 8 General Election."We expect more than 700 people, including but not limited to the diplomatic corps, business and political leaders and professional associations. All coalition parties have targeted special interest groups such as the youth, women and persons with disability," NASA secretariat presidential campaign director Kathleen Openda said.She refused to disclose the manifesto's theme and its key pillars until the official launch, but a source said the document's contents are under "lock and key" to avoid any leakage to rival Jubilee."We were to be given copies of the manifesto today (yesterday) morning by the presidential campaign secretariat to prepare in advance but then told on Sunday evening to wait until Tuesday morning. "There was fear Jubilee could copy some details of our manifesto and pledge to Kenyans in their closing remarks," a source from Ford Kenya said. Star had earlier on been told the manifesto titled 'Reclaiming Our Country: Deconstructing the Past and Constructing the Future' is based on the five-party Coalition Agreement under two crucial Articles. Article Four is on leadership values such as zero tolerance to corruption, equality and equity in representation and sharing resources. Article Five dwells on national unity to resolve historical injustices and poverty and unemployment, among other challenges.NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga, his running mate Kalonzo Musyoka and co-principals Musalia Mudavadi (ANC), Moses Wetang'ula (Ford Kenya) and Governor Isaac Rutto (CCM) will preside over the event. Total free secondary education starting September this year and lowering the cost of living and food prices within 100 days have been Raila's key pledges to Kenyans if NASA wins the polls.Both Jubilee and NASA have been locking horns on providing free secondary education, with each camp claiming it is the sole owner of the idea. President Uhuru Kenyatta's JP is promising to roll out the programme in January next year.
