National secondary school netball defending champions Kaya Tiwi fell 26-31 to arch-rivals Obambo in a repeat of last year&rsquo;s final at the ongoing Term 2A games in Mombasa. Otieno Achieng was Obambo&rsquo;s best scorer with 23 goals in 32 attempts, supported by Margret Obiero (8) while Melda Ogunda (21) and Margret Awino (4) were Kaya Tiwi&rsquo;s top scorers. St. Dorcas thrashed Moi Girls from North Eastern 82-1 with Marion Atieno bagging 61 goals in 94 attempts as Pheny Awuor added 21 while Moi Girls sole score came from Adow Shamsa, who had two attempts.

St. Dorcas, who are making a debut at the national level believe the win will inspire them to cause even more upsets going forward.
