The negotiated CBA was presided over by officials from the county under SRC guidelines so all we are waiting for is signing and registration," Opetu said on Monday, when the union held a protest in Nairobi."Without this nurses will not go back to work."The union has also disapproved calls for medical interns to assist patients in hospitals.&ldquo;It is illegal and wrong for medical interns to work without guidance or supervision by a qualified nurse,&rdquo; Opetu said.The CBA was to be signed on March 2. Its contents include allowances of Sh15,400 (risk), Sh5,000 (extraneous), Sh5,000 (responsibility) and Sh50,000 (uniform) per year.Speaking to the Star, the KNUN secretary general for Machakos expressed appreciation for Cotu's support.&ldquo;We are asking for a very little increment...less than that of teachers...but they have already received their money so the SRC narrative does to add up,&rdquo; Halima Adan said.In Kakamega the 1,300 striking nurses were asked to resume duty or be sacked.In a notice served to all nurses and heads of health facilities, county health executive Penina Mukabane suspended all annual leaves and ordered nurses who were on leave before the strike to report to work immediately.In Bomet nurses have warned Governor Isaac Rutto and some health officials against issuing threats to sack them for participating in anationwide strike.Read: Nurses issued sack notice as strike enters second week
