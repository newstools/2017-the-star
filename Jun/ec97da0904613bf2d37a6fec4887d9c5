The international response to the appeal for Kenya drought funds has been slow.Food and Agriculture Organization representative in Kenya Gabriel Rugalema said on Friday this is because Kenya is considered a low priority, compared with Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen.He said out of the Sh2.5 billion ($25 million) appealed by the UN food agency, only about Sh362 million ($3.5 million) has been achieved so far. &ldquo;I know every UN agency has faced the same challenge,&rdquo; Rugalema said.Kenya Red Cross Society secretary general Abbas Gullet said out of the Sh2.7 billion ( 25 million Swiss Francs) appeal, only 50 per cent of the pledges have been honoured.He said interventions are still necessary.&ldquo;It is clear that we will be working for the next nine months. As in 2011, we may transition into El Ni&ntilde;o, which means moving from one emergency situation to another. Floods will be expected in some parts of the country, when the heavy rains finally fall,&rdquo; Gullet said.&ldquo;We need to be prepared so the country is not caught by surprise by the approximately five-year drought followed by flooding cycle.&rdquo;He spoke in Nairobi and signed a Sh71 million MoU with FAO to support pastoralists in Samburu, Marsabit, Mandera, Garissa, Tana River and Turkana counties. The funds go to livestock purchase, animal feed distribution and animal health services. Implementation starts immediately and runs until October as the drought continues to affect these counties and family livelihoods, Rugalema said.The fund will provide feed to 1,210 beneficiaries, destock 13,224 animals, benefit 6,769 households with cash, support 7,507 households with meat fortwo months and procure 10 tonnes drought tolerant fodder seed.
