Embu Governor Martin Wambora (pictured) and county assembly speaker Justus Mate shared a table and tea on Tuesday after a year of cold war. Wambora and Mate&rsquo;s enmity started a few months after they both took office.The county assembly passed a vote of no confidence in Wambora twice before the Senate impeached him. The governor had gruelling court battles to save his seat and sued Mate and county assembly clerk Jim Kauma. The High Court and Court of Appeal reinstated him.Since then, the three have hardly met. The last time they met was in Nairobi in June last year to deliberate on the county&rsquo;s budget, following a stalemate between the assembly and the executive.But on Tuesday, the three were forced by circumstances to meet and temporarily bury the hatchet when China&rsquo;s Jiangsu Provincial People&rsquo;s Congress (JPPC) standing committee vice chairman Zhao Peng paid a courtesy call on the governor.
