It is almost a month now since the government introduced the Sh90 subsidised maize flour, but most Thika residents are yet to see it.A spot check in supermarkets in Thika Town on Wednesday revealed the flour is available in the morning before 11 am. Customers are not allowed to pick more than two packets.But some crafty customers have devised a way of buying as much maize meal as their pockets can allow. Some of them ask their relatives, as many as five, to accompany them to a supermarket, where each one of them picks two packets. This causes the stock to run out fast, making the flour unavailable to a majority of households.Although the flour is supposed to be available during morning hours, it is therefore not guaranteed that all customers seeking the meal will get it.Some customers keep returning to a supermarket for more unga, as many as three times. Others are colluding with supermarket attendants who alert them when a new stcok arrives. In return, they reward the employees with airtime and money, among other goodies. Some customers have combined forces and are buying directly from the millers.
