Muhoroni residents on Saturday took to the streets protesting against the candidature of former MP Ayiecho Olweny.They vowed not to vote for any other candidate apart from the incumbent Onyango K'Oyoo.Chanting "No K'Oyoo! No Voting", the residents said they voted for the MP during the ODM nominations and that their choice must be respected.They said leadership is for the people noting that any attempt to impose a candidate on them will be met with the full rejection it deserves.The residents accused Prof Olweny of presiding over a poor development track record for the two terms he served as the MP."We are tired of his leadership where youths were being misused to attack people with crude weapons," Abdala Otieno, a resident, said.Otieno said Olweny failed miserably during his tenure and asked ODM leadership not to force his candidature down their throat.He said party leader Raila Odinga should swiftly intervene on the standoff which is likely to cause voter apathy in the constituency.Margaret Aoko said praised K'Oyoo for good leadership and governance which has seen tremendous development for the past four years."Our children are blessed to go to schools unlike under the previous leadership. Roads are passable and less fortunate children have also benefited."The protest follows the High Court ruling that stripped K'Oyoo his nomination for the seat and declared Ayiecho ODM nominee.On Wednesday, Justice Lessit ruled that "the court tabulated the result and established that Olweny had won the primaries by garnering 23,578 votes while the incumbent managed 13, 700 votes."The Judge cancelled nomination certificate forwarded to IEBC and directed ODM to issue the certificate to Olweny.Lessit ordered ODM to issue Olweny with a nomination certificate then forward his name to IEBC as its valid candidate for MP seat.Further, she reprimanded the ODM&rsquo;s election board chair Judith Pareno for contempt.This was after she failed to tabulate the results of primaries in five wards which forms Muhoroni constituency.Read: Court orders ODM to give Ayiecho Olweny Muhoroni MP ticketEarlier, Lessit had set aside a ruling by the Political Parties Tribunal upholding K'Oyoo's win.Olweny had filed an appeal after he was dissatisfied with the tribunal's findings.He lodged a complaint at the tribunal saying that voting did not take place in five wards.The don said the returning officer had gone missing, therefore, the results could not be declared.The tribunal ruled that Olweny's complaints lacked merit and dismissed it.K'Oyoo had been declared the winner with 18,669 votes, while Olweny got 6,648 votes.In the 2013 polls, K'Oyoo was denied the ODM ticket and opted for People's Democratic Party (PDP) and won the seat.At that time, Prof Olweny was handed the certificate but lost.
