The government is preparing to tarmac the Vanga-Lunga Lunga road in Kwale county and will take six months to complete the road instead of the stipulated one year, Roads PS John Musonik has said.President Uhuru Kenyatta launched the road last month.The work will cost taxpayers more than Sh65 million.On Saturday, when Musonik toured the area, he asked the contractor to hasten the road upgrade.&ldquo;It is a three-kilometre project with an additional 68km and the next section's contract will be awarded in the next two weeks for the work to be continuous,&rdquo; he added.The government is doing 250km tarmac road in Kwale county, which will be completed in five years, the PS said.The roads include the 51km Samburu-Kinango road, a two-year project.He said the ministry will also tarmac the Kinango-Kwale and Lunga Lunga-Kinango roads to act as alternative routes for people travelling to Nairobi, to avoid congested Mombasa roads and ferry delays.&ldquo;I want to assure Kwale people that Jubilee has started close to 100km already of tarmacking road, which is ongoing in Kwale,&rdquo; Musonik said.He was with Lunga Lunga MP Khatib Mwashetani, who said the tarmacking of the Vanga-LungaLunga road is critical for the county that borders Tanzania.&ldquo;We have been given 75km tarmac road for Lunga Lunga. We want before we go to election 2km to be ready,&rdquo; the MP added.Mwashetani told voters not to elect him if the road is not tarmacked.&ldquo;That is why we say we are in Jubilee government,&rdquo; he said.The legislator slammed Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho for claiming President Uhuru Kenyatta visited Kwale only to launch a murram road. He said the road is being tarmacked.&ldquo;Joho should focus on his county, which has a lot of potholes,&rdquo; he said.
