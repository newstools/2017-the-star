Although he has been in Manchester City for seven years, Yaya Toure does not quite know the city's language.The Ivory Coast international star was tasked at decoding some of the city's most famous slang words in a hilarious video.In a post on the club's official YouTube channel, Toure reads out the words then puts them in context in a sentence.But it is hilarious how each new Manc words he comes across perplexes the 34-year-old.He wears a confused expression as he reads 'buzzin': "I'm proper buzzin for next season mate."When asked what he thought the word 'chuddy' meant he replied: "To be honest, I don't know."The midfielder seemed to have a headache when asked to read the word 'kecks' and tried to work out what it meant.Other words that also blew Toure's mind were 'mint' and the phrase 'our kid.'As he tried his hardest to work out what these new words meant he rubbed his head.At some point he protested saying, "This is quite difficult."After he got a total of zero out of a possible nine Toure was asked if he would be using any of his new words in day to day life.He replied: "I don't think so. Or maybe bobbins."
