Secondary school principals will be forced to cut the number of days for the annual meeting of teachers over poor attendance, their employer, the TSC, has said.Every year, principals meet in Mombasa for their annual conference.This year, more than 8,000 principals were expected to attend the 42nd Kenya Secondary School Heads&rsquo; Association annual conference between June 19 and 23.The turnout was impressive during the first three days - Monday to Wednesday. But on Thursday and Friday, the attendance declined drastically, and TSC chief executive officer Nancy Macharia was not amused. &ldquo;Every year, we allow the head association five days for the annual conference. They tell us a certain number of you will be in Mombasa from this date to this date. But where are the rest of you?&rdquo; posed Macharia.She said this is an issue of integrity. &ldquo;This morning I tried to call several schools to find out if their principals are around. I was told they are in Mombasa, but I cannot see them here. Where are they?&rdquo; Macharia said.She said Kessha will be forced to reduce the number of conference days from five to two. She said she will not be taken to task on behalf of teachers. &ldquo;If you say you will be here for five days, you must be here for those five days,&rdquo; Macharia said. She said she was surprised the hall remained half empty for the last two days and the Kessha chair could not explain where his members were.Macharia wanted the principals to accept to reduce the conference days from five to two, but they refused in unison. She said she will meet Kessha chair Indimuli Kahi to discuss the issue before the next conference. &ldquo;Next year, you will have to advise us to either allow you two days or one day... We cannot allow this kind of show,&rdquo; Macharia said.
