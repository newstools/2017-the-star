ODM leader Raila Odinga&rsquo;s wife Ida has appealed to losers in the party nominations to support the NASA presidential candidate, and stop holding grudges.

Idah said campaigns have reached a critical stage, and continuing infighting might hurt the opposition leader&rsquo;s presidential bid in the August 8 polls. &ldquo;Politics is a game of democracy where we must have winners and losers. I am asking our brothers and sisters who missed the opportunity to clinch the ODM tickets to let go of their bitterness,&rdquo; Ida said.She spoke in Kisumu during the consecration ceremony of Voice of Salvation and Healing church Archbishop Winnie Owiti on Saturday. Ida urged residents to turn up in large numbers and vote for Raila, saying the winner will be determined by the number of people who will cast the ballot.She called for peace before, during and after the election. Kisumu Governor Jack Ranguma, who attended the function, promised he will mobilise voters to support Raila.
