MPs have just seven sitting days to debate and pass far-reaching pieces of legislation before Parliament officially adjourns for the August 8 polls.The life of the 11th Parliament comes to an end on the night of June 15.But before the lawmakers conclude their calendar in a fortnight, they are racing against time to enact pending bills now at various stages.Some of the crucial bills the House is supposed to pass before adjournment include two key laws meant to unlock funds for both the national government and the counties.MPs must enact the Division of Revenue Bill which spells out the sharing of revenue between the two levels of government.But quorum hitches expected as MPs start campaigns for reelection could throw pending business into disarray and hurt government operations.The initial bill was shot down at the mediation committee level after MPs and Senators failed to agree on Sh29 billion additional funds to the devolved units.The Senate proposed allocation to the counties be increased from Sh323 billion approved by the National Assembly to Sh352 billion, resulting in a standoff.The National Assembly Budget and Appropriations Committee has republished the initial Division of Revenue Bill without adjustments sparking another stalemate.The MPs must pass the crucial Counties Revenue Allocation Bill, which sets out the formula for the sharing of revenue among the 47 county governments. This means the counties&rsquo; operations could grind to a halt should MPs fail to enact the two crucial financial instruments.The county assemblies cannot enact their own appropriations bills before the MPs pass the County Revenue Allocation Bill. Governors have raised concerns that operations at the devolved units may be paralysed from July.
