NASA presidential flagbearer Raila Odinga will garner more than 90 per cent of the Kisii votes, Governor James Ongwae said on Friday. He said Kisii is a NASA zone and they will ensure Raila gets more than Jubilee. Ongwae spoke after IEBC returning officer Robert Namulungu cleared him to defend his seat on an ODM ticket. He was accompanied by Deputy Governor Joash Maangi, nominated Senator Janet Ongâ€™era and former UN-Habitat Ambassador Sam Ongeri. Ongwae will faceoff with Chris Obure (Jubilee), Manson Nyamweya (KNC), Lumumba Nyamberi (Wiper), Charles Bagwasi (Chama Mwangaza Daima), Samuel Nyamao (independent), Boniface Omboto (Maendelo Chap Chap). On Thursday, the commission cleared Obure, Lumumba, Bagwasi, Nyamao and Omboto.
