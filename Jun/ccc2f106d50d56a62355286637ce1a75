Rongo MP Dalmas Otieno has asked Rakwaro Catholic Church to forgive him for the confrontation that happened at the church on April 20, four days to the primaries. &ldquo;What happened in Rakwaro didn&rsquo;t please me. I was in the priest&rsquo;s office when trainees started running away and youths followed them. I was not involved directly,&rdquo; Otieno (pictured) said. Youths attacked ODM returning officers in the melee. Speaking at his home in Kangeso village on Monday, Otieno said officers, who were mostly teachers, were roughed up. The MP is a member of the church. He said he will see how he can work with the church to restore destroyed property. Otieno lost to ODM Rongo MP nominee Paul Abuor, and will run as an independent. &ldquo;I was not satisfied with ODM nominations results. Stealing and corruption marred the process,&rdquo; Otieno said.He urged residents to shun the six-piece voting pattern.
