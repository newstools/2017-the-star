NASA wants the IEBC to explain its strategies to protect against attacks and possible compromise of the new election technology.In a terse letter to IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati, NASA asks the commission to provide answers about precautions it has put in place to, among other things, protect the results transmission.It warned the recent testing falls below the threshold envisioned in the Elections Act.NASA said there has been no live testing, stress testing and remote testing in a real environment of all 45,000 new kits.&ldquo;The testing the commission undertook on June 9 was nothing but a demo and therefore does not in any way satisfy the standards contemplated both under the Act and the attendant regulations,&rdquo; NASA chief exeuctive Norman Magaya, a law lecturer, said.NASA wants to know when the IEBC plans to test, although the law says it should be done 60 days before the polls. There are 47 days to election.In the letter, NASA said IEBC is legally required to undertake systems audit to guarantee data integrity and ensure the technology functions effectively.NASA wants a copy of the systems audit report and a separate report on the audit of the voter register that was recently concluded by KPMG.The opposition asks when the IEBC will make public the register of voters. It should be done 60 days to the polls.
