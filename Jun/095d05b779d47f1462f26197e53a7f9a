Laikipia County will field teams (men and women) in the next year&rsquo;s Kenya Volleyball Federation national league.The development comes after KVF second vice chairman, Kipkemei Sirma, questioned why the county was not represented in the league despite huge talent from the region. Laikipa County hosted a successful 4th leg of KVF cum county tournament at the Nanyuki Stadium over the weekend. The official said the fact that the county drafted eight teams (five men and three women) in the tournament is a sign that they have players, who should potentially be playing in the league.Sirma said: &ldquo;The county has been hosting both league matches and tournaments year in, year out and it is unfortunate that they don&rsquo;t have teams in the league. It is only fair that when we come back here next time the county should have teams featuring in the league.&rdquo;He added: &ldquo;As a federation, we have a working relationship with many counties who in the previous years have had teams in the league and we look forward to having your teams in the league next year. As a federation, ours has been to ensure we have as many teams as possible to promote growth and competition. &rdquo;Laikipia governor, Joshua Irungu, who sponsored the event, said plans are in top gear to have two teams feature in the league.&ldquo;By next year, we will have both volleyball and also football teams. All the logistics are in place and the players who will be part of these teams will still be employees of the county so that at the end of the month they are paid as employees,&rdquo; noted the governor.He added: &ldquo;We have good players here if what they showcased during this event is anything to go by and mine is to see to it that their talent does not go to waste.&rdquo;The county is expected to draw players from Nanyuki Rangers, Nanyuki Warriors, Nanyuki Vision Stars, Administration Police (Laikipia) and Nanyuki United (men) and Laikipia Queens, Nanyuki Starlets and Equator Graciers (women).
