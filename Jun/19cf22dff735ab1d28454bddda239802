The National Gender and Equality Commission has urged the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to ensure the party list submitted by parties on Saturday meets Constitution requirements and the commission&rsquo;s regulations.In a press statement, NGEC chairperson Winfred Lichuma warned that her commission will reject a party list that does not meet the constitutional requirements.On Tuesday last week, IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati also issued a strong warning to parties that if the top nominee will not be a woman, the party list will be rejected.&ldquo;We expect that political parties have fully complied with Article 90 of the Constitution the Elections Act and the recent nominations and party regulations published by the IEBC in submitting names of members who would qualify for nominations in the National Assembly, Senate and County Assemblies to represent special interest groups,&rdquo;Lichuma said.The party list contains names of applicants who have applied to their respective parties to be considered for nomination to either the county assembly, National Assembly or the Senate.Addressing women aspirants at Hotel Intercontinental, Nairobi, the IEBC boss said the party list which is expected to be submitted to the commission by close of Saturday this week must comply with all the available laws.The party lists must generally comply with the Constitution, The Elections Act, 2011 as amended by The Statute Law (Miscellaneous Amendment) Act, 2012, The Elections (Amendment) Act, 2012, The Elections (Amendment) {No 2}, The Political Parties Act, 2011 and any other relevant law as well as the party constitution and the party nomination rules.The regulations the commission wants the political parties to follow say the first four nominees on the list, shall be a person to represent a youth and person with disability and a worker and any other special interest group identified by the party &ndash; one nominee cannot represent more than one special interest.The list must also indicate the special interest that each nominee represents.To meet the gender requirement, the order of the nominees in the party list shall alternate between women and men candidates.In order to meet the requirement on regional diversity, the regulations say not more than two nominees in the party list shall be from the same county.In a scenario where two of the nominees are from the same county, they shall not immediately follow each other on the list.Lichuma told the IEBC to immediately publish all the lists received from political parties to facilitate dispute resolution within the 10 days provided by law, saying after dispute resolution, the commission should gazette the final party list.On special seats, reserved for Special Interests Groups, Lichuma said the seat should only go to the bona fide members.&ldquo;The National Gender and Equality Commission will monitor this process keenly,&rdquo; she said.In the National Assembly there are 12 seats filled through lists: Those people are to &ldquo;represent special interests, including the youth, persons with disabilities and workers&rdquo;, according to the Constitution.In the Senate, 16 seats for women are filled through party lists, plus one man and one woman, representing youth, and one man and one woman, representing persons with disabilities.In every county assembly, there are to be four members of marginalised groups, including persons with disabilities and the youth. These come from party lists. In 2013, in some counties no women were elected for wards. Not a single county had as many as one-third women, so every county assembly had extra women from party lists.
