National Super league outfit, Police coach Charles &lsquo;Korea&rsquo; Omondi is plotting for a top ten finish for the side promoted to the second tier league last year.Korea, a seasoned footballer himself, and whose technical bench boasts of among others player-cum-coach Gabriel &lsquo;Sesa&rsquo; Nduru, said he is looking to add four more players into the side before the second leg resumes in a week&rsquo;s time. &ldquo;We have lately deployed a new system of play and that is why perhaps our performance has not been up to the expected level. Players are trying to adapt to the new style but I believe in the second leg, we are going to see a more cohesive unit capable of finishing in the top 10,&rdquo; Korea said.The tactician said he has added two youthful players to his side as they attempt to achieve their target in this year. &ldquo;We have brought in young players like Wokabi Njoroge who is still a student at Passenga and Robert Onyango from Langata Gremio. I believe the two can help the club,&rdquo; explained Korea.With the outfit predominantly made up of players drawn from the National Police Service, there have been misgivings from civilian who claim that they have been lured by promises of jobs in the forces but afterwards they were ignored. &ldquo;The club knows that football is now a very competitive affair and we have to look at talent first before everything else,&rdquo; he added.
