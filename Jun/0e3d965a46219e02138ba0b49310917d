Ugandan Premier League top scorer Omar Kasumba is among the 13 new signings who were unveiled at Sofapaka yesterday.The Soccer Club Villa striker will be relied upon to provide the goals for Sam Ssibwa&rsquo;s sixth placed outfit after the departure of Moses Dube Odhiambo and Paul Odhiambo.Kasumba will be joined at the club by his compatriots Ali Feni from Uganda Revenue Authority and Rodgers Aloro from Ugandan Army side, Simba.&ldquo;This three players are very experienced and will add a lot of value to the team. Aloro is a young defender who is rated very highly in Ugandan and I believe he will do well at Sofapaka. Feni too has shown with the cranes that he is capable of scoring goals as he did in the Chan team. I am very confident in them as well as all the others we have signed,&rdquo; Ssibwa explained.The Ugandan tactician further said that the determination of the club to compete for honours had necessitated the acquisition of more than a dozen players midway through the season&mdash;something he admitted will perturb those from the outside looking in.&ldquo;I would say our campaign so far is average performance. We want to fight with the big teams like Gor Mahia and Tusker and compete for trophies. It was therefore necessary that we reinforced the squad to give us the necessary experience and depth to challenge on all fronts,&rdquo; he added at the team&rsquo;s training ground at Eastleigh High school.Apart from the Ugandan trio, Sofapaka&rsquo;s resurgence in the transfer market after their sponsorship deal with sports betting firm, Betika continued to be laid bare as highly rated trio of Western Stima left back Wesley Onguso as well as the duo of Thika United&rsquo;s Timothy Ludda and Palos&rsquo; forward Marvin Otinya all chose to join the team that just escaped relegation by the skin of their teeth in the last campaign.&ldquo;Betika continues to support us as evidenced by the signing we have made. It&rsquo;s not easy to negotiate in the transfer market and our sponsors have greatly helped. We hope the players can repay them by winning trophies,&rdquo; said Sofapaka president.Betika general manager, Lucy Muchira reiterated their support for the 2009 champion and said they were immensely pleased and excited to support a truly winning team, noting the improvement of the side since their partnership began early in the year.Other players, who will join Sofapka are Hillary Echesa and Willis Ouma both of Chemelil Sugar; Ricky Onimbo from Wazito, former international Abdullatif Omar from kakamega Homeboyz, Meshack Karani from Bandari and youngsters Hansel Ochieng of Jericho and Vincent Owondo, who has been promoted from the Sofapaka Academy.
