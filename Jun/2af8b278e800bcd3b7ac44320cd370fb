We will strive to ensure the country&rsquo;s economy improves and jobs are created,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;We will also ensure that nursery, primary and secondary education is free.&rdquo;Raila said he will increase the Older Persons Cash Transfer fund from the current Sh2,000 to Sh3,500.&ldquo;We shall retain the chiefs, contrary to claims by Jubilee that we will fire them. Salaries for police will also be increased to stop the culture of &lsquo;kitu kidogo&rsquo; on artificial roadblocks and the arbitrary arrests of chang&rsquo;aa drinkers,&rdquo; he said.Raila said the laptop project, the tarmacking of 10,000km of roads and job creation are some of the Jubilee administration&rsquo;s failed promises. He took issue with the Jubilee administration for taking over the projects he initiated when he was the Prime Minister and Roads minister.In Siagonjo Stadium in Budalang&rsquo;i, Raila said his government will end the arbitrary arrests of Kenyan fishermen in Lake Victoria by Ugandan security officers.&ldquo;I will meet Uganda President Yoweri Museveni to bring to an end the frequent incidents, where Kenyan fishermen are subjected to harassment by the Ugandan police. I will also have the issue of Migingo Island solved,&rdquo; Raila said.He said the island belongs to Kenya.In Funyula Stadium, Raila gave the IEBC 10 days to print the voters register to enable them to plan for the General Election.He said the adopt-a-polling station strategy will ensure all voters turn out to cast their votes and ensure Jubilee does not rig the election.NASA co-principal and Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula said President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s visit to Western was a clear indication his regime is discriminatory. &ldquo;When the President was in Kisii, he gave Sh350 million to the IDPs. He also launched a multi-billion shilling project in Uasin Gishu. In Busia, he only came to inspect the bridge that was started by Raila,&rdquo; he said.
