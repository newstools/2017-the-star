Turkana Governor Josphat Nanok has urged police to arrest gunmen who opened fire during the Madaraka Day fete in Katilu, Turkana South, killing one resident. He said police only provide security to Jubilee leaders. Speaking on Saturday during the burial of Daudi Eduki , who was shot on June 1, Nanok accused police of delay in arresting the culprits. Eduki, 26, was in the crowd listening to President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s speech. &ldquo;This young man was killed during a national celebration. You cannot claim to provide security when children of poor Kenyans are killed and nothing is done. We demand the culprits are brought to book,&rdquo; Nanok said. He cited another Katilia rally attended by NASA principal Raila Odinga and disrupted by gunmen on February 18. &ldquo;This is a worrying trend and as leaders, we are worried it may disrupt the election in August,&rdquo; he said. Turkana South MP ODM candidate Linus Nakiporo claimed the June 1 attack was planned by his rivals to stop him from addressing the people.
