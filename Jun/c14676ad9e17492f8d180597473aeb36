Renowned rumba star Mbilia Bell is set to jet into Kenya for a series of concerts. The Nadina hitmaker is expected in Nairobi on Monday ahead of a weekend-long list of events on her itinerary. The world music mega star's visit is being bankrolled by Meladen Restaurant and Club, where she is set to perform on June 30 for the  57th anniversary of the Congolese Independence Day celebration. Beside this, she will also set the stage on fire at Kisumu Railway in the heartland of Western Kenya, where she enjoys a fanatical following. The organisers of the event told Word Is that during Mbillia Bell's tour, she will "seek to promote peace in Kenya these two months before the general election".
