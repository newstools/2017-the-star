The University of Eastern Africa &ndash; Baraton has shut down all its satellite campuses.Vice Chancellor Philip Maiyo (pictured) said the move was taken following a council meeting. The fate of about 600 students in various campuses across the country and hundreds of non-teaching staff is unknown.The notice was pinned up at the main campus in Nandi county. Students were assured the university would work out a &ldquo;pro-student programme&rdquo; that would guarantee their credits are safe. University corporate affairs manager Ammon Chepkwony confirmed the action, saying it had been prompted by various reasons, among them low enrollments. Baraton had campuses in Nairobi, Kisumu, Eldoret and Kisii towns, with students taking degree and masters courses.
