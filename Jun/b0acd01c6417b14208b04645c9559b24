The long wait and anxiety is finally over after Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho was cleared yesterday by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to defend his seat.He has faced persecution and frustrations he believes are engineered by the government.Nyali MP Hezron Awiti was also cleared. Senator Hassan Omar and Suleiman Shahbal will seek clearance today.For Joho, it was a treacherous journey that saw him arrested and dozens of investigations launched against him.The governor wore a brave face after being presented with the certificate.Jubilee was keen to have him locked out for heavily criticising it.Joho is accused of presenting a forged KCSE certificate to gain admission to the University of Nairobi for a bachelors degree programme despite scoring a D- minus. He has denied the allegation. The grade does not qualify one to pursue a degree unless one does a bridging course.Even as Joho exuded confidence that he will easily retain the seat, his opponent Awiti of Vibrant Democratic Party said his team will roll out a well-oiled campaign to win and restore Mombasa glory.Awiti said the seat is for him to lose.He had been cleared two hours before Joho.&ldquo;The people of Mombasa are yearning for a change. The change is here,&rdquo; he said at the Kenya School of Government, Mombasa.His running mate Hassan Mwamtoa said the county has not realised meaningful development.Joho told a charged crowd he will not campaign for himself because ODM candidates will do that.&ldquo;I will crisscross the country campaigning for NASA and telling people to vote out Jubilee,&rdquo; he said.Joho&rsquo;s deputy, William Kingi, said he&rsquo;s a warrior, while Awiti&rsquo;s running mate Mwamtoa described his potential boss as &ldquo;lethal and will take the system by surprise&rdquo;.Returning officers Wanjiku Kariuki had a rough time for asking for Joho&rsquo;s form four certificate for him to be cleared.There was a standoff which lasted for 10 minutes after Joho refused to produce the certificate, saying it was not a requirement. He finally handed it over.Joho and Awiti urged supporters to maintain peace during campaigns, promising they will respect the will of the people. He asked police to serve everyone equally and stop being agents of Jubilee. Mvita MP Abdulswamad Nassir said Joho will win this election and retain the seat again in 2022.
