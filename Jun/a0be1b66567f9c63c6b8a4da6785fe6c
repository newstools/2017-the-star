A Court of Appeal decision has dealt a blow to lawyers who have for more than a decade been pushing to be exempted from using ETR machines.Although the electronic tax registers have been in use since 2005, lawyers have been enjoying immunity after successfully obtaining a temporary order pending the determination of the appeal.The ETR dispute arose in 2004, when then Finance minister David Mwiraria in the budget proposed to amend the tax law to provide for introduction of the ETR.But lawyers, through their organisation the LSK, argued the regulations were discriminative, contrary to the Advocates Act and would interfere with client-advocate confidentiality.But in a decision rendered by a three-judge bench comprising Erastus Githinji, GBM Kariuki and Sankale ole Kantai on June 16, their arguments were dismissed for lacking merit.&ldquo;Had we found the appeal has merit, we could, nevertheless, have rejected the appeal on the ground of public interest having regard to the detrimental effect an order allowing the appeal would have on the VAT tax administration,&rdquo; the judges said.When the machines were introduced in 2005, LSK went to court seeking an order to have the minister, the KRA and commissioner of domestic taxes barred from implementing the VAT (ETR) Regulations, 2004.The society argued the regulations were contrary to the Advocates Act and the minister had already made a provisional order legalising the use of ETRs before the empowering law was passed.But the suit was dismissed by then High Court judge Joseph Nyamu who held the LSK had made a serious misapprehension of the relevant tax law.Aggrieved by the decision, the LSK appealed in 2006 and obtained a suspension of the High Court judgment, therefore exempting them from using the ETR machines until the appeal is determined.Duirng hearings, the minister denied the regulations have any retrospective effect as the Finance Act 2004, but rather were meant to curb fraudulent purchase documents , deductions or claim for VAT refunds as well as tedious and lengthy exercise carried out by KRA in establishing trader&rsquo;s tax liability.LSK, before the Appeal court said the judge failed to appreciate that the Minister published the Electronic Tax Registers Regulations 2004, yet the Finance Act 2004 which he relied on to make regulations, had not come into force.
