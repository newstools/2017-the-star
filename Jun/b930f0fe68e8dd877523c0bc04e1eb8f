The query over the degree qualification of Wajir governor aspirant Mohamed Mahamud has sparked a war of word among leaders from the county.The Jubilee governor aspirant had been accused of forging academic certificates, but the accuser withdrew the petition and said someone impersonated him.Some MPs yesterday asked security agencies to probe incumbent Ahmed Abudullahi&rsquo;s role in an academic certificates forgery case against Mahamud.The lawmakers included Adan Keynan (Eldas), Mohamed Ibrahim Elmi (Wajir East), Mohamed Elmi (Tarbaj), Ibrahim Saney (Wajir North) and woman representative aspirant Halima Abdille.The leaders alleged that the governor is behind the case in Uganda in which a Kenyan named Abdirahman Abdille sued Mahamud over fake academic certificates.But the county boss, who said he will address a press conference in Nairobi over the claims, said the leaders&rsquo; call to have him probed were diversionary.&ldquo;They want to divert attention from the degree issue surrounding the Jubilee aspirant,&rdquo; he said.Abdille in his affidavit had claimed that Mahamud never graduated from Kampala University with a degree in Business Administration in 2012 as alleged.Abdille is said to have been coerced to withdraw his affidavit.Abdille, who was present during the press conference at a Nairobi hotel, denied that he ever swore an affidavit against Mahamud.&ldquo;My ID number was used but the signature is not mine. That person was an imposter and not me Abdirahman Abdille. It is upon the investigating agencies to establish who the imposter was,&rdquo; he said.Mahamud said, &ldquo;The propaganda was meant to defame me and my candidature and cause political tension and incitement between two clans.&rdquo;The leaders said after the deputy governor deserted the county boss, Abdullahi decided to drive a wedge between the two main clans in the county.Keynan said, &ldquo;We are aware that he asked for Abdille&rsquo;s ID allegedly to have him nominated on the ODM ticket, but ended up using his particulars to forge the affidavit.&rdquo;Keynan, who decamped to Jubilee from ODM, said the governor had no option other than to join the winning team, &ldquo;which has blessings of the voters&rdquo;.&ldquo;We will get him a place in the Jubilee government of Wajir county. It is not too late for him to go back to the people and ask for forgiveness. He has already been deserted and he is alone,&rdquo; he said.
