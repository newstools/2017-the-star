Health services in the Elgeyo Marakwet county may be disrupted from today after nurses vowed to go on strike.The county&rsquo;s Kenya National Union of Nurses secretary Benson Biwott has said they are protesting against the failure by the Council of Governors to sign a renegotiated collective bargaining agreement.He said nurses will instead take to the streets. &ldquo;No nurse in this county will be in any hospital on Monday. We shall be joining other nurses in a nationwide strike,&rdquo; Biwott said. Speaking to journalists in Iten on Saturday, he said governors have been dodging KNUN and taking them in circles since mid-December last year, when a return-to-work formula was signed. &ldquo;We were given a nursing allowance which was paid only in January and then scrapped,&rdquo; Biwott said.
