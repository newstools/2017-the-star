NASA candidate Raila Odinga has always had a hard time with democracy and elections. It is hard to find a single occasion where he accepted the outcome of an electoral process without a fight on the streets or in court. He has always contested when he did not get the result he expected.Perhaps his experience in the former communist Soviet Union, where he was educated behind the Cold War Iron Curtain in the then East Germany, has something to do with it. In the Soviet Union, there was no democracy, no participatory elections and little freedom of thought or action.French novelist and philosopher Andr&eacute; Malraux once said, &ldquo;Communism destroys democracy. Democracy can also destroy communism.&rdquo;Judging by the amount of time Raila spent in communist countries and his closeness to communist regimes, it is clear that the cause and necessity of democracy and participatory politics is not something that was naturally imbued in him, to say the least.Look at his career, first under the tutelage of his father, Jaramogi Odinga &mdash; who fought for closer ties with the Soviet Union and other countries of the Warsaw Pact during his years in government &mdash; and then his own flirtation with socialism; democracy was never a prime interest or ideal in his formative years.In this election, Raila&rsquo;s anti-democratic credentials are once again coming to the fore. For months now, ODM&rsquo;s main manifesto has not been about improving the lives of Kenyans, but about obstructing and delegitimising every aspect of our democracy.He has attacked and sought to undo the Constitution, the bedrock of Kenyan representative democracy; the IEBC, the body charged by the Constitution with overseeing elections, and the Judiciary, one of the necessary checks and balances of a liberal democratic society.While many Kenyans now have ill feeling towards some or all of these institutions, it is almost certainly because of the almost daily attacks against them by Raila and his minions. Mostly, these attacks are unwarranted and without explanation, unless one understands his worldview and strategy.However, most egregious are his attempts to prevent the election from taking place at all.Raila knows full well that if the election does not take place on August 8, then it will create a constitutional crisis and he never loses a good opportunity to take advantage of chaos rather than receiving a mandate through the voting booths.So, Raila is currently amassing all of his resources in trying to prevent the IEBC from doing its work in preparing for the election. First, Raila tried to cancel the ballot paper-printing contract awarded to Al Ghurair of Dubai, on his spurious claims that the firm has close relations with the Kenyatta family. His proof was that the head of Al Ghurair was part of a delegation from Dubai which once met with Kenyan leaders. After being asked by the IEBC for actual proof that there were personal contacts, neither Raila nor ODM was able to provide any.Furthermore, evidence has since come to light that Raila has very close ties with one of the major companies that just lost out on the ballot-printing contract.Raila knows that to cancel the contract this late would certainly mean a delay of the election, and the necessity for a transitional government, which he could infiltrate and co-opt.Now that the attack on the ballot -printing contract is failing, Raila and ODM have now sued the IEBC for having a back-up system for the election, should some of the electronic voting devices fail. With around 40 days left, this new move is merely another barrage in his attack on the electoral process. Duale is the Garissa Township MP and leader of the Majority in the National Assembly
