Suspected Pokot bandits made away with 30 goats and 16 cows in the latest attack in Yatya, Baringo North sub-county on Wednesday.Barketies sub-location chief Jackson Keitany said there were no shooting and that efforts by residents and Kenya Police Reservists to recover the animals belonging to Tugen herder Elijah Kiburet were futile."We followed footsteps to the neighbouring Tiaty sub-county but none of the Pokot residents and chiefs were willing to give reliable information," he told The Star on phone.The chief accused Baringo county leaders of engaging in politics instead of fighting insecurity."The bandits are having a field day knowing it is the campaign season and that no one will bother much," he added.He said in late May, bandits made away with over 200 goats and 40 cows in the area after a fierce gun exchange with KPR and regular police.More on this: KDF officer feared dead after crossfire with bandits in BaringoLEARNING PARALYSEDOwing to the insecurity, learning has been paralysed for more than 4,000 pupils including some 300 KCPE candidates. Many have been forced to stay in camps for the internally displaced in Baringo North.Resident Richard Chepchomei said the pupils were among more than 10,000 bandit attack victims currently living in temporary camps in Sibilo, Rondinin, Kapkomon, Chapin and Yataya.He said although police reservists have been assigned to man the schools, lack of teachers is proving to be a challenge."Teachers have fled the volatile areas fearing for their lives. We reported the matter to the Teachers Service Commission and the Education ministry [but] no action has been taken&rdquo; he said.Chepchomei said class eight pupils fear they will perform poorly in this year's KCPE if nothing is done about insecurity in the area."How can an untaught pupil compete with a regularly taught schoolmate in the final exam?" he asked.Some 30,000 people have been displaced from Baringo North and South subcounties, which the government gazetted in March as "disturbed zones".Some of the affected schools in Baringo North include Ngaratuko, Chemoe, Yatya, Tuluk, Kagir, Loruk, Chepkesin, Kapturo, Toboroi, Barsuswo and Lokorotabim.In Baringo South, learning has been interrupted in Ramacha, Karma,Katilimwo, Kapndsum, Chemorongion, Embosos, Arabal, Chebinyiny, Sosionte, Nyimbei, Kasiela, Keon, Tuiyotich, Lamaiwe, Karne and Kabel, Rugus, Noosukro and Siarata.Read: Hostile crowds, bandit attack overshadow Jubilee rallies in Marakwet
