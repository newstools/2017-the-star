President Uhuru Kenyatta on Saturday maintained that he has no problem with independent candidates from the Central region.Speaking in a political rally in Meru, Uhuru said he will however only campaign for himself and those seeking various seats on a jubilee party ticket."Hata wale ninao shindana na wao, Mimi sina chuki na wao. Mimi roho yangu haina chuki na wao kwa sababu chuki haipeleki mtu pahali"."Mimi nikiwa hapa kama kiongozi wa jubilee na nikijiombea Kura na wana jubilee wenzangu nasema pia wale wengine wanao tafita kura sina ubaya nao maana pia hao ni wetu. Nyinyi watu wa Meru ndio mtaamua," Uhuru said.This loosely means, " Those we are competing with I have no problem with them. My heart has no hate for them because hatred cannot take me anywhere. As the jubilee party leader as I ask for your votes and on behalf of those seeking various positions I want to let you know have no problem with them because they are also our people. It is only you the Meru people who will decide".Uhuru further urged the youth across the country to shun from activities that might trigger violence ahead of the August polls."Do not accept to be triggers of violence. Let no politician trick you to involve yourselves in violent activities because in any violence no politician will loose an eye, a hand or a leg," he said.Uhuru further dismissed claims that after the opposition brigade visited some parts in Meru county, the region had ditched the ruling party and thrown their weight behind the opposition coalition."Yule Mtu wa vitendawili anasema eti Meru imeingia NASA, hio ni kweli?, hapa kuna mtu wa Nasa?," he paused.Uhuru said the government had invested alot of money to boast Miraa farming in the county and thus was time to pay back by voting for Jubilee regime.We have done a lot for Miraa farmers and we intend to do much more, give us an opportunity to accomplish what we started, he said.
