Public Service CS Sicily Kariuki yesterday took a swipe at the opposition for its relentless attacks on the government over youth projects.She said the leaders have been propagating &ldquo;empty rhetoric and spreading propaganda&rdquo; the programme has not assisted the youth and women in the country.Kariuki said her ministry has rolled out the programme in all regions, not just Jubilee strongholds &ldquo;as portrayed by NASA&rdquo;. She said the Jubilee administration serves all Kenyans, regardless of whether they voted for it or not.Kariuki spoke when she launched the Narok West empowerment programme at Mulot trading centre.The CS was accompanied by Narok Governor Samuel Tunai, his deputy Everlyne Aruasa, MPs Gideon Konchellah (Kilgoris) and Mathias Robi (Kuria West).&ldquo;For your information, since we started the programme, more than 140,000 youths have been engaged and Sh5.5 billion paid to them,&rdquo; Kariuki said. She wondered why the opposition leaders criticise the programme, &ldquo;yet they were in the grand coalition government and failed in the Kazi Kwa Vijana programme&rdquo;.&ldquo;That programme only benefitted old men, while the young people who were working were walking home empty handed. They are unhappy with the programme and have now resorted to propaganda to mislead Kenyans,&rdquo; Kariuki said.She said the programme has helped youths form 400 saccos and invested Sh1.7 billion. Kariuki said President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s administration is proactive.
