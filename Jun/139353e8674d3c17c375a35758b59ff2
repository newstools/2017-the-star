The mother of a 15-year-old boy in Msambweni has appealed to well-wishers for help to enable him join high school. Marita Kwamboka told the Star on the phone she does not have money to pay schools fees for Salim Adengo who scored 328 marks in the 2016 KCPE exam.He attended Bongwe Gombato Primary School. Kwamboka said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to do so that my child, who looks depressed after all my effort to get him to school failed, can go to school. Sometimes he threaten to take his own life.&rdquo; She said she has sought assistance from the Bongwe Gombato ward, Ukunda ward and Msambweni constituency offices in vain.&ldquo;I have gone to their offices for help, but they tell me to first take my child to school if I need financial assistance. The problem is, I don't have money to do so,&rdquo; Kwamboka said.Efforts to reach Education executive Mangale Chiforomodo were unsuccessful as his phone was switched off.Bongwe MCA Omar Boga promised to meet Kwamboka and listen to her problem.
