World Cross Country champion Irene Cheptai succumbed to former holder Agnes Jebet Tirop in the women&rsquo;s 10,000m final as the World Championships trialsgot underway yesterday at Nyayo StadiumIt was sweet revenge for Tirop, who lost to her training partner Cheptai during the World Cross Country Championships in Uganda three months ago in Kampala, Uganda.Just half of the sixteen invited athletes turned up for the 25 lap race. So high was the pace that after the opening five laps, Emily Chapkurui, Mary Wananu and Dorica Kerubo cracked and started trailing.Africa 10,000m champion Alice Aprot tried to pull off but she was countered by veteran Veronica Nyaruai, Tirop and Cheptai as battl;e for tickets shaped up. Nyaruai was the first casualty of the high pace, falling off the leading pack with seven laps left and Aprot followed suit leaving Tirop and Cheptai to call the shots.Evidently confident, Tirop led into the final lap with Cheptai a step behind. At this point, there was no way out for Cheptai as Tirop won the race in 31:56.0. Cheptai placed second in 31:56.4 while Aprot clocked 32:16.7to place third.&ldquo;It was sweet revenge for me to beat Cheptai after she toppled me at the world cross country. I train with her and I have sort of mastered her tactics. I have known all along that I can beat her and I will strive to keep my form up for the rest of the season,&rdquo; Tirop said in a post race interview. In the men 5000m final, Cyrus Rutto won the race in 13:31.05 with youngster Davies Kiplangat (13:31.7) and Josephat Kiprono (13:33.09) following in that order.Kiprono benefited from Geoffrey Koech&rsquo;s disqualification after finishing 3rd in 13:33.09.
