An 84-year-old governor aspirant in Murang&rsquo;a has stepped down from the race to campaign for the Jubilee Party candidate.Jerad Kabugi announced his decision at the IEBC offices on Friday where he had gone to get clearance.Kabugi who hails from Gatanga constituency said it was his lifelong dream to lead the people of Murang&rsquo;a and to provide better services.The man unsuccessfully vied for Gatanga MP seat in 1992 and 1997.&ldquo;This time round, I thought that I should give a try to the governor seat but now I have changed my mind and decided to just support the party,&rdquo; Kabugi said.Kabugi was vying as an independent candidate."I had met all the requirements but thought that it was more important to lobby for the Jubilee government&rsquo;s re-election rather than my own votes", he said.The elderly politician is a retired civil servant.&ldquo;I retired in 1987 from the Ministry of Agriculture where I was working as a district agricultural officer in Samburu after which I worked as a World Bank consultant,&rdquo; he added.His symbol was a table which he said signified transparency.He said his vision was to connect all homes to clean drinking and irrigation water to encourage agribusiness and the county&rsquo;s food security.&ldquo;All our water is now syphoned to Nairobi while our people are still fetching water from rivers,&rdquo; said the octogenarian.Read: Jamleck Kamau bows out of Murang'a governor race to campaign for Uhuru
