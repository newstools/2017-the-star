Jubilee Party Mombasa governor candidate Suleiman Shahbal and his running mate Anania Mwaboza have said they will set aside Sh1 billion every year, throughout their term, to settle squatters if elected. There are about 300,000 squatters in Mombasa county spread across different constituencies, including Kisauni, Likoni, Jomvu, Changamwe and Nyali. Mwaboza last Sunday said he will push for the formation of a Mombasa County Squatter Land Trust throughan Act in the county assembly. &ldquo;We plan to form a board which will enable us as the county government to set aside funds in the county budget to buy land in dispute and settle the squatters,&rdquo; he said. Mwaboza spoke in Nguu Tatu, Kisauni, where the squatter problem led to the shooting of Mohamed Wanje, 31, in January, as squatters clashed with youths hired to evict them. Shahbal said, &ldquo;We have a wellplanned manifesto that will ensure we get the solution to land problems.&rdquo; He continued, &ldquo;The opposition has been in power and had the Lands docket, but failed to help you. Uhuru has been able to issue titles for squatters in Mombasa.&rdquo; Mwaboza, who was installed as a Mijikenda elder, said he will champion the rights of the community. Most of them are squatters. During his installation, Mwaboza was taken through a number of rituals to &lsquo;protect him from enemies&rsquo;. Shahbal and Mwaboza said they will allocate each of the 30 wards Sh50 million every year and a committee comprising residents will prioritise their issues. &ldquo;That will be under the Maendeleo Mashinani initiative. That is not rocket science,&rdquo; Shahbal said. Mwaboza said he will use his experience as the Kisauni MP to solve land disputes and the squatter problem in Mwembe Legeza, Mwakirunge and Ziwa la Ng&rsquo;ombe.
