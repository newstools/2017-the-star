The High Court has directed Jubilee Party to hold fresh nominations for Budalang'i MP in three days.Justice Jessie Lesiit invalidated the May 26 decision by the Political Parties Dispute Tribunal that cancelled Alfred Maloba's nomination in favour of Mediatrice Wangira.The party led by President Uhuru Kenyatta is now required to conduct fresh primaries and comply with its constitution and election laws. &ldquo;The party appears to be confused by issuing double nomination certificates to two candidates to represent them for the same seat," Lesiit said on Tuesday."That is irregular. Further, it is the party which is the custodian of the nomination exercise results. It ought to sort out its mess through its internal disputes resolution mechanism."More on this: Will the real JP Budalang&rsquo;i MP nominee stand up?Also read: It's only in Jubilee where losers get tickets, dejected Budalang'i MP aspirant saysMaloba garnered 5,569 votes against Wangira&rsquo;s 5,489 in the hotly-contested primaries conducted on April 26. He was duly issued with the nomination certificate dated May 9 but later learnt that the party had not forwarded his name for clearance by the IEBC.The aggrieved candidate, who was represented by lawyer Robert Asembo, had petitioned the court to compel Jubilee to issue him with the nomination certificate. But he was shocked to learn that Wangira had filed a complaint with the tribunal.Several Jubilee officials who supervised the exercise had confirmed Maloba won and was properly declared the winner. &ldquo;It is difficult to understand, from this record, the basis upon which the PPDT decided who should have the nomination certificate for Budalang&rsquo;i," noted Lesiit."It is the duty of the party to nominate its representative at the national elections. It cannot be determined by the PPDT especially where the results of the nomination exercise were not even before the tribunal."
