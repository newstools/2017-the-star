Workers of a macadamia factory in Embu  on Monday  boycotted work, protesting against failure by the management to pay them their three-month salary. The employees of Limbua Kithungururu Macadamia factory, Embu North subcounty, held a demo in the afternoon chanting anti-management songs. Most of the staff said their houses have been locked by their landlords for failing to pay rent. “For the last three months, the factory’s management has been lying to us that they would pay us our dues, but the pledges have been empty,” said a staff who did not want to be named for fear of reprisal . Area MCA  Ibrahim Swale met the workers and promised he would follow up the matter with their bosses. Embu county is the biggest producer of macadamia nuts in Kenya.
