Athletics Kenya (AK) have invited over 200 athletes for next week&rsquo;s national trials ahead of IAAF World athletics Championships set for between August 4 and 13 in London.AK president Jack Tuwei said the invitees are those who have hit the qualifying time with a few who are yet to, but have the potential to do so.All the country&rsquo;s medalists from the 2015 edition in Beijing two years ago, will be on parade at Nyayo Stadium, save for marathoner Helah Kiprop who is training with the rest of the marathoners in Nandi County.By virtue of being the defending champions, gold medalists from Beijing Vivian Cheruiyot (10,000m) Ezekiel Kemboi (3000m steeplechase), Nicholas Bett (400m), David Rudisha (800m) Julius Yego (Javelin throw), Hyvin Kiyeng (3000m steeplechase) and Asbel Kiprop (1500m) have a direct ticket to defend their titles.However, Tuwei said they will consult the IAAF on the status of Diamond League winners including Ferguson Rotich (800m), Conseslus Kipruto (3000m steeplechase), who is also the Olympic champion and Kiprop (1,500m).If their status returns positive, then Kenya could have a chance to field five athletes in the men&rsquo;s 800m and 3000m steeplechase as well as four in the men&rsquo;s 1500m. Tuwei said the top three athletes in each event will gain automatic qualification to London.World silver medallists Geoffrey Kamworor (10,000m), Kipruto (3000m steeplechase), Faith Kipyegon (1500m), Caleb Mwangangi (5000m), Elijah Manangoi (1500m) and bronze medal winners Paul Tanui (10,000m), Brimin Kipruto (3000 S/C) and Eunice Sum (800m) have also made it to their respective start-lists.World youth 800m champion Kipyegon Bett and silver medallist Willy Tarbei and former world junior champion Alfred Kipketer join Rudisha and Ferguson in what is expected to be a jaw-dropping 800m straight final.Sum, a former world champion, headlines the 800m final alongside Margaret Nyairera and evergreen duo of Prisons&rsquo; Sylvia Chesebe and National Police Service&rsquo;s Emily Cherotich.Kipyegon, who is also the Olympic champion, will battle it out with the likes of United States of America-based Viola Lagat, Winfred Mbithe, Selah Jepleting and Winnie Chebet, who has upgraded from the 800m.The men&rsquo;s three-lap race also reads like &lsquo;who is who&rsquo; as Kiprop and Manangoi battle against former Commonwealth champion Silas Kiplagat, Commonwealth silver medallist Ronald Kwemoi, national champion Timothy Cheruiyot and Diamond League regular Bethwell Birgen.Olympic 5,000m champion Cheruiyot headlines the 10,000m alongside fourth finisher at the Rio Olympics and national champion Alice Aprot, world 21km record holder Joyciline Jepkosgei, Beatrice Mutai, Betsy Saina and Sheila Chepkurui.Olympic silver medallist over the distance Paul Tanui headlines both the 5000m and 10,000m start-lists alongside world 10km and 15km record holder Leonard Komon, world cross and world half marathon champion Geofrey Kamworor, world half silver medallist and third place finisher at the London Marathon Bedan Karoki, Mathew Kisorio, Leonard Barsoton and youngster Rodgers Kwemoi.However, Tuwei remained tight-lipped on whether athletes will be allowed to double up in London, insisting this is a decision to be informed by the advise of the technical department.Hellen Obiri, the Olympic silver medallist and world leader over 5,000m battles former world cross champion Agnes Jebet, world cross champion Irene Cheptai, Nancy Nzisa, Caroline Chepkoech, Lilian Kasait, Shaila Chepkirui and Commonwealth Youth champion Sheila Chelagat.The men&rsquo;s water and barrier race will see Olympic champion Kipruto and world champion Ezekiel Kemboi come face to face for fourth time in a major championship with Jairus Birech, former Olympic champion Brimin Kiruto, former Olympic bronze medallist Abel Mutai and youngster Amos Kirui adding to the flavour. Kiyeng, world junior record holder Celliphine Chepteek, former Commonwealth champion Purity Cherotich and Marion Kibor are in the hunt for a slot in the women&rsquo;s divisionGrace Wanjiru, Samuel Gathimba and Simon Wachira could have a direct entry for the London Games in the walk races while Julius Yego leads the field events line up.Bett (400m/H), Boniface Mucheru (400m/H) Maureen Jelagat (400m, 400m hurdles) and Alphas Kishoyian (400m) headline the sprints alongside Mike Mokamba (200m), Mark Otieno (100m, 200m), Ferdinard Omanyala (100m, 200m), Maxmila Imali (100m) and Damaris Akoth (100m, 200m).
