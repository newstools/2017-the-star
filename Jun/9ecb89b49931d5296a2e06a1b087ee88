Jubilee&rsquo;s attempts to reintroduce the collapsed ICC cases are &ldquo;the last kicks of a dying horse&rdquo;, Western leaders have said.Vihiga Senator George Khaniri yesterday said Jubilee will fail in its attempt to reignite the sympathy narrative that the opposition plotted their prosecution &mdash; to whip up ethnic emotions and tilt the vote.The cases collapsed for lack of evidence.Kenyans now know the truth and won&rsquo;t be hoodwinked by Jubilee propaganda, he said. &ldquo;We as the opposition are going to revisit the National Assembly Hansard and publish the names of those who voted for the Kenyan cases to be referred to the ICC,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;It is Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto who led the anti-local tribunal onslaught in Parliament because they thought it was President Mwai Kibaki&rsquo;s and Raila Odinga&rsquo;s names in the Waki envelope. They should quietly carry their own cross.&rdquo;DP Ruto on Monday said NASA had negotiated with the ICC to restart the cases and have him and Uhuru jailed.The ICC has not said it plans to reopen the cases if the opposition wins. ICC senior trial lawyer Anton Steynberg did say the court could consider reviving the cases under a sympathetic administration.On Sunday, National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale said Steynberg&rsquo;s words show the ICC is not about justice but a hidden agenda.However, Khaniri said, &ldquo;They [Jubilee] are trying to use the tired narrative to whip up ethnic emotions to attract sympathy and divert attention from real issues. &ldquo;Let them address serious issues NASA is raising, including corruption scandals, high cost of living and excessive borrowing,&rdquo; he said.Likuyani MP Enock Kibunguchy said the ICC is &ldquo;a dead and buried horse&rdquo; and urged Jubilee to find something new as that story won&rsquo;t work in August. &ldquo;This is like trying to reopen old wounds because people lost lives and property, and may not want to be reminded because no one compensated them,&rdquo; he saidLugari MP Ayub Savula said Jubilee and NASA should keep off the ICC issues because they are emotive, and could trigger another round of ethnic animosity during the polls.&ldquo;We know there are those who could be praying that another round of political turmoil occurs so that they can take revenge,&rdquo; he said.Savula reiterated politicians should be bonded by a court to keep peace before, during and after polls.
