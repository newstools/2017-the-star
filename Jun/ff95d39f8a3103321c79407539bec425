Deputy President William Ruto yesterday said opposition leaders have no moral standing to fight corruption because they are literally owned by graft cartels.Ruto said Opposition leaders are being financed by graft and Non-Governmental Organizations accountable to no one.&ldquo;Their entire campaign is paid for by corrupt cartels with money stolen from Kenyans,&rdquo; Ruto said. &ldquo;How will you fight corruption when the choppers you are using and your entire secretariat are paid for by corruption cartels? Tell your story to the birds.&rdquo;NASA says the same of Jubilee being cozy with cartels.Ruto was speaking in the company of President Uhuru Kenyatta in Kirinyaga county.A picture published on Monday by the Daily Nation shows Raila using a helicopter, 5Y JWJ, owned by businessman Jimmy Wanjigi. It is not clear if that photo is what Ruto was referring to.Last night NASA dismissed Ruto&rsquo;s accusations, saying they had a duty &ldquo;to save Kenya from this kind of leadership&rdquo;.&ldquo;Our beloved country cannot afford to play this kind of politics, especially when basic commodities like unga are both hard to find and afford in a system that only benefits the few.&rdquo;NASA must save Kenya from this kind of leadership in the next 40 days,&rdquo; director of communications Kathleen Openda told the Star. The election is on August 8.Wanjigi has not publicly responded to the Nation story, which said on Page One, &ldquo;NASA has opened its arms to Kenya&rsquo;s most feared man.&rdquo;However, his lawyer Ahmednasir Abdullahi dismissed the article on &ldquo;state capture&rdquo;.&ldquo;Pitifully @dailynation is engaging in paid for diversionary games. The election is btw Nasa and Jubilee. Mr Wanjigi isn&rsquo;t running for office,&rdquo; he tweeted.President Kenyatta said the opposition has failed miserably as they are unable to articulate their own agenda.&ldquo;Yesterday, I got surprised. I thought they were bringing a new plan but frankly, as we have seen, they have no plan,&rdquo; Kenyatta said in Kirinyaga.He told Kenyans to vote for leaders who focus on development, not spreading propaganda and falsehoods without giving alternative solutions.&ldquo;It is now clear thatthose in opposition have no agenda for this country and should therefore be ignored at the ballot,&rdquo; Kenyatta said.He asked why opposition leaders were demanding withdrawal of Kenya Defense Forces in Somalia, although they had been in the government that approved and their mission there.&ldquo;Those in opposition were&nbsp; in the Cabinet that approved the KDF peacekeeping mission in Somalia during the last regime. My brother Ruto and I were not part of that Cabinet. Now they are demanding them back. This is strange,&rdquo; he said.The President further promised his administration will provide internships for all students graduating from government universities and technical institutes.On food security, Uhuru said he will be in Kirinyaga in the next two weeks two launch the mega Sh17-20 billion Thiba dam project, which he said will double rice production in the county.&lsquo;&rsquo;Wale watu wengine ni wa vitendawili, msiwasikize, pigieni Jubilee kura. Even their manifesto has nothing to offer Kenyans. We have thoroughly gone through it and it has nothing to offer&rsquo;,&rsquo; Uhuru said.The DP said the opposition had no meaningful agenda in the manifesto it released on Tuesday.Kenyans, he said, now have an opportunity to compare the Jubilee manifesto, which is a robust plan with road maps and targets, and the &ldquo;empty statements&rdquo; released by the opposition.Ruto also dismissed plans by NASA to amend the Constitution to provide for a hybrid executive system based on the Bomas of Kenya draft. This would replace the current system in which the President is elected through a popular vote.The opposition is seeking to take the country back to the days when the executive, legislature and the judiciary were being micro-managed, Ruto said.&ldquo;We want to tell Raila that he cannot take Kenya back. He wants to change the Constitution to a hybrid system where the President decides what happens in the executive, legislature and the judiciary,&rdquo; he said.Ruto said the opposition was focussed on creating plum positions for its five principals, instead of seeking ways of creating jobs for the youth.He said unlike the five National Super Alliance leaders who plan to spend Sh15 billion &ldquo;to secure jobs for themselves&rdquo;, Jubilee would use the same amount to ensure every youth who graduates gets internships to acquire job experience.&ldquo;In our first 100 days (of re-election), we will make sure youths who graduate from technical institutes, colleges and universities get internship positions paid by the government,&rdquo; Ruto said.The Deputy President also criticised plans by the opposition to strictly regulate manufacture and consumption of&nbsp; traditionally home-brewed chang&rsquo;aa and other currently illicit liquor, if he wins the General Election on August 8.&ldquo;The Canaan the opposition was talking about taking Kenyans to is fake because it is the place where chang&rsquo;aa will be legalised. A person who intends to legalise chang&rsquo;aa is unfit to hold public office in this country,&rdquo; Ruto said.Present were Speaker of the National Assembly Justin Muturi, Kirinyaga Senator Daniel Karaba and governor aspirants Anne Waiguru of Jubilee and Martha Karua of Narc.The leaders addressed rallies in Kianyaga, Kutus, Kerugoya, Baricho Kagio, Sagana, Makutano, Wanguru, Mwea grounds and elsewhere.Ruto asked residents to vote for all JP candidates from MCA to President &mdash; six-piece voting for JP candidates only. That would be a setback for Narc Kenya leader Karua who was present to welcome the JP duo.At many stops, residents have rejected calls by both JP and NASA to vote straight party tickets,six-piece suits.On alighting from a Kenya Air Force chopper, Uhuru hugged Karua and asked how her campaigns were going.She answered, &lsquo;&rsquo;Huku tunamenyana tu.&rsquo;. Uhuru wished her all the best. Present was Waiguru, former Devolution CS who quit during the NYS scandal. Kirinyaga Governor Joseph Ndathi, running for reelection as an independent, was absent.
