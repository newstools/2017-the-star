Nick Otieno &lsquo;Kanyankole&rsquo; has promised to stop local Joseph Agbeko when the two square it off for the International Boxing Federation (IBF) bantamweight title at the Trust Sports Emporium in Accra on June 29.The fight was scheduled for June 9 but was pushed forward due to what Kanyankole described as unavoidable circumstances. Kanyankole, who is shaping up at Kariobangi Social Hall, said the change is a blessing in disguise as it gives him an opportunity to prepare a bit more.&ldquo;Although I know little about the Ghanian, the essence will be to bring him down as fast as possible. It is always safe to win via a knockout when fighting across boarders,&rdquo; said Kanyankole.The former Kenya international said he has been shaping up for some time now and feels upbeat. Kanyankole is shaping up under Paul Ottey in his quest for the title that could open up a window of opportunity in Europe.&ldquo;We are now focusing on tactics and we are already done with heavy training. I know I can jab and defend well. But the thing is the Ghanian will be leaving nothing to chance in his quest for glory,&rdquo; said the boxer.Kanyankole stretched his record to 31 wins (13ko&rsquo;s) and 11 loses when he beat Haji Ja of Tanzania to clinch the vacant World Boxing Association (WBA) Pan African championship title.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I have been able to stretch my record a bit more. Winning in Accra will be vital and I don&rsquo;t want that opportunity slip away,&rdquo; said Kanyankole who is a product of the Kariobangi production line. The former Telkom boxer won the WBA crown at Crown Plaza Nairobi on February 4.The Nairobi-based boxer is one of the most experienced pro boxers in Kenya at the moment. He took the vacant Universal Boxing Organization bantamweight crown against Twalib Muribu in December 2006. He was also the man who stopped African Boxing Union super flyweight champion, Francis Miyeyusho of Tanzania with a first-round knockout on April 5, 2010.
