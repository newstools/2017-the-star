Narc Kenya leader and Kirinyaga governor candidate Martha Karua was on Saturday heckled in her Gichugu backyard.Karua, who was accompanied by her running mate Joseph Gitari, was forced to cut short her speech as the crowd jeered her.Trouble started when Karua said Jubilee Party candidate Anne Waiguru is corrupt and should not be voted for on August 8.The crowd started chanting pro-Waiguru slogans and told off Karua saying she had nothing to show for being the area MP for two decades."You resigned justice minister after you had promised us you would lobby for the construction of Kianyaga - Kithure road but that did not happen."The rowdy crowd asked politicians in the area to articulate their development agenda instead of attacking personalities.Karua and Waiguru have been trading barbs against each other in their campaign rallies. The two are considered front runners for the seat.While Waiguru has been using Karua's age against her, the latter has been using the Sh.1.6 billion NYS scandal to convince the voters to reject the former Devolution CS.Waiguru says she was only a whistleblower who unearthed the scandal by informing the DCI to launch probe.Gichugu is considered the battleground in the August polls. Both Karua and Martha come from the constituency.Efforts by Gitari to calm the crowd were futile forcing the duo to call off the rally altogether."Tunataka Minji Minji, hakufanya maendeleo ukiwa MP," they chanted in reference to Waiguru's nick name.(We want Minji Minji. You did not develop the constituency when you are MP)Most residents in the county have castigated politicians engaged in name-calling.They have asked aspirants to campaign on a development agenda.Read: Residents want Waiguru, Karua to stop name-calling
