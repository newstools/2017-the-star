The government has dismissed claims by opposition leader Raila Odinga that the standard gauge railway was overpriced to the tune of Sh123 billion.State House spokesperson Manoah Esipisu yesterday told off Raila over his overpricing claim.He referred him to the relevant ministry and the Kenya Railways Corporation for more insight into the multibillion-shillings project.In a statement sent to newsrooms, Esipisu said the SGR has surpassed government&rsquo;s projection, with 1,300 people yesterday alone booking for passenger services.&ldquo;It is common knowledge that propagandists and purveyors of empty rhetoric, not believing that the train would be delivered on time and on budget have now focussed their noises on the notion that the SGR was somehow overpriced,&rdquo; Esipisu said.&ldquo;Nothing could be further from the truth.&rdquo;Last week, Raila accused Jubilee of inflating the cost of the project, and threatened to hold accountable those behind the overpricing if the opposition forms the next government.&ldquo;This is a grand coalition government project. We designed it and tendered it during our time in the coalition government. What Jubilee did when they came to power was to cancel the tender, re-tender it, and awarded it to the same company at a higher price,&rdquo; Raila said.He said the coalition government awarded the tender at Sh227 billion, but this was squashed when Jubilee took over, and re-tendered at Sh350 billion.Esipisu also said the government is committed to constructing a dry port in Naivasha.He denied claims the project will replace the seaport.Esipisu said the dry port will attract investments, create jobs, and offer cheaper and safer transport.
