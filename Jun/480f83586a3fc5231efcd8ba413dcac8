Ministers from Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya, South Sudan, Eritrea, Djibouti and Sudan are meeting in Nairobi to find answers to the devastating effects of desertification &mdash; one of the hazards that has crippled food production, depleted pastures, disrupted markets and caused widespread human and animal deaths. The two-day meeting is at the Crown Plaza. Environment CS Judi Wakhungu yesterday said desertification, land degradation and drought are critical issues to look at as the East African region is severely hurt. She said this in a speech read on her behalf by secretary of Administration at the ministry William Kiprono. She blamed the problems for low food productivity and insecurity. &ldquo;This is worsened by extreme climatic events. These challenges have serious impacts on socioeconomic development.&rdquo;
