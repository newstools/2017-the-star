For one suspected murderer in Japan, it has been a case of being able to run but not being able to hide.Left-wing revolutionary Masaaki Osaka has been arrested and charged for murdering a police officer during Tokyo street protests more than 45 years ago.He allegedly set the officer on fire using a Molotov Cocktail petrol bomb.No other suspected criminal has spent longer evading arrest, Japanese media report. The country has no statute of limitations for murder.The 15-year time limit was abolished in 2010.Where do prison escapees and absconders actually go?Osaka was arrested last month in a Hiroshima apartment belonging to the Chukaku-ha, or the Japan Revolutionary Communist League (JRCL). He is reported by police to have remained silent since being caught.The fugitive was initially accused of a separate offence - obstructing the police - before officers claim to have realised who he was.On Wednesday, he was transported from Hiroshima to Tokyo for further questioning, local media reported.Police say they have confirmed his identity through DNA tests because fingerprints were unavailable at the time of the crime.They say Mr Osaka was able to remain on the run for so long because he is a former high-ranking member of the radical left-wing JRCL and was assisted by sympathetic party associates.
