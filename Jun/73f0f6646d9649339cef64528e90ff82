Mt Kenya University students on Friday blocked General Kago Road in Thika town to protest against the setting up of illegal structures near their school.The students said the structures are criminal hubs and the thugs terrorise them, especially at dawn.They cited robberies, mugging and sexual harrassment.Drug peddlers sell marijuana and heroin in the structures, pretending to be selling food.Student leader Oginga Ogutu said, &ldquo;Last week, one comrade was stabbed as the thugs who came from these shops tried to steal his laptop. The same day some two women reported to the students&rsquo; heads that they were sexually harassed.&rdquo;He said the structures are hideouts for culprits.Ogutu added, &ldquo;Another freshman was caught with six rolls of bhang within the school and when asked he said he bought it at one of the shops.&rdquo;The students petitioned the school management to intervene as their security is in danger.&ldquo;We notified the management and a letter was written to the local authorities as well as the Kiambu county government. We are yet to receive any reply and no action has been taken ,&rdquo; Ogutu said.The students gave a seven-day ultimatum to the authorities, the Kiambu government and the owner of the structures to bring them down or they will demolish them.&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t let the thugs harass, rob and injure students anymore.&rdquo;
