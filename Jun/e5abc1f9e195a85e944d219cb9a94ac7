Police in Kwale are looking for burglars who broke into the governor's press office on Friday morning and made away with items worth Sh2 million.The items, including two laptops, two video cameras and a television, were later recovered. It is unclear how many people were involved in the 2am incident.Matuga police boss Michael Mwaura said it may have been an inside job."The suspect easily gained entry into the office without breaking the door," he said.He said two guards were on duty and Administration Police officers were guarding the adjacent National Treasury offices.Mwaura said the burglars also gained access to other offices in the building, which houses the Public Service Administration, Lands, Education and Payroll departments.Police recovered all the stolen items with the help of a matatu driver who filed a report about a suspicious person who boarded their matatu with the electronic gadgets at 4am.The driver said the suspect drew out a dagger and threatened to attack him, but fled instead, leaving the items behind.Public service chief officer Nurain Mwatsahu said he also suspects it was an inside job."I can say this is a well-coordinated thing by people within this building since no doors were broken," he said.He said the theft was similar to another one in which his laptop that contained information about staff was stolen early this year."We are disappointed by the laxity displayed by our enforcement officers on duty,&rdquo; he said. He said they could not rule out interference by Governor Salim Mvurya's opponents out to get crucial information on his campaign strategies."We think this incident has something to do with Governor&rsquo;s political rivals who might want to know what&rsquo;s going on in his offices,&rdquo; he said.Read: Jubilee wins big in Coast as Mvurya ditches ODM
