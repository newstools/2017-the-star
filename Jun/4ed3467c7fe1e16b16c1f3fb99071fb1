Security chiefs in Laikipia county have said KDF and other security agents would remain on the ground since the communities have failed to honour previous peace pledges. Assistant county commissioner Brenda Wangechi yesterday said many peace drives have been organised but conflicts erupt afterwards. Speaking during a consultative forum at a Nanyuki hotel, women from the pastoralist community called for inclusion in peace initiatives. Drought fuels many conflicts and the most affected are women and children. Resident Helen Leosono said, “As mothers and women, we have been sidelined in peace building processes, and yet we can persuade the morans to keep away from conflict-prone areas.”
