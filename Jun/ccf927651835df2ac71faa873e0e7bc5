Deputy President William Ruto has been told to apologise to the Luhya community for the remark he made against ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi while on the campaign trail in Kakamega.Speaking to The Star at Ganga trading centre in Funyula constituency, Samia subcounty on Sunday, residents, led by Bwiri ward ODM coordinator Thomas Buluma, said Ruto acted disrespectfully when he allegedly told the ANC leader to seek the position of IEBC chief executive officer.&ldquo;Respect is not slavery. If DP Ruto wants to develop a cordial relationship with the Luhya community and Western region at large, now and in future, let him respect Mudavadi and NASA leaders even if he is in the opposition because he is our man and we love him for what he is,&rdquo; Buluma said.Ruto&rsquo;s remark was prompted after NASA leaders&rsquo; questioned the move by Jubilee to award the ballot printing tender to Dubai firm Al Ghurair. Buluma praised NASA leaders for the effort they have made to ensure tallying of presidential votes is done at the constituency level to avoid manipulation of results.He said for the sake of transparency and fairness, tallying of presidential votes should be done at the constituency level. &ldquo;Tallying of presidential votes at the constituency level should be supported by all parties as one sure and credible way of curbing rigging. The opposition has suspects the Jubilee Party, which has opposed the move, might be planning to take advantage of the opportunity to manipulate the presidential results and this might lead to chaos,&rdquo; Buluma said.
