The government has suspended the compensation of IDPs in Nyamira and Kisii counties following claims imposters are claiming cash.Kisii county commissioner Samuel Njora yesterday said IDPs will now be paid at their subcounty headquarters after a committee verifies they are genuine.Speaking to the Star on the phone, Njora said, &ldquo;We have formed committees to verify the people on the list are genuine and known in their respective areas because some people interfered with the list. The committees will only verify, not profile the IDPs.&rdquo;The exercise has been marred by confusion and claims of favoritism since President Uhuru Kenyatta launched the exercise last week in the two counties. Njora said some names have been inserted into the list by crooks. &ldquo;Some people started the process of clearing the IDPs afresh, that is why we took over the exercise,&rdquo; he said.Njora clarified IDPs who were paid the Sh10,000 initially are not entitled to Sh50,000. &ldquo;We are not giving extra compensation to those who received the Sh10,000. We are concentrating on those who did not receive anything previously. The amount was increased to Sh50,000 because of inflation,&rdquo; he said.Njora released a new payment schedule which indicates IDPs in Kisii South will be paid tomorrow. Kitutu Central and Kenyenya evictees will be compensated thereafter. Sameta, Nyamache and Marani IDPs will be paid on June 19.South Mugirango MP and Kisii governor aspirant Manson Nyamweya yesterday said the compensation is &ldquo;too little too late&rdquo;.&ldquo;Jubilee is playing a cheap and losing game with the minds of the voters in this region. How come the regime is compensating people a mere two months to the election?&rdquo; he said.ODM MPs have accused Uhuru of bribing voters in the guise of compensating IDPs during campaign tours. Uhuru on Tuesday last week presented Kisii IDPs a cheque of Sh358 million.
