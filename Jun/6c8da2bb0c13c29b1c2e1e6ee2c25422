NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga has said he has no apologies to make to Deputy President William Ruto over remarks he made on legalising chang&rsquo;aa.Raila said Ruto misconstrued his comments that he meant if NASA formed the next government, chang&rsquo;aa would be taken by the public without control.The ODM chairman said there is nothing wrong with legalising chang&rsquo;aa if properly brewed and manufactured like in neighbouring Uganda.&ldquo;I said it is normal for residents to enjoy the drink after work,&rdquo; Raila said.He added that in Tanzania and Uganda, the brew is christened waragi and Konyangi respectively after it has passed through proper distilling processes and packed.
