Speaking at Olenguruone in their two day- meet the people tour, Ruto asked the region's voters to support Uhuru's re-election, saying he will take over after his second term."We have agreed with my friend [Uhuru] that after he wins this election, I will take over the steering and start putting things in order in preparation for 2022," DP said.He asked the locals to ignore Bomet Governor Issac Rutto and vote for Jubilee candidates during the August polls."You should ignore a guy whose position is number five in the opposition, why to gamble with a guy who is far away from leadership when I am already in the second position," he said.The DP and Kanu chairman Gideon Moi both want to take over from President Uhuru Kenyatta after his second term.In March, Gideon, despite perennial rivalry with the DP said he is ready to support his bid for State House in 2022."I have never crossed any path with him. I love him as much as he loves me," Gideon told the Star in an interview.The son of former President Daniel Moi was quick to add, however, that Ruto has never asked for his support.The two men are locked in a battle over who will be the Rift Valley kingpin.
