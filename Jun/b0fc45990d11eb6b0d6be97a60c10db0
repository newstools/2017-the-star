President Uhuru Kenyatta is expected to launch the much-awaited new ferry at Likoni Channel Crossing, despite a case pending before the EACC over inflated figures.The new vessel, MV Jambo Mombasa, is expected to start operations at the channel at the end of this month after its arrival from Turkey.During the 2016-17 Budget Reading, the state set aside Sh1.1 billion for the Kenya Ferry Services to purchase two new vessels and repair of the old ones.The EACC detectives had summoned several officials from the Kenya Ferry Services, including former managing director Hassan Musa, to record statements. According to the EACC report, MotoNguvu East Africa Ltd, which is owned by two directors &ndash; a Briton and a Kenyan woman &ndash; is also under investigations.The report further indicates that the company is hiding under the umbrella of an international Turkish company, Ozata Tersanecilik San Vetic Ltd, which won the tender for the vessels.New Mombasa EACC boss George Ojowi said several individuals will be charged after approvals from the DPPs office.&ldquo;This is one of the most serious cases we are handling. I assure you that several people will be charged. The figures were highly inflated,&rdquo; he said.The arrival of the new ferries will ease congestion.Currently, four ferries &ndash; MV Harambee, MV Mtongwe, MV Nyayo and MV Kilindini &ndash; are operating at the channel. The MV Likoni was moved to the Mtongwe channel after the commuters' pontoon was completed.The new designed vessel MV Jambo Mombasa, will carry about 62 cars and 1,391 commuters.The ferries are also fitted with CCTV cameras, zones for people living with disability. They are 84 metres long. The old ones are 70 metres long.The other vessel MV Safiri will arrive in November.KFS managing director Bakari Gowa said they will increase waiting bay space for commuters at both channels and expand roads after approval from the Lands ministry.He said Uhuru and other delegates will launch the new ferry on June 27. &ldquo;We are optimistic that the delays will no longer be experienced,&rdquo; he said.
