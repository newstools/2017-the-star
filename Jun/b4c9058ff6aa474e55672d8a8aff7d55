The KAA board has been ordered to reinstate acting managing director Yatich Kangugo, pending the hearing and determination of a case against his removal from office.The directive was issued on Tuesday by Justice Hellen Wasilwa of the Employment and Labour Relations Court.Wasilwa said the board had not complied with orders issued on May 31 for the official to be reinstated.Kangugo's lawyer Danson Omari said the claimant has continuously been harassed by the management.Omari reported that since the court issued the orders, the board has harassed and bullied the claimant with the sole purpose of frustrating justice."The claimant has been turned into an object of ridicule, contrary to fair labour practice as guaranteed in the constitution."Omari asked the court to issue further orders restraining the Kenya Airports Authority board from running proceedings other than those filed in court."The board has severally issued letters to show cause by the claimant, actions which amount to intimidation and abuse of power," he said.The judge directed that the main application by the claimant be heard on July 13.Read: KAA fires top managers in latest shakeupAlso read: KAA manager denies abuse of power charges
