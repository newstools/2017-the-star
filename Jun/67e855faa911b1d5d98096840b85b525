Murang&rsquo;a governor candidate Moses Mwangi has accused incumbent Mwangi Wairia of instigating a string of court cases filed against him by residents.He accused Wairia of attempting to use the courts to get him off the ballot as he is afraid of losing on August 8.&ldquo;Wairia is unable to explain to the people of Murang&rsquo;a what he has done with their money and that is why he is trying to ensure I am struck off the ballot,&rdquo; Mwangi said.He spoke to journalists on Thursday evening after winning another court case that sought to have him barred from running for county boss over party hopping.The case filed by Peter Gatawa and nine others in the High Court in Milimani accused Mwangi of jumping from the Jubilee Party to the Mzalendo Saba Saba party.It was filed after the IEBC Disputes Resolution Tribunal last Thursday dismissed a similar case filed by the same individuals.But Mwangi said he publicly resigned from the Jubilee Party a day before the nominations and joined the Mzalendo Saba Saba party.
