Gladys Shollei, the Jubilee candidate for the woman representative seat in Uasin Gishu county, yesterday said she does not regret working with the judiciary because she emerged stronger and smarter to engage in politics.She is former Chief Registrar of the Judiciary and quit over charges of abuse of office, which she denies. The case is in court. Shollei says she was hounded out of office unfairly but politics would give her a more satisfying post.&ldquo;I was humiliated and it was painful for me and my family and perhaps God wanted me to go through that but I have moved on well and I have no regrets having worked there,&rdquo; Shollei said.She spoke at a media breakfast in Eldoret town. Shollei said she is committed to transforming the woman representative seat into a &lsquo;Super MP&rsquo; seat that benefits Kenyans.
