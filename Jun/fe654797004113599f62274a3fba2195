NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga yesterday accused Deputy President William Ruto of swindling the proceeds of the Maasai Mara Game Reserve.He said that since the Jubilee administration took office in 2013, revenues from the Mara have not been benefitting residents because the DP and his ally, Governor Samuel Tunai, have been working together to fleece them.Raila spoke during a rally at Ngoswani trading centre in Narok West constituency, where he ended his two-day tour of Narok county.He was also scheduled to address rallies at Olchorro in Narok North constituency and Narok Stadium later in the day.&ldquo;The reason why the people of Narok are languishing in abject poverty is because these two leaders have been fleecing park revenue money,&rdquo; Raila said.He added that about Sh3 billion is collected from the park annually, but this cannot be accounted for.Raila said the new Land Act, which was supposed to resolve the park issue, was changed by the Jubilee administration to please a few individuals and protect their own interests.&ldquo;Maasai Mara is community land and it should be managed by the people and the county government. But the Jubilee administration has changed the law to suit its interests. It is now managed by the national government,&rdquo; the ODM leader said.&ldquo;They formed their own company, which collects revenue from the park. That will change once the NASA administration takes over. &ldquo;We will revoke the tender and employ back many youths, who were sacked after the company was introduced at the gates of Maasai Mara.&rdquo; Raila was accompanied by his co-principals &mdash; Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka, ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi, Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula and Chama Cha Mashinani leader Isaac Rutto.Other leaders present were Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho, MPs Patrick Ntutu (Narok West), Moitalel ole Kenta (Narok North), Elijah Memusi (Kajiado), Mathew Lempurkel (Laikipia North) and Junet Mohamed (Suna East).vote out jubileeRaila urged residents not to vote for Jubilee and its candidates, saying they have let them down. He also accused the Jubilee administration of failing to implement the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission report to resolve historical injustices.Kalonzo said Ruto has been making several trips to Narok town not on developmental matters but for personal gain.&ldquo;We know DP Ruto is using the governor to fleece the Mara revenue. Come August, that will change because we want our people to benefit from their resources,&rdquo; Kalonzo said.Governor Rutto said the NASA administration will ensure 45 per cent of Kenya&rsquo;s revenue is devolved to the counties.In a quick rejoinder to the Maasai Mara revenue claim, the Narok county communications office dismissed the allgeations and termed them misleading.It lashed out at Ntutu for lying about revenues from the game reserve, while praising Tunai for having turned around the park&rsquo;s fortunes, saying it is now profitable.&ldquo;Those are the usual, unsubstantiated claims we have been hearing from Patrick Ntutu and the cartels that used to fleece the Mara revenues before Governor Tunai closed up corruption loopholes by contracting the Kenya Airports Parking Services to automate gate collection fees,&rdquo; it said.&ldquo;The allegations are false and malicious and can only mean that Raila Odinga has been hoodwinked by Ntutu to lend his support to well known lords of corruption in Narok.&ldquo;Ntutu has been campaigning on the promise of &lsquo;opening the taps of the Mara&rsquo; back to what they were before Tunai took over.&ldquo;Misleading Raila Odinga into supporting corruption is a continuation of Ntutu&rsquo;s efforts to claw back the reforms iniated by Governor Tunai.&rdquo;
