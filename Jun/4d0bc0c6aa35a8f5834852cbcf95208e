Justice George Odunga yesterday declined to excuse himself from hearing Machakos governor aspirant Wavinya Ndeti&rsquo;s case.In his ruling, Odunga said the IEBC&rsquo;s application does not meet the test for him to disqualify himself.He said the application by the commission is a manifestation of bad faith.&ldquo;It looks like the IEBC wants to choose a judge who is sympathetic to their case,&rdquo; Odunga said.He said any judge has a duty to determine any case and has the ability to carry out the mandate he was given under oath, unless reasons are given to warrant one to recuse himself or herself.On Tuesday, the IEBC made an application, asking Odunga to disqualify himself from hearing Wavinya&rsquo;s case and transfer it to another judge.Lawyer Paul Nyamodi for the IEBC wanted Odunga to allow the matter to be heard by another judge. different opinion.But Wavinya, through her lawyers opposed the application, saying the IEBC has not convinced the court why the judge should disqualify himself from hearing her appeal.Last Friday, Ndeti got a reprieve after the High Court directed the IEBC to include her name among those of other aspirants.Odunga temporarily set aside a ruling by the IEBC Disputes Tribunal that nullified her Wiper nomination.In the ruling, Odunga said refusing to grant the stay in the circumstances, would make it impossible for Ndeti to recover ground she will have lost while her opponent&rsquo;s carry on their campaigns.Ndeti said the IEBC did not adhere to the principles of the Constitution and the Political Parties Act, and in particular, provisions on membership to a political party.The IEBC tribunal had nullified Ndeti&rsquo;s Wiper&rsquo;s nomination.This was after MCA Peter Kyalo filed a petition, saying she is a member of two parties &ndash; Wiper and CCU.He said Wiper violated the Elections Act by allowing a &ldquo;stranger&rdquo; to participate in its primaries.Kyalo said Wavinya&rsquo;s nomination should have been rejected by the returning officer &ldquo;because it was irregular, unlawful and nullified by the disputes committee&rdquo;.The case will be mentioned tomorrow for inter-parties hearing.
