Nigeria-owned e-commerce firm Mall for Africa opened its Kenyan office on May 26 at the Mirage in Westlands.The online shopping platform launched operations in Nairobi early this year in a bid to cash in on the growing demand for online shopping.&ldquo;We see Kenya as the biggest e-commerce opportunity in East Africa and the numbers and data show it,&rdquo; CEO and cofounder Tope Folayan said.Kenyans are increasingly taking up to &lsquo;e-tailing&rsquo; &ndash; whereby they shop online and have the goods delivered to their homes or offices.This has resulted in the entry of new players and expansion by existing providers.The Mall for Africa has more than 8.5 billion items for sale at more than 150 US and UK stores, such as Amazon, Carters, Fashion Fair Cosmetics, Topshop UK, Barneys, Bloomingdale&rsquo;s and J Crew.
