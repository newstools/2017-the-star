The six are suspected to be members of Gaza, a group known for causing terror to residents in some estates in Nairobi.The prosecution asked the court to deny the minors bond due to their alleged association with Gaza, saying they may interfere with witnesses.

The six did not take plea.The magistrate ordered they be remanded at the Murang&rsquo;a police station until June 21 when the case will be mentioned. The suspects&rsquo; parents were orderd to produce birth certificates in court.
