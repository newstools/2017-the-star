Migori Governor Okoth Obado has urged candidates to control their supporters and prevent violence.Violence broke out in Migori ahead of the ODM nominations in April. The trouble brought to fore the deep-rooted rivalry between elected leaders in the county over the governor&rsquo;s seat.Obado spoke on Thursday after the IEBC cleared him to run for reelection on the ODM ticket.He addressed thousands of supporters in Rongo, Awendo, Uriri and Migori towns. &ldquo;We now want to campaign officially. We should be peaceful. Violence will not bring unity among our people,&rdquo; Obado said.He ditched PDP for the Orange party last year and defeated former Minister Ochilo Ayacko, Ann Anyanga and Paul Odola during the ODM nominations. The governor, who has won a number of court battles against his bid to vie on ODM ticket, presented his papers at the Migori Teachers Training College. He was accompanied by Deputy Governor Nelson Mwita. Obado has retained Mwita as his running mate. &ldquo;I have my deputy as my running mate. I have worked with him and I know him well. With him, I am sure we shall win the race,&rdquo; he said. Obado pledged to complete projects he started in his first term.&ldquo;I want you to remain sober and steadfast in supporting me. This is the time we have to make the right choice in electing a capable leader. I&rsquo;m the one. We need to complete our work and ensure more projects are initiated for a better Migori,&rdquo; the governor said.Obado was also accompanied by nominated MP Oburu Odinga, who asked residents to vote in all ODM candidates in the region. &ldquo;I also urge the people of Migori to make sure they vote NASA presidential flagbearer Raila Odinga to State House. Let us all vote in unity to win this race,&rdquo; Oburu said.
