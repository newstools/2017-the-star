Opposition leader Raila Odinga has accused top Jubilee leaders of having a hand in the award of a ballot papers tender to Al Ghurair Printing.Al Ghurair is to print about 120 million ballot papers, election results forms and poll registers.Raila said on Tuesday that information they have indicates the firm has had contracts with senior Jubilee officials for at least three years."Owners of this firm hosted senior Jubilee officials in Dubai in February last year, when the ballot printing tender was discussed," he said during the National Elections Conference in Nairobi on Tuesday.He said officials of the firm were in Kenya in October 2016 as heads of a business delegation."...they were brought by the Dubai Chamber of Commerce during which trip they held further talks on this contract with Jubilee officials."Raila termed as "bad faith" the awarding of the tender to the Dubai firm, adding IEBC ignored their concerns."This development is ill-advised and unfortunate. This firm holds partisan political positions and all this has never been disclosed. The firm will undermine the credibility of the elections," he said."This casts a dark shadow, which could have been avoided, on the credibility of the elections. There appears to have been a clear determination by the IEBC to award this tender to the Dubai-based firm no matter what."The NASA flag bearer said the commission has time to give the tender to any other firm ahead of the election on August 8. He said it is not too late to re-examine the award and make different decisions.Raila noted credible elections are about credible processes that should not give anyone undue advantage."We have been victims before and are definitely concerned. It is not too late for the IEBC to do the right thing. We would like to see free fair elections in our country," he said.But IEBC CEO Ezra Chiloba said an attempt to block the Sh2.5 billion contract given to Al Ghurair Printing and Publishing Company will make it impossible to hold the general election.The caution was in response to a February nullification of the same tender by the High Court, after the Opposition challenged it on grounds there were illegalities in its awarding.Chiloba also told the National Assembly Justice and Legal Affairs Committee that Al Ghurair was picked because it has modern machines and a capacity of 50 per cent set aside for production of ballot papers.He said the company also has a suitable emergency production, packaging and delivery plan in addition to fully deployed experienced and qualified staff.More on this: Raila to declare his stand on ballot papers tender todayUSE OF STATE RESOURCES FOR CAMPAIGNSRaila further accused IEBC of failing to take action against the government and CSs using state resources to campaign.In April, the electoral commission warned public servants against using state resources for campaigns. Anyone found violating the law is to be fined Sh2 million or jailed six years."We have seen the government using its record in office and public-funded projects as campaign tools for Jubilee," the presidential candidate said.Raila added there have been reports of public institutions being asked to channel public funds into Jubilee campaigns."The IEBC has remained silent in the middle of all this. That is worrying indeed. It is not a way to build faith that the elections will be free, fair and credible and that all players will be subjected to similar treatment under the law."On June 1, ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi accused Jubilee of forcing organisations to contribute money for campaigns which officially kicked off on May 28.Mudavadi said President Uhuru Kenyatta's administration should not put pressure on MDs and CEOs and warned that NASA is keenly monitoring the government's moves ahead of the election.The politican did not give details and The Star could not independently verify the claims.
