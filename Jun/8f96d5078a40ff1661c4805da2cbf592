Oserian and national team utility player Dorcas Shikobe is fit again to face Wadadia in today&rsquo;s Zone &lsquo;B&rsquo; Kenya women&rsquo;s Premier League match at their backyard.The experienced player picked an ankle injury in the training session and she has been down for the last two weeks.The hosts are placed third with six points from two matches while their opponents are second with seven points from three matches. Vihiga Queens lead the log with 12 points after unbeaten run. Oserian coach Hudson Odari confirmed the player will turn up for her side in a must-win-match for the flower girls.&ldquo;Shikobe is an instrumental player at the club since she can play in any position. I am glad she has recovered well in time for the match,&rdquo; said Odari.The flower girls, who boast of three national team players, have maintained unbeaten run so far and will be keen to extend the good form.&ldquo;Our past record against our opponent is good. We won against them last season home and away and we hope to extend the good form against them. But this is a new season altogether and therefore we will be cautious,&rdquo; said the tactician.He added: &ldquo;We retained the same squad that came close winning the title last year and therefore the players are ready and set ahead for tomorrow&rsquo;s (today) duel. We are currently third on the standing and a win will definitely propel us to the second position.&rdquo; The three players who play for the national team from the Naivasha-based outfit are defender duo of Irene Ogutu, Anita Adongo and Shikobe.
