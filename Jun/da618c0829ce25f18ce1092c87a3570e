We expected them to act more firmly since the woman was innocent and her family's bread winner. She left behind a very young family," he told the press in Webuye town on Friday.The activist noted police are yet to arraign the bodyguard of Bungoma Deputy Governor Hillary Chongwony in connection to the killing of the woman.''Ken Kisa, who was arrested on the same day the woman was killed, by Bungoma South OCPD David Kirui has not yet been charged and we are wondering why,'' he said.Lukoye said the law must be applied without bias and that Kisa should be charged with misusing a firearm and causing the death of the woman.She was buried in Northern Uganda by family members who did not want politicians involved.
