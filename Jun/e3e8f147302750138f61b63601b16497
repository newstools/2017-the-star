Ndung&rsquo;u spoke in Wajir town on Monday.Wajir South subcounty livestock development officer Julius Kienji said, &ldquo;The pasture recovery was observed in Wajir East, Wajir North, and parts of Tarbaj.&rdquo; He said, however, other regions such as Wajir West, Wajir South and Eldas subcounties received insufficient rainfall. As a result of the improvement in livestock conditions, household milk production per day slightly increased from two litres in April to 2.5 litres this month.Agriculture executive Yusuf Gedi attributed the increase in milk production to increased pasture, reduced trekking distance and improved livestock body weight.He said average milk production is slightly above the average from 2012-2016 recorded during the same month.County National Disaster Management Authority coordinator Yahya Hassan said the improvement in livestock has led to better prices.&ldquo;Due to improved livestock body conditions and high demand in the market, cattle prices improved from Sh15,000 in April to Sh15,500 in June,&rdquo; Hassan said.Similarly, goat prices increased from Sh2,569 in April to Sh2,974 this month.Camel prices increased from Sh24,750 in April to Sh35,000 this month as a result of better weight and health and high market demand.
