NASA will economically and socially empower the Maa community and all others facing marginalisation, ODM secretary general Agnes Zani has said. Zani issued a statement on Monday in response to claims that ODM leader Raila Odinga incited the Maa while on a tour of Kajiado county last week. Raila was quoted telling the Maasai community not to sell their ancestral land to "outsiders". The remarks sparked fury from Jubilee leaders who called upon the NCIC and the Directorate of Public Prosecutions to probe Raila for incitement.

Many other communities including those in the Coast need empowerment, something the government has not been able to do." The Nominated Senator further said the TJRC report clearly indicated how historical injustices will be addressed. "Addressing poverty is a key pillar in NASA. One way is to retain ancestral assets and build them up. [Speaking about this cannot be hate speech]," she said.
