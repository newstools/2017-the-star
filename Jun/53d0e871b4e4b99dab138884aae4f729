The NASA brigade took their campaigns to Machakos town Monday and condemned the killing of Mumias Sugar company secretary Ronald Lubya.Lubya was shot dead on Sunday night in his house by three gunmen.The NASA co-principals blamed the killing on the government, linking it to the officer&rsquo;s failure to bow to the state&rsquo;s &ldquo;pressure to agree to the illegal importation of sugar&rdquo;. &ldquo;It is very sad that moments after I had issued a statement in Bhukungu Stadium warning public officers against being forced into signing for the withdrawal of company money to go towards financing election campaigns of the Jubilee government, on Sunday night, the company secretary of Mumias Sugar, who had refused to bow to such demands was shot dead in his house and his wife raped,&rdquo; ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi said.The co-principals demanded investigations. NASA presidential flagbearer Raila Odinga likened the killing to that of businessman and government critic Jacob Juma last year. Raila said that the killing was orchestrated by the state and was done to instil fear in opposition supporters. &ldquo;It is only last year when they killed my friend Jacob Juma after he revealed a plan to assassinate me and until today the investigations have never been completed. They have now killed the Mumias company secretary for objecting the signing of illegal importation of sugar from Sudan through Uganda,&rdquo; Raila said.
