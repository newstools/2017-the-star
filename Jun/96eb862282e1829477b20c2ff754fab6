In last week&rsquo;s article, The curse of plastic, I focused on the source of pollution from the city and ways to minimise plastic pollution in the park by reducing the availability of plastic bags and encouraging the use of paper bags and proper shopping bags as an alternative.This week, I wish to focus on the current reality inside the park. On May 26, it was noted that there was a wonderful cleanup involving the Kenya Wildlife Service, Friends of Nairobi National Park, Bigfoot Adventures and many primary schoolchildren. The result of much effort was a huge truckload of rubbish consisting mostly of plastic and drink containers. However, I have noted that there is still much rubbish visible from the park roads, so more cleanup operations are required on a regular basis with the assistance of KWS/Fonnap and other concerned parties.Apart from plastic, it is important to address and act to solve other pollution issues that flow from Nairobi city into the park. Some examples include the flow of human waste effluent into the Hyena dam, and the flow of waste from opposite the Galleria Mall into the park. Toxic smoke from fires and factories have a negative effect on all life inside or outside the park, as does chemical waste. The various picnic sites still have a major problem with litter, as the baboons have managed to break open many of the waste bins. Clearly a more robust waste bin solution is needed. We need to ask ourselves a question: &ldquo;What can I do to keep the park clean?&rdquo; We can all help stop pollution today for a better tomorrow by taking responsibility. Let us be proud of a clean, green Nairobi.
