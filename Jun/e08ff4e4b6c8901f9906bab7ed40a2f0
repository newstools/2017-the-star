TSC CEO Nancy Macharia has dismissed claims that the teacher's CBA is being implemented due to the scheduled August 8 elections.She said in Homa Bay on Friday that the salary increment, which occasioned the 2015 strike, has nothing to do with the slated polls."TSC is an independent Commission which has nothing to with politics. This CBA is being implemented in accordance with the law."Teachers are going to have new pay structures from July 1 in line with the CBA that Knut signed with TSC in October last year.The comprehensive bargaining agreement provided that the teachers would be promoted before July 2017.The deal reached in Naivasha also scrapped off the P1 grade entry level for teachers and expanded the grading structure of the top cadre of all the teachers.Read: Knut, TSC sign CBA to end perennial strikes, scrap off P1 entry gradeOn Friday, Knut secretary general Wilson Sossion welcomed the development saying it will avert future teachers strikes.Sossion said the CBA, whose Implementation Matrix has been agreed upon, will facilitate structured and constructive dialogues."Though we agree that the CBA deal will be implemented in phases, we call on the employer to further endeavor to shorten the period.""We are prepared to amend the CBA to accommodate such positive changes," Sossion said in a statement.More on this: SRC impediment to pay talks, Sossion says as TSC rolls out Sh54 billion teachers' pay dealAlso read: TSC to spend Sh54 billion on CBA between Knut, KuppetMacharia, during the burial of a teacher killed in an al Shabaab attack in Garissa, also asked county directors to consider safety of teachers during posting.She asked education officials to ensure only natives are posted in areas considered to be under threat of terrorism.CEO Nancy Macharia on Friday said those who are not originally born in places considered as hardship areas be posted in safe regions.Teachers experience hardships in areas prone to terrorism, with difficult terrains as well as those without water."I direct all TSC county directors to post teachers who are non-locals to schools located in areas which are safe," Macharia said.She gave an example where a teacher from Homa Bay county is posted to Garissa county.Macharia argued that posting teachers to areas they don't understand pose challenges for them to escape in times of danger.She spoke during the burial of Elly Oloo, a teacher who was killed following an al Shabaab attack in Garissa in May."This is an effort to boost safety and security of our teachers besides taking care of their wellbeing as they deliver services," she said at Koliech village, Karachuonyo.Garissa county director of education Margaret Kinyanjui described the late Oloo as a teacher who dedicated in his work."He showed commitment in his work despite the short period he was employed," Kinyanjui said.The teacher was employed and posted in the area in January this year.
