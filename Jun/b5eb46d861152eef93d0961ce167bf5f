ODM candidates in Kisumu
have planned a series of rallies to popularise their
candidature and consolidate votes for NASA presidential flagbearer Raila
Odinga. The rallies are aimed
at making inroads in areas where independent candidates have gained ground and unite voters from Raila’s backyard. Mombasa Governor and
ODM deputy party leader Hassan Joho is expected to lead the candidates and the Nyanza
presidential campaign team in the vote hunt. The rallies are planned for Ahero town, Nyando, Kenyatta sports grounds and the famous Kirembe
grounds in Kisumu town. Kisumu county ODM
chairman Kennedy Ajwang said they are not leaving anything to chance. “We expect various ODM
top leaders to launch the campaign in the county,” he said. Raila and his NASA
co-principals are expected to attend the rallies. Homa Bay woman rep
Gladys Wanga, nominated MP Oburu Oginga and Kisumu Deputy Governor Ruth Odinga
are among the chief campaigners for Raila’s presidency. Senator Anyang Nyong’o (Kisumu governor candidate) and Nyando MP Fred Outa (senator candidate) are part of the team. Nyando MP candidate Jared Okello yesterday echoed Raila's call for six-piece voting.
