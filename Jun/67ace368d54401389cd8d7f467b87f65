The Constitution, in Article 138 (8) holds that a presidential election shall be cancelled and a new election held on three grounds, one of which (b) reads, &ldquo;a candidate for election as President or Deputy President dies on or before the scheduled election date&rdquo;.All presidential and deputy presidential election candidates are therefore equal for purposes of the election. The threats against Dida may not be of the same magnitude as those against, say, NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga. But the best course of action would be to leave it to the professionals and competent authorities &mdash; the National Police Service.Police guards and government vehicles come at a cost and are a public service paid for by the taxpayer.Dida&rsquo;s request should not be dismissed out of hand, but it should be proportionate. He garnered only 52,848 votes, or 0.43 per cent of the popular vote, back in March 2013, but who knows what this year may bring?
