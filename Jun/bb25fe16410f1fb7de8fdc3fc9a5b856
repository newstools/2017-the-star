Nigerian songbird Seyi Shay has been in the country for a media tour. She was hosted by Adelle Onyango, where she opened up about some of the things she loves about Kenya, and the possible artistes she would love to collabo with.During her media tour, she got the chance to listen to Fena Gitu&rsquo;s banging jam Sema Ng&rsquo;we, which has been well received across the country.One thing we got in the midst of her excitement is Seyi&rsquo;s keenness to work with Fena, among other Kenyan celebrities.Seyi was even singing along to the song, which was pretty impressive, considering it&rsquo;s in Kiswahili and she&rsquo;s Nigerian. Fena could not contain herself as she expressed her joy, stating: &ldquo;She has been one of my dream collabos for the longest time. I&rsquo;ve followed her career keenly since &lsquo;Murda&rsquo;. You know a collabo with her would be off the charts!&rdquo;
