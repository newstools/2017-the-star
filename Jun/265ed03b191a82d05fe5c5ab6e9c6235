Jubilee and Kanu supporters clashed during a rally led by Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago in Baringo on Saturday.Kanu supporters stormed the event at Kabarnet High School chanting 'Kanu juu' and 'Gideon Moi tosha' as they wagged the party symbol of one finger.Those from Jubilee tore placards bearing Senator Gideon Moi's image.Anti-riot police arrested those who disrupted the event even as some shouted "Jubilee is a buried democracy".When he finally addressed the crowd, Mandago said Jubilee is a peaceful party."We cannot accept to attend one meeting with a group of hooligans," he told residents, adding that it poses a threat to security.The leaders were in the area to campaign for Jubilee Senate candidate Simon Chelugui who is believed to enjoy considerable support from DP William Ruto.More on this: My bid against 'heavyweight' Gideon Moi is unstoppable - CheluguiThey pronounced Kanu dead and asked the community to back Jubilee for the August 8 polls and Ruto for president in 2022.Gideon has also announced intentions to vie for the presidency in 2022."If Gideon Moi wants to work with the government, he has to concede defeat and cross over to Jubilee so he can be accommodated and slotted in a certain seat, lest he remains in the cold," Mandago said.He said the Nandi and Kipsigis communities supported former President Daniel Moi for more than 30 years so it is time the Tugens back Ruto."This can only be proven if Baringo people vote away Gideon and usher fresh blood Chelugui to the Senate," the Governor added.Kenya Film board director Jackson Kosgei expressed bitterness at Gideon's leadership."I was told to step down for Gideon (in 2013) so that I may be given a post, so I did. Now why is it to painful when he is now told to step down for another person," he said.Read: Don&rsquo;t ashame me in August elections, Gideon Moi tells Baringo residentsThe leaders also told off Opposition leader Raila Odinga for his remarks about the KDF."Even if Raila suggests his own house to be the vote tallying centre, Jubilee is still going to win by a big margin," Baringo North MP William Cheptumo said.The leaders asked the Opposition to preach peace as the country prepares for the August 8 polls.Among those who attended the rally is Kericho Senator Aaron Cheruiyot, Elgeyo Marakwet Governor Alex Tolgos and other Jubilee candidates.They received a similarly hostile reception in Eldama-Ravine, Kabartonjo, Kipsaraman, Marigat and Mogotio.Much of Baringo is considered to be a Kanu stronghold.
