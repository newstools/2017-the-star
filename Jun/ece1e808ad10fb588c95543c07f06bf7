An anti-corruption lobby has asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to intervene so that thousands of people who bought land in Laikipia county decades ago are issued with title deeds. In a letter to Uhuru, the Futa Magendo Action Network claims more than 40,000 people have been trying to secure land ownership documents, but their efforts have been frustrated by some directors of land-buying companies, some of whom sell land to third parties.&ldquo;Recently, when you were in Nyeri, you directed that squatters who have been living in colonial villages be issued ownership documents for the pieces of land they occupy. Kindly extend the same gesture to Laikipia,&rdquo; James Mugo, the director of the lobby, said in the letter. Yesterday, Josephat Waswa, the National Land Commission official in charge of Laikipia county, accused land-buying company directors of greed, saying some have been charged in court.
