The National Super Alliance last evening postponed the launch of its manifesto from today to June 27, 41 days to the August 8 election. NASA campaign chairman Musalia Mudavadi said this &ldquo;is in respect to the last 10 days of Ramadhan, when Muslims are deeply engaged in the most intensive prayers of the holy month.&rdquo;The alliance had earlier announced it would launch its manifesto this evening at an invite-only ceremony that was to be beamed live on major television stations from 7pm.The ceremony was expected to last about three-and-a-half hours at Ngong Racecourse. NASA chief executive Norman Magaya said the manifesto heralds radical reforms in all key sectors, and will revolutionalise the management of public affairs, and give special attention to basic needs. The opposition alliance has anchored its blueprint on seven policy pillars, coupled with region-specific manifestos.These include national reconciliation and healing; resolving historical injustices; realising equality for women, youths, persons with disabilities and disadvantaged communities; and strengthening devolution. It also involves transforming the government into a servant of the people; realising social and economic rights; eradicating poverty and employment; and dealing decisively with corruption.For instance, NASA has launched a &ldquo;Pastoralist Livelihoods Protection and Marketing Plan&rdquo;. The alliance says the plan, which targets 29 counties in arid and semi arid regions, will ensure social and economic empowerment, and help manage conflict. In an interview with the Star, NASA co-principal Mudavadi said Kenya&rsquo;s economy is in shambles because of bungled social development, aborted devolution, mega corruption and a failed education system. The ANC leader said Kenya has poorly managed healthcare, sabotaged agriculture, runaway crime and insecurity, and fumbling foreign policy, which he promised to correct.&ldquo;We will ensure a purposeful leadership, strong vibrant economy, agriculture and food security, good accessible healthcare, accessible world-class education and social protection for women, youth, and persons with disability,&rdquo; he said.During his campaign tours, Raila has promised to lower the cost of living in 90 days. He describes the manifesto as a &ldquo;contract worth the signature of every Kenyan&rdquo;.
