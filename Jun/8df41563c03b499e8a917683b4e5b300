Vihiga Senator George Khaniri has said President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto are desperate and are now clutching at anything to remain relevant.Khaniri said the outburst by President Uhuru during his tour of Kakamega county on Sunday, and attempts to revive the ICC debate are indications Jubilee has ran out of ideas after realising most Kenyans have abandoned them.Uhuru threatened to teach Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale a lesson for inciting Ikolomani residents against the government.In Shinyalu, the President told indifferent crowds he will win a second term in office even if they don&rsquo;t vote for him because he won in 2013 without their votes.&ldquo;They tried to resurrect the ICC debate and it failed. They are now hanging on NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga&rsquo;s &lsquo;caution&rsquo; to Maasais not to sell their land,&rdquo; he told the Star on the phone yesterday.Khaniri said Uhuru is stooping too low by threatening leaders who tell him the truth about his administration. &ldquo;He started with Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho and now Khalwale. Kenyans are not fools and can differentiate between real concerns and propaganda. The die is already cast for Jubilee,&rdquo; he said.On Sunday, Khalwale recorded a statement at the Kakamega Central police station claiming the President had threatened him. Police said they would start investigations but nothing has so far come of it.Khalwale on Sunday addressed a crowd at Malinya market in Ikolomani before the President&rsquo;s arrival.He told the cheering crowd Jubilee is out to hoodwink them into supporting their bid for a second term.&ldquo;Uhuru has not done anything here in the last four years and cannot do anything in the remaining one-and-a-half months,&rdquo; Khalwale said. Yesterday, Khaniri said Uhuru cannot persuade the people of Western to listen to him because his government ignored them from the beginning.On Sunday, Uhuru said, &ldquo;You have leaders who come here pretending to be heroes but what they do is insult others instead of selling their policies to the voters...tutamnyorosha [We will discipline him].&rdquo;But Khalwale said via Twitter: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve this morning recorded a statement at Kakamega Police Station concerning Uhuru&rsquo;s threats against me.&rdquo;Regional police boss Moses Ombati confirmed the senator had recorded a statement and that the matter is under investigation.&ldquo;He was here in the morning. We are waiting for more evidence before taking any action,&rdquo; he told the Star on the phone.&ldquo;After getting details we shall act.&rdquo;Khlawale&rsquo;s post elicited mixed reactions from his followers, with others saying he is wasting his time.&ldquo;Hehehehe, you are a big joke, you are just wasting your time and energy,&rdquo; Eric Kogi said. Muregi George said, &ldquo;Cheap publicity that will bring the bullfighter down politically.&rdquo;
