Police in Webuye on Tuesday night nabbed two people found transporting 554 litres of chang&rsquo;aa and 3,216 packets of Uganda waragi after a tip-off.Jackson Owino aged 29 and Simon Mutuu, 24, come from Busia county.They are believed to have been ferrying the liquor to Langas estate in Eldoret.Bungoma East police boss Zacchaeus Ngeno said the two were intercepted at Lugali village, Matisi, on the Eldoret-Malaba highway.Ngeno told a journalist at Webuye police station the two were transporting the alcohol in a saloon car that bore a Ugandan registration numberplate.He said Owino and Mutuu had gone to the homestead of David Opicho, a resident in the area, to ask for help after the vehicle which was carrying the drinks developed a mechanical problem. Ngeno said the liquor was wrapped in paper bags to conceal it. &ldquo;We are now waiting for staff at the Kenya Bureau of Standards to come and confirm whether the stuff is fit for human consumption,&rdquo; Ngeno said.The police boss said if it is confirmed that the drinks are being smuggled from Uganda, then it means the government has been losing a lot in revenue.&ldquo;We want to thank the members of the public and urge them to continue informing us and giving us information that could lead to such arrests,&rsquo;&rsquo; Ngeno said.&ldquo;We want to warn the people who want to use this Northern Highway corridor to ferry drugs that they will not succeed.&rsquo;&rsquo; He said Owino and Mutuu will be charged in a Webuye court once police are through with their investigations.In April last year, Philip Khaemba, a milk vendor from Namwanaga village in Kimilili town, collapsed and died after drinking a glass of illicit brew to get rid of a hangover. He was his family&rsquo;s breadwinner.Residents said police have not done enough to eradicate consumption of illicit brew.
