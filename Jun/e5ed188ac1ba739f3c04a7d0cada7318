Independent candidates should stop meddling in the affairs of Jubilee Party, two politicians from Murang&rsquo;a have said.Governor Mwangi Wairia and woman representative Sabina Chege said independents have publicly shown they are not loyal to the party and should therefore not attend its functions. The two spoke on Thursday, a day after confrontations emerged between independents and Jubilee Party nominees over who was to attend the President&rsquo;s visit last Wednesday.Jubilee Party nominees insisted independents, led by Senate Deputy Speaker Kembi Gitura, have no business being in the President&rsquo;s convoy yet they had decamped from the party. Gitura lost nomination for the Murang&rsquo;a Senate ticket. The independents were thrown out of the meeting at Blue Post Hotel where leaders were waiting for Uhuru.Wairia praised Uhuru for being clear that he would only work with the Jubilee Party team during his visit. &ldquo;It would not help to have a President who does not have footsoldiers. Having people in power who do not subscribe to the ideologies of the President&rsquo;s party would be problematic.&rdquo;Chege said the law is clear that an aspirant either vies through a political party or as an independent candidate. &ldquo;If they want to show how loyal they are, why don&rsquo;t they step down and join the party?&rdquo;
