Some Kiambu residents who turned up at various trading centres in the county during UhuRuto&rsquo;s campaign trail on Sunday defied President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s six-piece voting pattern plea.The locals, holding and waving placards with writings &ldquo;UhuRuto Sawa, The Others Let The People Decide&rdquo; said they back the reelection of Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto, but will decide on who to vote for other elective seats.Addressing the crowd in the Thika stadium, the President said, &ldquo;I plead with you to give us leaders who we will be able to work with. And most of them are here. Our governor, I don&rsquo;t know where he has gone. Baba Yao is here, Mama County is here, na [and] mheshimiwa wa Thika Town is here.&rdquo; Uhuru was referring to Kiambu Jubilee governor candidate Ferdinand Waititu, also known as Baba Yao, and Thika Town MP candidate Alice Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a. Waititu will face off with incumbent William Kabogo, who is running as independent. Nga&rsquo;ng&rsquo;a also faces stiff competition from Patrick Wainaina, also running independently.&ldquo;We plead with you to support them so that we can have one government,&rdquo; Uhuru said.This, however, did not go down well with some supporters. In Ruiru, residents waved Kabogo&rsquo;s placards when he asked the crowd to listen to Ruto and Baba Yao&rsquo;s speeches.In the Thika stadium, UhuRuto had an even harder time convincing residents to support Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a.Ruto said the Jubilee government needs foot soldiers who will ensure full implementation of the Jubilee manifesto.&ldquo;You Kiambu people should know that you are Jubilee county number one and other counties are taking bearing from Kiambu. If you mix while voting you will mislead other counties,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You should put a straight line from President Uhuru, governor, senator, MPs and MCAs.&rdquo; But the crowd jeered at him, chanting the name of her main competitor, Wainaina, alias Wajungle, he attempted to invite Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a to address the gathering.When Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a started to address them, she was heckled in full glare of the President, making her cut short her speech in haste, with &ldquo;jungle&rdquo; and &ldquo;hatutaki suti&rdquo; slogans rocking the air.The crowd remained unmoved when the DP called Senator Kimani Wamatangi to speak.Residents who spoke to the Star after the event said it was wrong for UhuRuto to recommend a six-piece voting pattern like they did in the run-up to the previous election. In 2013, when they spoke on the same podium, they urged locals to vote for leaders who were contesting on the TNA ticket.&ldquo;They made their promise to Kenyans that they will only seek their votes and leave the rest of the seats to Wanjiku to decide. We won&rsquo;t repeat the mistake we made in 2013. Let them not impose leaders on voters. Instead, they should leave the democratic space to Kenyans to vote for leaders of their choice,&rdquo; Denis Kili, a resident said.Another resident, Eunice Waithera, said UhuRuto should have heeded to pleas by independent candidates and other parties supporting their reelection not to endorse JP candidates.&ldquo;We will vote for UhuRuto but in the grassroots, we will make our individual decision because we are the ones who know whether they can deliver better than the President and his deputy. We plead with the duo to leave the job of voting for leaders at county levels to residents,&rdquo; she said.A number of leaders from the Central region who were defeated in the nominations have blamed Jubilee leaders for conducting what they have termed &ldquo;shambolic nominations&rdquo;.Some of them opted to resign from Jubilee Party and are now running as independents.
