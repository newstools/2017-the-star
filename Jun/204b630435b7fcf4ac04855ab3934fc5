Homa Bay senator aspirant Shem Ochuodho has moved to the Judicial Review Court seeking orders to suspend the IEBC's June 5 decision barring him from vying in the General Election.He says if the court does not grant the orders, the people of Homa Bay will be denied the opportunity to elect the senator of their choice.The aspirant said the IEBC was irrational in dismissing his complain on grounds that he was out of time in handing in his nomination papers, despite presenting the them with a banker's cheque on May 29, as ordered by Homa Bay county returning officer.Ochuodho said he had appealed the IEBC decision at the High Court but his application was dismissed on grounds that the court has no jurisdiction to hear appeals on the decisions of teh IEBC."The judge instead advised me to seek judicial review orders then the court will have considered my appeal," Ochuodho says.He adds that on the day he received a call from the returning officer directing him to present his nomination papers, he sent his representatives to submit them on his behalf because he was out of the country."The returning officer Michael Kosgei advised me that l would make cash payments when submitting my papers due to the short notice he gave me," Ochuodho says.Ochuodho adds that when his representatives got to Kosgei's office, he turned them away and informed them to make the payments in a banker's cheque.The aspirant further adds that his representatives proceeded to KCB to obtain the said teh Bankers cheque but they were informed that the bank services were not available that day and would have to seek the cheque elsewhere.His representatives went to a nearby town and obtain the bankers cheque and went back to Kosgei's office to present his nomination papers and the cheque.Ochuodho says that the returning officer declined to accept the same, stating that he was out of time and yet his papers were presented on May 29.
