Toyota Kenya yesterday denied that HINO FC500 model vehicles are unfit for sale.In their response to a case filed by several motorists, Toyota Kenya argues that the HINO brand is of high quality, durable and reliable if maintained and serviced. GM of HINO Kenya Gerald Muli says any defects in the vehicles, including any overheating problems, arose as a result of lack of maintenance as per the manufacturer&rsquo;s recommendations.HINO Kenya is a division of Toyota Kenya.Several motorists moved to court saying HINO FC500 model truck and PSV buses have developed fatal engine and overheating problems, brake systems failures, and chassis cracking during the subsistence of the respective warranties that rendered them unfit for the purpose.Through lawyer Harrison Kinyanjui, the motorists say they have exhausted all avenues of resolving the problems and the defendants have failed to respond. &ldquo;The management of Hino Ltd and Toyota Kenya was all along aware that the HINO FC500 model was and is unsuitable and unfit for the PSV purpose,&rdquo; he said.They also say no brand new vehicles develop such a multiplicity of problems resulting in total grounding and even lack of spare parts replacement without a defect. The suit has been filed by City Star Shuttle Co. Ltd, Chania Prestige Shuttle Ltd, Beauty Wholesale K. Ltd and eight others.
