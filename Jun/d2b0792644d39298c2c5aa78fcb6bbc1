KCB Group plans to start selling insurance covers through its countrywide agency banking network early next year in a bid to increase non-interest revenue through bancassurance.The head of KCB's bancassurance unit Winnie Njau said the lender was developing a system which will enable agents book insurance policies and accept premiums on the spot without &ldquo;creating any channels of risks&rdquo;.&ldquo;The next frontier we are looking at is the agency banking and how we will use KCB Mtaani to boost the uptake of insurance policies at the village level, so that the local person can buy insurance policies at their doorstep without having to travel many kilometres to the branch," Njau said in an interview. &ldquo;Once we have a reliable software, we should be able to roll out by the beginning of 2018."Uptake of insurance policies in the country has remained below three per cent of the gross domestic product compared to South Africa's 17 per cent. The low penetration has largely been attributed to little innovation in the industry.Consultancy PricewaterhouseCoopers said in a report on earlier this month that the country's insurance industry was slower in embracing innovation despite partnerships with financial technology firms redefining the insurance business globally.&ldquo;Technology will be key to overcoming the stumbling blocks and increasing Kenya&rsquo;s low insurance penetration. These stumbling blocks include archaic legacy systems, high cost models, poor products and regulatory restrictions,&rdquo; PwC said in a statement on June 14 . &ldquo;Kenyan insurance companies can learn a lot from their South African counterparts who enjoy the second highest insurance penetration in the world.&rdquo;Njau said the insurance industry has potential to achieve a 10 per cent penetration rate in the medium term by reviewing their service delivery channels by fully automating their services.She said KCB has condensed seven policies into one product targeting micro- and small-sized enterprises."We are in the process of re-configuring our systems to enable them pay their premiums as per their ability on a monthly basis as opposed to collecting the premiums upfront," Njau said. &ldquo;With the coming on board of banks which are more trusted in the financial sector, more clients are now willing to speak to banks and are positive towards them."Poor governance and mistrust following the collapse of a number of insurers in the last two decades, she said, has adversely affected uptake of insurance covers despite rising risks.Njau pointed also out lax in enforcing insurance regulations by regulators leading to mismanagement of the insurance industry.
