We all danced to Princess Jully's Dunia Mbaya hit song. We still do. What we don't all know is, the creator of that beautiful piece of art is living in poverty.Recently, Jully was visited by good Samaritan Winnie Augo, who highlighted the plight of the singer. For a while now, Princess Jully and her son, Makajully, have been struggling to revive her music career."I was at her home in Bondo Nyironge at 10am. At first she was not very comfortable with me but later on she became relaxed. We talked a lot while enjoying the lunch she made. As I was planning to leave, I handed her the small parcel I carried for her (courtesy of my friends in Kisumu). She suddenly became so emotional."According to Winnie, the songstress was so happy and she took time to pray, thanking God for sending the angel (Winnie) to rescue her.Winnie added that Jully performs at local events, where she is paid very little that can't sustain her. "The income is not much. She sometimes ends up paying her back-up singers anabaki bure. In addition to this, she has a recurring throat infection brought about by sharing a microphone. Even if she treats it, the infection still comes back. So I will buy her a microphone next month so the pain goes permanently. That's the little I can do for her,'' Winnie said.
