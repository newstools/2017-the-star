Mike Sonko has attacked former Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth for his 'wearing suits without brains' remark but noted he has forgiven him.Kenneth, who is also vying for Nairobi governor, said the Senator has acquired a new image - donning suits every day - but has no brains to show for it."Huyo jamaa anajua hawezi...ndiyo maana amaeanza kuvaa masuti lakini akili ni ile ile...huwezificha na suti (This man knows he cannot do the job...that is why he has started wearing suits...but his mind is the same old one...you cannot hide it in a suit," said the independent candidate.More on this: DP Ruto helped Sonko rig me out of Jubilee primaries, says Peter KennethAddressing supporters in Mathare on Wednesday evening, Sonko lashed out at Kenneth saying he should be preparing his agenda for the county, not attacking him."Yeye anaanza kuingilia suti zangu...awache siasa ya kunitukana...viongozi waheshimiwe.. alianza kusema ati Ruto ni mwizi.... mimi nimemsamehea...," Sonko said.This loosely translates to: "He has started attacking me based on my suits...he should stop politics of abuse...leaders should be respected. He claimed DP William Ruto is a thief...I have forgiven him."Sonko said he was elected by Nairobians based on what he offered, not because he does not have brains."Walinichagua kama Senator kwa sababu sikuwa mkora...wewe (Kenneth) wacha uchotara wako...wacha uzungu wako...uza sera zako (The people chose me as their Senator because I am not a crook. You get your hands dirty and sell policies)," he said."Uko na bahati siku hizi mimi niko na heshima ya hali ya juu. Katika jina la Yesu wewe na pepo yako mbaya, na uchotara wako, nimekusamehea (You are lucky that I am very respectful nowadays. I rebuke your bad spirit...I forgive you)."Sonko said violence would break out if he and Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero also incited the people."We know you as a spoiler because you fought President Uhuru Kenyatta in 2013. But we still forgave you and welcomed you into our party,&rdquo; he said.Read: Peter Kenneth quits Jubilee, to run for Nairobi governor as an independentThe politician reiterated that Kenneth should respect Uhuru and Ruto."Hiyo agenda yako ya pepo mbaya wacha ikae kando (Your ill-spirited agenda should not prevail)," he added.Kenneth accused the Deputy President of rigging him out during the Jubilee Party primaries.He lost to Sonko but rejected the results claiming there were massive irregularities.The politician who once vied for president, said he did not lose the nominations as his opponent "was assisted by somebody high up in the party hierarchy.""Somebody wanted to cut me down to size politically.
