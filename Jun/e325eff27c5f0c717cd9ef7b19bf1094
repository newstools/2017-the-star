Don&rsquo;t struggle for small jobs like this one for Senate. I am confident you will be CS,&rdquo; Chepsoi said.He said Murkomen has networks within government and should not worry if he loses.&ldquo;This political duel between Murkomen and me will be like the biblical David and Goliath fight. I am David and he is the Goliath,&rdquo; he said.Chepsoi added, &ldquo;Even a bee can scare an elephant.&rdquo;But Murkomen said, &ldquo;What Chepsoi meant is that Murkomen will become CS and Rotich be removed.
