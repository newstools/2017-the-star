The Finance and Revenue Collection Committee of the Machakos assembly now wants the EACC to investigate a case of tax evasion by a private company in the county.In report tabled in the assembly on Thursday, the committee recommended that action be taken on the Simba Cement Company for not paying cess to the county government.&ldquo;Members established that the Finance department had exempted the company from paying cess to the county government, something that amounted to conflict of interest, since one of the company's managing directors was an executive committee member in the county government,&rdquo; Finance committee chairman Oliver Nzeki said.He said the county government was losing more than Sh25.9 million annually through the agreement.&ldquo;The committee observed that the county was failing to collect Sh1,200 per lorry for every trip and for an approximate 50 trips per day all year round,&rdquo; Nzeki said.He said the move to exempt the company from paying cess not only amounted to conflict of interest, but was also against the Constitution.
