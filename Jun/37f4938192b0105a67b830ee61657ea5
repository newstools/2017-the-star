Two armed thugs robbed five M-Pesa shops of more than Sh1 million in one hour in Limuru town, Kiambu county, on Wednesday evening. Owners of the outlets said their customers were not spared in the robbery  that took place between 7pm and 8pm. The criminals were two youths armed with a pistol and a G3 rifle. An agent, James Gaitho, said:  “At first we thought they were customers. When we asked them the service they wanted, brandishing  a pistol,  they ordered the three customers who were waiting to be served to enter and lie down and remain silent or be shot. The customers were then ordered to surrender all their money.” “They stole over Sh250,000 from my shop. I am not sure how much customers were robbed, but one had Sh25,000 he wanted to deposit. That was around 7.20pm.” Samuel Wainaina, an M-Pesa shop agent, was caught up in the robbery at Gaitho’s shop. He had left his outlet to look for loose change. He, too, was robbed. “I could see people passing outside when I was on the floor. I started praying for my customer’s patience. I thought she would come to look for me,” Wainaina said. Gaitho said robbers target M-Pesa shops because they are assured of getting “quick money”. “They don’t steal mobile phones even if they are new. This is not the first time,” he said. Ann Wangui says they entered her shop, and after robbing more than Sh300,000 from her and her customers, they ordered them to get into the shop’s changing room and wait for them to leave. “We were called by customers seeking for service,” she said. Limuru Central MCA aspirant on the ODM ticket, Mary Muigai, has urged police to beef up security. “It is so sad to see many people being robbed by only two people,” she said. AP boss James Mwaura said they have intensified police patrols to prevent a repeat of the robbery.
