Lamu residents yesterday threatened to vote out all incumbents if they do not make their stand clear concerning the establishment of a Sh 200 billion coal-fired power plant in the region.They said they are angry because Governor Issa Timamy, Senator Abu Chiaba, MPs Julius Ndegwa (Lamu West), Lamu East&rsquo;s Athman Shariff and MCAs have remained mum. They have complained that almost all the leaders in Lamu are silent on the matter, and have left the battle to Lamu woman representative Shakila Abdalla (pictured).She is the only the politician who has been vocal in rejecting the project.Some environmentalists say the project will harm residents&rsquo; health and the environment.The project proposed site is at Kwasasi in Hindi, Lamu west.&ldquo;A leader is supposed to seek out good things for his people. He must make his plans known to his people so as to attract their support. Here in Lamu, leaders are quiet over the coal plant and we know it&rsquo;s because most have been paid in exchange for their silence. But not to worry, the general election is nigh and that&rsquo;s when they will know we have had our eyes on them all along. Even the new entrants aren&rsquo;t safe either. You must speak and let us know whether or not you support the project, then we will decide,&rdquo; Omar Yusuf, a resident said.He said the new entrants must oppose the coal plant to be elected.Speaking to journalists in Lamu, residents said they are tired of leaders who cannot stand up for wananchi&rsquo;s rights and who can easily be bought by people interested in destroying the county. Activists in the county have also opposed the project, which they say portends more harm than good to the people of Lamu.
