The Talk Dirty king is coming to Kenya this month. Jason Derulo will be in Nairobi for the 5th edition of Coke Studio Africa. Word on the street is that the deal to get the Wiggle hitmaker is "95 per cent done", according to industry insiders. Apparently, Jason was among two other hot stars on the Coke Studio Africa hit list. "Future and Ed Sheeran were being considered for the season," our source whispered, "But due to other commitments, they couldn't make it. But Jason Derulo is definitely coming. That deal is cooking and it is 95 per cent done." Derulo's music is generally pop, but also incorporates R&B and hip hop influence. He has predominantly named Michael Jackson as his inspiration, according to his online bio. Derulo states: "He is the reason I am who I am today. When I was four years old, I saw him for the first time. I saw how he moved the crowd and how people were just so touched." His other musical influences include Elvis Presley, Madonna, Prince, Usher and Justin Timberlake. Currently, Jason's latest music offering Swalla (feat. Nicki Minaj and Ty Dolla $ign) is a favourite of fans after it topped various music charts. Jason is one of the international acts to be featured in the premiere music show, which also had top acts like Trey Songz, Neyo and Wycleff Jean. Some of the African stars on the show include Avril, Kahligraph Jones, Maphorisa (South Africa), Bruce Melodie (Rwanda), Kill Beatz (Ghana), Slap Dee( Zambia) and Busiswa (South Africa).
