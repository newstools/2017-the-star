Labour and employment relations court in Nakuru has ordered Football Kenya Federation to pay Sh900,000 as salary arrears to a Naivasha stadium caretaker.In a judgement by Justice Stephen Radido on Wednesday, he ruled that failure by FKF to present their case before the court is a justification that they owe the claimant unpaid salaries. On February 21, the federation through their lawyer told the court that they were closing their case without leading evidence and the claimant lawyer filed submissions.&ldquo;After failure by the respondents to present or give lead evidence, the court finds that the claimant has proven his case on a balance of probability,&rdquo; ruled Justice Radido. Elvis Mwangi, a caretaker of the proposed FKF&rsquo;s Stadium in Naivasha went to court mid last year and sued the federation over unpaid salary.Mwangi was appointed through a letter dated September 10, 2014 and earned a Sh50,000 as basic salary but it was stopped by FKF after some few months.Mwangi in his affidavit, said the football body stopped paying him after 3 months of service and he had to report the matter to labour office in Naivasha, who immediately wrote a letter to the FKF president but there was no response till date. &ldquo;I am suffering as a result of FKF&rsquo;s malicious and unfair actions, I have a family to fend for and our situation is getting worse because I am not receiving any salary,&rdquo; reads part of the affidavit.He said he has not received any money since the beginning of last year and that&rsquo;s why he seek court intervention after the federation failed to respond.Advocate Wachira Wanjiru, who filed the case under a certificate of urgency, said the respondents failed to honour the letters and calls by the labour officer to pay her client. She prayed to the court that the respondents be ordered to pay Sh900,000 as a salary from January, 2016 to the date of the application.Wanjiru said the county labour officer in Naivasha wrote three letters to FKF president Nick Mwendwa to pay the arrears immediately but he has failed to comply.The federation through their replying affidavit by General Secretary/CEO Robert Muthomi, said the federation has never employed Mwangi as caretaker.Muthomi added that the letter of appointment owned by Mwangi is a fabrication by Mwangi and another person who intend to defraud the federation.He further said the federation is not aware of such proposed stadia and do not have any plans to put up a stadium in Naivasha. Justice Stephen Radido certified the matter as urgent and decline to issued orders until the case is heard and determined.
