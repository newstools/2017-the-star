Trouble is looming in Migori county among IDPs after two factions emerged with different lists of names of people to be compensated. This comes as President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto plan to visit the county and issue cheques. On Wednesday, Suna East subcounty commissioner Steve Kavulu met the two factions to ensure there is peace ahead of the president&rsquo;s visit. The factions are led by Fredrick Juma Mboya and John Marienga, who both claim they are coordinators of the Migori county chapter of the National IDPs&rsquo; Network. &ldquo;We need to reconcile the two and ensure the presidential visit goes on smoothly. It has been 10 years since the violence and we must ensure there are no wrangles,&rdquo; Kavulu said. Mboya&rsquo;s list has 1,630 beneficiaries, while Marienga&rsquo;s has 1,675.
