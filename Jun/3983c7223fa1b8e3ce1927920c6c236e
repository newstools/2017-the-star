The first group among 38 pardoned inmates will leave Lang&rsquo;ata Women&rsquo;s Maximum Prison on Saturday.They were pardoned on Thursday by the High Court, which reviewed their sentences, crimes and good behaviour behind bars.Three more &mdash; foreign nationals &mdash;were ordered released after serving reduced terms.The prison has about 600 inmates. Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu on Thursday said the 38 will start leaving the correctional facility immediately, in groups.The nature of their offences was not disclosed. She said a Tanzanian and two Burudian immigrants jailed for being in the country illegally will be repatriated after completing their jail terms.The foreigners were incarcerated after courts ordered them to pay fines and be repatriated, or serve a jail term before the repatriation. But judges who reviewed their sentences recommended they be released and repatriated immediately instead of staying in the prison.The judges considered the duration each offender spent in pre-trial detention, the time they spent in jail as convicts and their post-conviction behaviour, among other factors.Mwilu said this will decongest the prison and give the freed inmates opportunity to rebuild their lives.Officer in charge of the prison Olivia Onyango had sent the prisoners&rsquo; files to the judges for review.Mwilu led justice Hannah Okwengu of the Court of Appeal, principal judge in the High Court&rsquo;s criminal division Jessie Lesiit, and Justice Lydia Achode and Grace Ngenye in the Madaraka Day celebrations with inmates at the prison.Others were High Court Registrar Ann Amadi and several magistrates. Mwilu said regular review of prisoners&rsquo; sentences will be carried out in other prisons to ensure that those who should be set free are released.&ldquo;It is only fair to pardon some of the inmates and the criteria used is based on their behaviour and their sentences,&rdquo; Mwilu said. She said some cases take too long to be heard and this causes psychological torture to offenders in prisons.
