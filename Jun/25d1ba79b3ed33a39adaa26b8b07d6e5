Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula has hit out at Bungoma Governor Kenneth Lusaka, accusing him of using county resources to fund Jubilee Party campaigns.Wetang&rsquo;ula says he has received a report at the Senate that an executive in the county government has deposited more than Sh700 million in his private account in the past two months. He said the motive of keeping the money is unknown.The senator was addressing residents on Friday at the Bungoma bus terminus. Wetang&rsquo;ula is defending his seat on the Ford Kenya ticket, while Lusaka is running for governor on JP.The senator said Lusaka&rsquo;s administration should be investigated for mismanaging county resources. &ldquo;This will ensure wananchi do not lose more money,&rsquo;&rsquo; the NASA co-principal said.Lusaka rubbished the claims, saying Wetang&rsquo;ula has run out of ideas.&ldquo;I thought the senator is a learned lawyer who knows where to take these complaints if he has enough evidence instead of spreading lies and propaganda to wananchi who are now wise and will not believe him,&rdquo; the governor said.He said no bank can allow such an amount of money to be put in an individual&rsquo;s account without raising questions.
