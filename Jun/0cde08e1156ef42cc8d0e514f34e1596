Nyatike MP Omondi Anyanga has accused some top ODM officials of scheming to frustrate his nomination as the party candidate for the seat.The lawmaker hit out at a section of influential officials at Orange House "for working in cahoots with my political detractors to deny me my right"."They want to frustrate me despite the massive support I have given for many years to the party and its leader Raila Odinga," he told the Press at Parliament Buildings.The MP slammed individuals close to the party leader of initiating legal proceedings against his nomination to settle political scores.He named Raila's spokesman Dennis Onyango and lawyer Kennedy Okong'o of launching a malicious campaign aimed at discrediting his nomination, with instructions from a senior female member of the Jaramogi family.Onyango and Okong'o have denied being behind the plot."Okong'o is a guy I have known to be my political enemy for so many years. Today he is the ODM lawyer filing a case against me. He has filed malicious documents obtained from social media," the MP said.Anyanga said he won the ODM ticket fair and square as was affirmed by the ruling of the Political Parties Disputes Tribunal and the High Court.More on this: Relief as High Court declares MP Anyanga ODM nomineeAlso read: ODM disowns MP Anyanga, moves to Appeal court to nullify nominationHigh Court Judge Luka Kimaru certified Anyanga's certificate as genuine and ordered IEBC to clear him as nominee for the parliamentary seat.But the orange party has disowned Anyanga as its nominee for the August 8 polls and moved to the court of appeal for his certificate to be nullified.Anyanga has accused some officials of stage-managing an affidavit denouncing the certificate "to please a certain woman in the Jaramogi family" "The party's national elections board gave me the certificate duly signed by the three signatories which I presented to IEBC and I was cleared," he added.If ODM has doubts about the signatures, Anyanga said, handwriting experts should determine their authenticity."As far as I know, the signatures I see are those of election board chairperson Judith Pareno, executive director Oduor Ongw'en and secretary Robert Arunga," he said.
