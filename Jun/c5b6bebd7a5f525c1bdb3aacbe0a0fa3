President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday said opposition leader Raila Odinga is not a nationalist, but a selfish leader who specialises in dividing Kenyans along tribal lines. He said Raila is so divisive that he even cites debt waivers for coffee farmers to incite other Kenyans, while ignoring the fact that subsidies for farmers has been done on a national scale. Uhuru spoke during his tour of Murang’a county. The President said the government has subsidised coffee farming, the same way it subsidised sugarcane farming and has invested a lot of money on reviving the New Kenya Cooperative Creameries to serve Kenyans from other regions. “The government has subsidised farmers across the country. He forgets we implemented livestock insurance to serve pastoralists and we have put in so much money to revive Pan Paper Mills,” Uhuru said in Gatanga. The President also criticised Raila for statements he recently made in Kajiado, which he said were meant to incite Kenyans. He said the statements could not be expected from a leader who aspires to be the head of state. “Do you want to be President of Kenya or President of a few tribes?” Uhuru asked. He said Raila is busy trying to put a wedge between different communities, instead of uniting Kenyans. “Raila is a specialist in dividing Kenyans. We want a united Kenya, unlike what Raila is advocating for,” he said. He said Kenyans will not be hoodwinked by Raila’s statements, because no one wants the country to go back to what happened in 2007-08. “I’m surprised at what he is saying. He is not talking as a leader, because no genuine leader can stand in front of Kenyans and claim that some people should leave a certain area,” the President said. Uhuru said Raila is fond of giving a tribal slant to everything the government does, forgetting that Kenyans are now wiser. The President also criticised Raila for politicising security meetings being held by all security agencies. Uhuru said the meetings are being held to ensure peace and stability. He said the Jubilee administration has done a lot to unite Kenyans and has addressed grievances that were ignored by previous governments. “We gave citizenship to the Makonde people, who were ignored for decades. We have even solved the land problem of the Nubians, who were neglected for so long and who Raila served as MP for many years,” the President said. He was accompanied by Deputy President William Ruto. Uhuru urged Murang’a people to reelect the Jubilee administration for a second term.
