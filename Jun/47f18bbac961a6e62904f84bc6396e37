Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago and his rival in the county race, Bundotich Kiprop, met for the first time at the Idd celebrations in Eldoret town yesterday.They publicly traded exchanges over their policies and promises to the electorate ahead of the August 8 polls.The two called for peaceful campaigns, urging supporters not to clash or engage in violence.Buzeki is vying as an independent candidate. He was cheered widely and said he would give Mandago a job in the county government if he wins.&ldquo;I have nothing against my brother Mandago. We are both children of Uasin Gishu and whoever wins we have agreed we will support each other,&rdquo; Buzeki said.But Mandago retorted, saying he is confident of winning and would employ Buzeki as his Trade minister. &ldquo;You know Buzeki is a businessman and the job of Trade executive in my government suits him,&rdquo; Mandago said.The governor said he is in office and has already delivered a lot to benefit the muslim community, including providing an enabling environment for business.He denied he has sidelined any community or religion in his administration.Mandago said the Jubilee government has not sidelined Muslims because they have been included in the Cabinet. However, Buzeki said Muslims have been mistreated and denied rights, including national ID cards.&ldquo;Once I take over as governor I will ensure we will install street lights and good roads in residential and business areas so that you enjoy doing business, unlike the situation we have currently,&rdquo; he said. Buzeki said residents of Uasin Gishu should make a choice on the kind of leader they want based on their policies.&ldquo;You should listen to us carefully and then go and think about our policies, then decide.&rdquo;Mandago urged Buzeki not to be too confident about clinching the seat and allow him to be governor for a second term.&ldquo;Five years is not a lot surely. I am asking my brother Buzeki to be patient and allow me to complete what I have started, then he can take over,&rdquo; the incumbent said.Buzeki declined a plea from Deputy President William Ruto to step down for Mandago.The businessman told residents of Uasn Gishu to ignore the Jubilee leaders&rsquo; call for a six-piece voting pattern and go for leaders based on their policies, not party affiliation.&ldquo;Uhuru and Ruto have been told over and again they will get votes for the presidency, but as concerns other seats, Kenyans have asked to be left to decide for themselves.&rdquo;Ruto said Mandago won the primaries in Uasin Gishu and deserves to be supported by all those who lost, including Buzeki.&ldquo;Waswahili husema asiyekubali kushindwa si mshindani (A Kiswahili saying goes &lsquo;he who does not accept losing is not a true competitor)&rdquo;. &ldquo;Buzeki should now withdraw and back Mandago.&rdquo;
