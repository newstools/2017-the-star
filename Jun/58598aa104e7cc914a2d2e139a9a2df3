Opposition leader Raila Odinga has accused Jubilee of dragging KDF into politics by deploying more than 100 of them to Kakamega.The NASA presidential candidate claimed on Tuesday that the soldiers were selected to rig the August 8 general election.Raila noted they are not driving a wedge into their relationship with the military but appealing to them to honour their code and be neutral."KDF soldiers are being trained for recruitment as polling and presiding officers to help rig the election," he told a press conference in Nairobi."Several officers are being hosted in Kakamega at the former provincial HQ. They are being prepared to become ROs."Raila further claimed the soldiers are training civilians and that the programme is similar to what was allegedly done at the same venue before the 2007 general election."We are challenging the national government and leaders of security forces to explain why military officers are training civilians," he said.He noted: "A training of KDF officers on crowd control is going on at Embakasi military barracks."More on this: KDF, NIS officers take training on preventing violence during pollRaila noted Kenya needs good leadership and peace considering the violence that took place after the disputed 2007 election."This country deserves good leadership.

That is why we are pointing this out," he said.Raila, who is also ODM leader, linked the National Intelligence Service to a vote rigging scheme by the Jubilee administration.He revealed NIS and top security officials recently held three meetings in Naivasha to ensure President Uhuru Kenyatta retains power at all costs.The Opposition chief claimed former Chief of Defence Forces General Julius Karangi is chairing the secret meetings.
