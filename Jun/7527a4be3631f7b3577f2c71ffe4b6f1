Suspected armed Pokot bandits raided Yatya, Baringo North subcounty, and stole 30 goats and 16 cows owned by Elijah Kiburet, a Tugen herder, on Wednesday.Barketiew sub-location chief Jackson Keitany confirmed the 6pm incident, saying there was no exchange of fire.&ldquo;We followed the footprints to the neighbouring Tiaty subcounty, but Pokot residents and chiefs were not willing to give reliable information,&rdquo; Keitany said. Due to rising insecurity, learning for more than 4,000 pupils has been disrupted.Keitany accused Baringo county leaders of politicking instead of fighting insecurity. &ldquo;The bandits are having a field day knowing that it is politics season and no one bothers so much about them,&rdquo; he told the Star on the phone yesterday.
