Kirinyaga governor JP nominee Anne Waiguru has asked residents to ignore non-Jubilee aspirants.She said this is because President Uhuru Kenyatta needs foot soldiers in both the Senate and the National Assembly.Waiguru spoke at Kimbimbi market centre on Wednesday. She said voters should opt for a six-piece voting pattern in favour of JP and dismissed her rival Martha Karua as a nonstarter.Waiguru asked Uhuru to endorse the JP team from the MCA to the President, since they will work within the JP manifesto and deliver on JP projects both at the national and county level.
