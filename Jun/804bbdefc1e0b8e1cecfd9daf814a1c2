The hearing of a criminal case against former Starehe MP Margaret Wanjiru, who is charged with malicious damage to Sh30,000 property during the JP nominations, has been postponed until July 24.She faces another charge of creating a disturbance in a manner likely to breach the peace during the JP&rsquo;s nominations for Nairobi governor.On May 2, the cleric denied the charges. When the case came up for hearing before Milimani trial magistrate Martha Mutuku yesterday, Wanjiru, through lawyer Kennedy Ochieng&rsquo;, applied for adjournment, saying she was not ready to proceed.She asked for more time to enable her to prepare her defence. The prosecution did not oppose the application, but informed the court it was ready to proceed with the case.The magistrate granted Wanjiru&rsquo;s application for adjournment and directed the case be heard on July 24 without further delay.Wanjiru is out on Sh500,000 cash bail.The prosecution, led by Assistant Director of Public Prosecutions Alloys Kemo, opposed her bail application, saying police had not completed investigations into the offences against her.Wanjiru later moved to the High Court in Nairobi under a certificate of urgency.A High Court judge overturned the lower court decision that directed she remain in custody for five days.The magistrate had also imposed Sh500,000 cash bail, which was to be processed after the five days in police cells.Wanjiru is said to have stormed City Park polling centre during the primaries and allegedly destroyed voting materials over a mixup in the ballot papers.It is alleged that she, in the company of about 50 rowdy supporters, caused fear among clerks who were presiding over the exercise at the station.Before her arrest, Wanjiru said she found ballot papers of Dagoretti South constituency in the station, which is in Karura ward, Westlands constituency.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m calling upon the National Elections Board to repeat the election for City Park Market polling station because the exercise started at 3pm and we have now found ballot papers for Dagoretti here,&rdquo; Wanjiru said on polls day.Wanjiru denied wrongdoing, saying she was inspecting the voting process when she found a booklet with the names of aspirants in another constituency.A video also went viral showing a person considered to be the former legislator as she gave out cash handouts to youths as the Jubilee primaries were about to kick off.Wanjiru eventually lost in the primaries. She came third after Senator Mike Sonko and former Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth.
