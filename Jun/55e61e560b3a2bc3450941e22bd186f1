Otile Brown is one of the fast-rising singers in Kenya and without a doubt, this coast-based singer has made a name for himself. The Alivyonipenda hitmaker has, however, come out to clear his name after being accused of stealing a laptop by a fan who called live on radio. Talking exclusively to Word Is, Otile Brown said: “Watu wanatoka mbali, na watu kutoka mbali
huweziniletea stori ya 7 years ago. When I was a broker for phones and
laptops, trying to survive in Mombasa.Unajua Mombasa ni mji wa wahuni…I
was a hustler trying to make ends meet.” Otile, who now has a new song called Kistaarabu, added: “Sasa hizo time nilikua
nimemuuzia vitu nyingi. Kumbe hii laptop alinipea nilienda kuuzia
muhuni…Jamaa akahepa, ikawa ni kesi. Nilipoibiwa nikamwambia
nitakurudishia, nitakulipa. Nikamwambia anidai pole pole…Ikaakaa,
nikatoka Mombasa nikaja Nairobi 7 years down the line alafu mtu anakuja
kunidai…Unapiga kwa redio. Haistahili hata airtime yangu…” Otile described how the man was later attacked by his fans after embarrassing him: “In my hood, he was really attacked, Coz in i’m like this king, the big deal in Mikindani and he apologized…”
