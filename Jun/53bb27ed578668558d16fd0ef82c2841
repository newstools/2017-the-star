Multibillion-shilling projects and daily operations to be undertaken by the Coast Water Services Board could stall after a petitioner requested a court to freeze its two bank accounts.The projects are key to end water shortages. But Samuel Ensom says that CWSB and its directors are working in cahoots with new boss Jacob Kimutai, whose appointment as CEO is being challenged in court.He termed this a breach of the rule of law, accusing the board of secretly dishing out tenders for projects, whose value runs into billions.Ensom cites Lapsset (Sh350 million), Mwache Dam (Sh25 billion), Mzima (Sh38 billion), Garsen and Lamu (Sh27 billion) and Changamwe (Sh3 billion).The bank account numbers set to be frozen are 1107642426 and 1107641179 with the Kenya Commercial Bank.
