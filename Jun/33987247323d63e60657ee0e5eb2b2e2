Kakamega MCAs who have defaulted on mortgage and car loan repayment are plotting to extend the period to pay back the money.The MCAs held a kamukunji at the assembly on Wednesday and resolved to pass a motion extending the repayment period by two years.The meeting picked four members, Edward Shivembe, Florence Machio, Jane Eshuchi and Robert Bushuru, to draft the motion, which was set to be moved in the assembly yesterday afternoon. Bushuru chaired the meeting.&ldquo;The loans were given to us mid-term, which made it difficult to repay within the 32-month period they gave us,&rdquo; said Isukha West MCA Shivembe.&ldquo;There was no law to regulate car loans and mortgages then. We are in the process of making the law which has already gone through public participation.&rdquo;
