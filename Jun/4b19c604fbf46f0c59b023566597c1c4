It is a shame that about 5,000 pupils are out of school as a result of armed-bandit activity in parts of Rift Valley. The nation is actually just standing by as anti-social forces destroy the future of these children by denying them a chance to be at school due to insecurity. Does this mean the government is so helpless it cannot once and for all deal with the banditry menace? How long will the killings, displacement of innocent families and livestock theft, persist? People cannot continue living in IDP camps yet we have a government in place and it is peacetime. Government must immediately address the problem and ensure all these children out of school are safely back in class.The Kenya Police Air Wing needs to become much more than transport for senior officers, their families and guests. Banditry is terrestrial activity, bandits strike and escape mostly on foot. Rapid airborne responses by elite units such as the GSU would swiftly and seriously degrade bandits anywhere in Kenya.
