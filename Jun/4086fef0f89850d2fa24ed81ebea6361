Two Administration Police officers and two Machakos county inspectorate officers were killed instantly in an accident yesterday morning at Lukenya, on the Nairobi-Mombasa highway. The press secretary of the Machakos Governor, Mutinda Mwanzia, said the four were bodyguards attached to Alfred Mutua’s wife Lillian Nganga. He said the officers were travelling back to Machakos after dropping Nganga at her residence in Nairobi. “We pray to the Almighty God to comfort the families of our departed colleagues and give us all the strength to bear the loss,” Governor Mutua said. The guard’s car collided head-on with a Toyota Prado around 2am. Athi River police boss Sharma Wario said the driver of the Prado sustained serious injuries and was rushed to Mater Hospital, where he is receiving treatment. Wario said the cause of the accident has not been established, but initial investigations indicate the driver of the Prado was overtaking when he rammed into the county car. “We could not find an eye witness,” he said.
