Butali Warriors beat Chase Sailors 2-1 in the men&rsquo;s Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) Premier League mid-week at City Park Stadium, Nairobi on Wednesday.The victory saw the western-based side move to second place on the table with 28 points. The champions took the lead barely four minutes into the match through Constance Wakhavu. Titus Ngolia of Chase Sailors leveled the scores in the 36th minutes. Butalii came back breathing fire but Emmanuel Simiyu was denied two goals in the 39th and 43rd minutes respectively courtesy of Sailors&rsquo; keeper Collins Asumba&rsquo;s acrobatic saves. However, the Warriors upped the pressure and they were rewarded with the winner in the 46th minute through Vincent Odhiambo.Butali dominated the match despite the absence of their defender Brian Musasia who is out injured and Said Rashid who is out of the country due to work commitment.The Warriors captain Kenneth Nyongesa praised his team, saying the win was key as they seek to narrow the gap on the leaders. &ldquo;We played well. Winning this match is very vital as we are back in chasing the championship against the law enforces. We are going to go back training so that we win against them on Saturday,&rdquo; said Kenneth. &ldquo;Our side did their best. Our opponents were very good in the first quarter but after equalising we relaxed and they capitalised on that. We also wasted a lot of chances and open goals but all in all, it was a good game,&rdquo; said Chase Sailors&rsquo; coach William Oketch.The Butali&rsquo;s stand-in coach Dennis Awoka applauded his team but also said the real task lies ahead when they face Kenya Police on Saturday. &ldquo; The boys played well and it was exactly what we had planned. I advised them to pass the ball to tire our opponents and they did exactly that. Our next game against Police is not going to be easy but pressure will be on them because they are currently leading the league,&rdquo; said Awoka.
