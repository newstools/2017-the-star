The PNU candidate for Embu governor could be barred from the August 8 polls.The Constitutional Court nullified the controversial nomination exercise that handed Kithinji Kiragu the party ticket.The nomination was carried out hurriedly on May 7, and was boycotted by Kiragu&rsquo;s opponent, former Principal Secretary Cyrus Njiru, who claimed he was never informed of the exercise.Read: Chaos as Embu loser for governor seat rejects resultsPrincipal Judge Richard Mwongo quashed Kiragu&rsquo;s nomination on Friday because the exercise was in breach of the court&rsquo;s orders issued on May 5, 2017.&ldquo;Accordingly, the nominations were not legal and the outcome is hereby declared null and void,&rdquo; said Justice Mwongo.The court's decision is unlikely to have a major impact on the race because most polls consistently show Embu Governor Martin Wambora, the Jubilee candidate, would retain his seat if elections were held today.A recent poll by former Synovate executives, now working at Trends and Insights for Africa, shows Wambora leads as the most preferred governor candidate with 48 per cent followed by Senator Lenny Kivuti with 19 per cent and Kiragu with 11 per cent.However, Embu lawyer Leonard Nyaga said the ruling has already dented Kiragu&rsquo;s already flailing bid.More on this: Wambora still the favourite in Embu governor raceThe ruling comes after an appeal filed by four voters, Denis Mugendi, Jeremiah Mugambi, Patrick Muchira and Simon Njue, who sought nullification of nomination exercise citing contempt of court.The four named Kiragu, Peter Kabera and PNU as respondents in the case.Some PNU supporters held a small demonstration in Embu Town to protest the ruling.
