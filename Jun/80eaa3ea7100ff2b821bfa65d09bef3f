The High Court has declined to suspend the ballot papers printing awarded to Dubai firm Al Ghurair and asked the CJ to form a bench to hear the case.Justice George Odunga ruled on Friday that NASA failed to convince the court that the temporary orders were necessary.Odunga ordered that the file be immediately taken to Chief Justice David Maraga so he can constitute a three-judge bench to hear the dispute on Tuesday.Lawyers representing the IEBC, Al Ghurair, the AG and other interested parties had put up a spirited fight for the court not to suspend the contract at this stage. The general election will take place on August 8.The lawyers informed the court that they required time to respond to issues raised by the Opposition before any orders are issued.They said they had just received the suit papers following a ruling by Odunga on Thursday."The court should not make an order that may frustrate or prevent the holding of elections as scheduled," said a lawyer representing the electoral commission.NASA pushed for the temporary orders saying the court should allow it to argue its application first.The judge further agreed that Jubilee Party and the Third-Way Alliance should be enjoined to the case as interested parties.Opposition leader Raila Odinga said on Wednesday they will block the Sh2.5 billion tender awarded to the firm."Presidential ballot papers have already been printed despite protest by the Opposition," he said.But IEBC said the papers are yet to be processed adding that the printing will start next month.More on this: NASA files suit challenging Al Ghurair ballot papers tenderAlso read: IEBC won't cancel Al Ghurair tender, NASA free to boycott poll - ChebukatiEarly this month, IEBC awarded the tender after a protracted legal battle mounted by the opposition.The coalition claims President Uhuru Kenyatta has close ties with Al Ghurair owners.
