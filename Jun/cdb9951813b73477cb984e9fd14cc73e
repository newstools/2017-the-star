The Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital has cancelled the suspension of five nurses&rsquo; officials who had been accused of organising the ongoing strike.The suspension was rescinded on Friday.&ldquo;We are engaging in dialogue to resolve the issues raised by the nurses,&rdquo; CEO Wilson Aruasa said.He said they have made progress in efforts to end the strike, which enters its fifth day today.At least 1,000 nurses went on strike last Thursday, demanding the implementation of a 2015 CBA.Nurses&rsquo; union national trustee Charles Alisoreng said the hospital should not intimidate officials.&ldquo;We want our CEO to engage us in genuine dialogue to resolve the issues. It&rsquo;s not good to intimidate workers who are picketing to demand their rights as provided for in law,&rdquo; he said.The union has refused to call off the strike until its members&rsquo; demands are met.The 2015 CBA raises their salaries and allowances. Alisoreng asked patients to seek services in other hospitals.Chairman Kennedy Orangi said the nurses have ran out of patience. &ldquo;We are sorry for the public that we have been forced to strike instead of serving them,&rdquo; he said.
