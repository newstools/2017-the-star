Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya has said his differences with Mumias East MP Ben Washiali originated from sugar politics.Speaking in Sabatia market on Wednesday, Oparanya said he differed with Washiali after he dissuaded President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto from transferring the state&rsquo;s 20 per cent shareholding in the company to the county government.&ldquo;I asked Uhuru and Ruto about the government stake and they agreed, but Washiali campaigned against the proposal until they went slow and retain the shares to date. That is where my problem with Washiali began,&rdquo; he said.Oparanya said he then asked that the state allows the county to have two directors on the company board, which the legislator again opposed.But Washiali denied Oparanya&rsquo;s claims. He said the governor should use the Sh200 million the county government paid to a private company to purchase shares in Mumias if he wants the county to have a stake.Governor can buy shares if he wants&ldquo;Mumias share is currently 85 cents on the stock exchange. Oparanya can buy more than the 20 per cent state shareholding in the company using the Sh200 million. Mumias is a listed private company,&rdquo; he said.Oparanya was in Sabatia to commission the new Sabatia bus park.In November 2016, Washiali confronted and roughed up Oparanya in Shibale, Mumias town.Oparanya had accompanied ODM leader Raila Odinga to Mumias to protest against the use of excessive force by GSU officers when they were searching for several rifles that were stolen from a police station in Mumias.&lsquo;Using Mumias firm to seek votes&rsquo;Yesterday, Washiali asked Oparanya to stop using Mumias woes to seek reelection when he did nothing to help revive it.&ldquo;The Sh200 million he said he gave to Mumias was given to Mumias Distributors Limited and not Mumias Sugar Company. He should tell us what the money did,&rdquo; he said.But Oparanya blamed Washiali for being responsible for the problems Mumias is facing. He accused Washiali and top Jubilee leaders of turning the company into a cash cow to get campaign money.&ldquo;They pretend to give money to Mumias but follow at night and demand the same for campaigns. When Uhuru and Ruto brought the first Sh1 billion to Mumias I told them that was a drop in the ocean as the company requires more than Sh12 billion to return to normalcy,&rdquo; the governor said.Washiali accused Oparanya of licensing the Shikunga weigh bridge in Butere constituency by a rival &mdash; Kibos Sugar Company in Nyanza &mdash; to facilitate cane poaching that has caused an acute shortage of cane at Mumias Sugar.
