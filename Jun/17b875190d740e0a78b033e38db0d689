Kasipul MP and Homa Bay governor hopeful Oyugi Magwanga will now use a chopper to cover more ground during his campaigns.He said, &ldquo;Time is running out fast and we need to reach as many residents as possible so they support my candidature in this election.&rdquo;Addressing residents at the Homa Bay County Stadium on Sunday, Magwanga said local and international professionals donated the chopper.&ldquo;In fact, they gave me two choppers and the other will be here soon,&rdquo; he said. Magwanga, who will run as an independent, denied any association with Jubilee Party.He told his supporters to treat as propaganda, claims he has links with Jubilee.&ldquo;Until I went independent, I was the county ODM party secretary. Propagandists associate me with Jubilee Party because they messed up the ODM nominations,&rdquo; Magwanga said.He urged his opponents to conduct issue-based campaigns and sell their agenda to voters.Magwanga slammed calls by the ODM Nyanza presidential campaign team to residents to accept the six-piece vote system.&ldquo;You should vote for individuals. There are candidates who hide behind six-piece since they don&rsquo;t have any development record to show the people,&rdquo; he said.Magwanga&rsquo;s use of a chopper has been criticised by ODM candidate and incumbent Governor Cyprian Awiti.Awiti questioned how, &ldquo;suddenly&rdquo;, Magwanga could start campaigning using a chopper, yet he claims he is at the same level with poor residents.&ldquo;The adoption of a plane clearly indicates how my opponent is a hypocrite. Let him fly high and leave for us the voters on the ground,&rdquo; he said during a rally in Kibiri, Karachuonyo constituency.Awiti told Magwanga to prepare for a resounding defeat on August 8.He said he will not use a chopper during his campaigns. &ldquo;I conduct peaceful door-to-door campaigns and the majority of you have assured me of your support, so he should prepare to retire,&rdquo; Awiti said. He said using a chopper does not necessarily translate into votes.&ldquo;The same method never worked during the Homa Bay senatorial by-election in 2015. The ODM candidate won aircraft users,&rdquo; Awiti said.
