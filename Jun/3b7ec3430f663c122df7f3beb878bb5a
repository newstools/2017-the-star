NASA flag bearer Raila Odinga was forced to cut short his tour of Rarieda after youths allied to ODM and Independents clashed. He left for Bondo following the chaos that erupted at the grounds in Nicholas Gumbo's backyard where the NASA brigade was supposed to hold a rally. Police were forced to lob teargas to disperse youths allied to Gumbo who were chanting slogans against former Ombudsman chair Otiende Amolo. Amolo beat Neto Adhola in the Rarieda ODM MP primaries and has since been cleared as the Orange party's candidate in the August 8 polls. The irate youths pelted stones and chairs at each other forcing those who had thronged the venue in wait for Raila to scamper for safety. Gumbo, who has been Rarieda MP since 2007, is vying against Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga as an independent candidate.
