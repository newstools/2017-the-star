Even if one or two of the early meetings President Uhuru Kenyatta had with the proprietors and directors of Dubai-based Al Ghurair Printing &amp; Publishing may have been completely blameless, meeting them at State House, Nairobi, in October last year does not look good.The President needs to be seen to be doing the right thing at all times.He and his handlers ought to have known who the delegation was and what they did, which included transacting with the IEBC in the provision of by-election ballot papers since at least 2013.The President is briefed on all delegations that he meets, and what each and every individual does.Even if there was a larger Chamber of Commerce delegation present, being photographed with the Al Ghurair Printing &amp; Publishing directors was setting himself up for future trouble and misinterpretation. This is exactly what has now transpired as the photographs record a private meeting at State House.The hullabaloo surrounding this encounter is something the President and his protocol/communications teams should have foreseen.
