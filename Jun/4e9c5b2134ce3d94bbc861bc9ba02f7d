Anti-FGM crusader Linah Kilimo was yesterday cleared to run for the Marakwet East parliamentary seat at the August 8 polls. Running as an independent, Kilimo will face three other candidates in the race. She said she quit Jubilee Party due to pressure from constituents who urged her to run as an independent after losing to incumbent Kangogo Bowen in the JP primaries. Kilimo was addressing her supporters at Chesoi trading centre after receiving her clearance certificate from the IEBC. Kilimo said the JP nominations were marred by irregularities.&ldquo;The exercise in Marakwet East was shambolic,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;People asked me to vie because of my good development track record when I served as their MP between 2003-12.&rdquo; During her reign as MP, she led a spirited campaign to end banditry and cattle rustling between the Pokot and the Marakwet communities. Kilimo will faceoff with Bowen (JP), Sawachan Kinur (independent) and Jonah Cherutich of ODM.
