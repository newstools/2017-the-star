Garissa Governor Nathif Jama has hit out at Garissa leaders, accusing them of being uncommitted to peaceful election campaigns.He said many aspirants talk of the need for harmony, but their actions betray them. This was in reference to the Madaraka Day celebrations when the county&rsquo;s governor, Senate, woman representative and MP aspirants skipped the function.Jama said the fete provided a perfect opportunity for the politicians to lead by example and show that they mean what they say.&ldquo;I was surprised that even the most respected politicians in this county deliberately skipped such an important national event. They may have issues with my administration, but the Constitution supersedes all our interests,&rdquo; the irritated county chief said.&ldquo;We are peace-loving Kenyans and have used all our forums to preach peace and unite the people of Garissa. This is evident for the past four years we have been in office &mdash; Garissa has been peaceful.&rdquo;Jama challenged county commissioner James Kianda and his security team to convene a meeting to have all aspirants commit to promoting peace.&ldquo;Elections will come and go, but the people of Garissa will remain. This notion that politics is a matter of life and death is a myth that needs to be demystified,&rdquo; he said.The incumbent will face JP&rsquo;s Ali Korane, who lost by a slim margin in 2013. Jama is running on the Wiper ticket.The two have never met in any forum and the closest they have come was when President Uhuru Kenyatta visited Garissa in February while on a voter education drive &mdash; Korane attended as a JP honcho and Jama as the county boss.
