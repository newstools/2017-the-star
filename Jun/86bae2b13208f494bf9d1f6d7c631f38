A voter wants Murang&rsquo;a Governor Mwangi Wairia barred from running for public office &ldquo;because he fails the integrity test&rdquo;.Jackson Kiroko Ndegwa says Wairia has unresolved issues touching on his integrity and it would be only right to clear them first before he is allowed to defend his seat. Wairia faces a probe over corruption but has not been charged before any court of law.Ndegwa says allowing the governor to participate in the election before the issues are settled is unconstitutional and insensitive to leadership and integrity requirements.He said, &ldquo;The application and the petitioner seek to breath life into leadership and integrity standards by halting any further blatant and unconstitutional processing of candidature and probable assumption of office.&rdquo;
