Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong was in talks with Marachi elders over his choice of running mate way before Busia Deputy Governor Kizito Wangalwa resigned. Ojaamong on Thursday named Moses Mulomi as his new running mate a day after Wangalwa stepped down. "My people at home called me last Saturday saying 'Musa' the elders want to see you in Nairobi to be briefed on what is going on. It is true when I called they confirmed it. Elders from Bukhayo, Samia and Bunyala also appended their signature," Mulomi said.He spoke during their first rally at Ojaamong's home in Okilidu on Thursday. Wangalwa withdrew on Wednesday, saying Ojaamong was free to choose anyone for the position."The rumour that I have been dumped or sacked is now water under the bridge...I have given the clarification. I will comfortably execute my mandate until I hand over to the next DG," he said.Ojaamong said they are targetting more than 200,000 votes. "On top of that we shall elect Raila but for MCAs I give the voters freedom to elect the people they want," he said.Ojaamong said Wangalwa will be the main beneficiary if he supports his government.
