Nakuru Governor Kinuthia Mbugua&rsquo;s &lsquo;troubled&rsquo; administration pushed him into early retirement.Residents say stalled projects such as ECDE classes, deplorable roads, lack of water and runaway corruption cost him a second term as governor.They accused him of doing little in development four years after devolution was implemented and say there is nothing to celebrate.Mbugua says he was wrongly accused by his rivals.The administration has received slightly more than Sh40 billion from the national government for the past five years. It also collected an annual average of Sh2.5 billion as internal revenue. But residents say numerous failures prompted them to vote him out during the JP primaries.Mbugua lost to former MP Lee Kinyanjui. He&rsquo;s not defending the seat.Resident Martin Mwangi said the county lacked capital investment and Mbugua&rsquo;s whirlwind tours abroad did not yield a single flagship project.Resident Jane Cherotich said his indecisiveness in cracking the whip on graft also contributed to his poor showing in the nominations.Mbugua is also on the spot for spending Sh70 million on Afraha Stadium upgrade ahead of hosting President Uhuru Kenyatta at the facility last year. This is said have been done without the approval of the county assembly,as required by law.County Assembly Budget and Appropriation Committee chairman Ndung&rsquo;u Kamau said in a report that the county boss did not seek clearance from the assembly.It has also emerged that the procurement procedures were not adhered to in the award of the tender.Mbugua is also accused of failing to confront illegal hiring of staff, said to have gobbled up billions of shillings of taxpayers&rsquo; money.At least 70 per cent of the funds from the national government goes to salaries &mdash; the county has a bloated workforce of more than 7,000 workers.An ad hoc committee set up by speaker Susan Kihika revealed massive rot in the employment process.At least 200 workers were illegally employed and the committee recommended the sacking of county secretary Joseph Mogusu Motari and chief officer Philip Sigei &mdash; Mbugua never implemented the directive.Some residents feel his administration, particularly the executive committee, was dominated by two communities &mdash; the Kikuyus and Kalenjins.The NCIC and human rights activists say the county of focussed on dominant tribes while ignoring other tribes, resulting in skewed employment.Minority groups have been excluded from decision-making and allocation of resources, they said. &ldquo;They have not been fairly represented as required by law,&rdquo; said the County Ethnic Audits in 2014.Mbugua&rsquo;s notable feat was the removal of hawkers from Nakuru&rsquo;s CBD, but the brutal manner in which it was done put him at odds with traders.
