Kitui Senator David Musila has said comments he supports President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s reelection were taken out of context.On Sunday, the senator asked the youth to back the President based on his record.&ldquo;Vote for me as an independent candidate, elect Uhuru without minding his party,&rdquo; Musila said as he campaigned with Kitui West MP Francis Nyenze.But on Monday, Musila said he was misquoted by &ldquo;unknown forces&rdquo;.&ldquo;I did not endorse Uhuru, in fact, I did not endorse anyone. I have made it very clear I am an independent candidate...I am not supporting Jubilee or anyone,&rdquo; he said during an interview on Citizen TV.He said he does not support any candidate ahead of the elections but noted that NASA should not reject the independent candidates.Raila rallied his supporters to reject independents at the ballot saying the party needed numerical strength in both Houses of Parliament."Usually I would support Jubilee Party...I mean NASA....because people know NASA here," Musila added.He and Nyenze have become increasingly critical of Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka.Musila ditched Wiper party after he was floored in the Kitui governor's race. He lost to incumbent Julius Malombe in the results announced. Malombe garnered 88,382 votes while the latter got 74,308.Shortly after Kalonzo was named Raila's running mate, Nyenze came out saying Kalonzo will go it alone, a remark that Wiper leaders have distanced themselves from.
