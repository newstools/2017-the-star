Bill has just informed me that the reason I have been kidnapped is because I owe money to someone. He didn&rsquo;t elaborate further. I must assume it&rsquo;s one of my blackmail victims. He has handed me a box. Inside is a black lace bodysuit. It has a plunging neckline, detailed with a white crochet trim. &ldquo;The first client will be here tonight,&rdquo; Bill has told me. &ldquo;He is the one that likes a clean canvas. We sent him your picture and he is satisfied, despite the small scar you blamed on my colleague.&rdquo;By client he means some sadistic psycho who will get pleasure from inflicting pain on me. Oh no, please, no. Have I actually been sold into sex slavery? NO!!! Bill has also made it clear that these clients think I&rsquo;m here willingly and there will be consequences if I say otherwise. It doesn&rsquo;t matter. I&rsquo;m not sticking around to find out. Hell no! It&rsquo;s just Bill here now. If I almost escaped with two of them guarding me, my chances will be much higher now that he&rsquo;s alone. &ldquo;Clean sheets. I&rsquo;d like you to bring me clean sheets,&rdquo; I say. He raises a quizzical brow. &ldquo;You said anything for me to be comfortable,&rdquo; I tell him. &ldquo;For the client.&rdquo;He nods and leaves the room. He returns 10 minutes later with a fresh pair of sheets.&ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo; he asks.&ldquo;No. Just a few hours of uninterrupted sleep,&rdquo; I say. &rdquo;I didn&rsquo;t get much of that last night.&rdquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wake you up when he&rsquo;s on his way,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Samantha?&rdquo; he turns to me when he reaches the door.&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; I ask.&ldquo;Take the drugs. It will help,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;What do you have?&rdquo; I ask.&ldquo;Whatever you want. Weed. Coke. Heroin. LSD.&rdquo;&ldquo;Can I think about it?&rdquo; I ask.&ldquo;Ya, sure. Let me know after your nap,&rdquo; Bill answers and locks the door behind me.Drugs. Is this guy serious? He must forget what I do for a living. As a journalist, I&rsquo;m well aware that the first thing sex traffickers do is try and get you addicted to some mind-altering substance. When you are an addict, you are easy to control because you will do anything for your next hit. That&rsquo;s why most prostitutes are junkies. I also know that they have no intention of ever letting me go.The UN has estimates putting the yearly value of the human trafficking industry at $32 billion dollars. That makes it the third-largest criminal industry on earth, behind guns and drugs. People who do this don&rsquo;t do it because some random girl like me hustled a couple of million from someone. People do it because they are part of a multi billion-dollar criminal industry. The biggest misconception people have about prostitution is that it&rsquo;s willing buyer, willing seller. But the reality is that in most cases, someone is making that money &ndash; and it&rsquo;s not the woman you are paying for sex. It&rsquo;s a pimp or trafficker. Think about that the next time you pick up a prostitute on the roadside. You are contributing to the growth of an industry where a young woman, most likely against her will and under the threat of her life, sells her body to you. That makes you the problem. Demand and supply. Meanwhile, they know I&rsquo;m pregnant. Or at least I assume they do, if they have been told as much by whoever brought me here. So what&rsquo;s the plan? Have me carry to full term and put my baby into the programme, too? Did I mention that this multi billion-dollar industry makes more money off child trafficking than women? Yes, there are many sick perverts out there happy to molest children. Even babies&hellip;
