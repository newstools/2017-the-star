Ravi Chana is brimming with confidence ahead of this year&rsquo;s Kenya Airways East African Safari Classic Rally, in which he will once again partner with renowned Tanzanian rally driver, Jayant Shah.While Ravi is a highly experienced navigator, with substantial rally mileage posted in the last two decades, he acknowledges there is always something to learn when sitting next to one of African rallying&rsquo;s most experienced competitors. Ravi is also conscious for the seat that he now fills. The seat was previously occupied by the great Lofty Drews, who was part of Safari Rally history, thanks to his victory alongside Shekhar Mehta in 1973. &ldquo;Calling the tulips where Lofty once sat gives me great pride,&rdquo; says Ravi. &ldquo;When the Safari Classic going gets tough, thoughts of Lofty help me to endure this nine-day adventure. Jayant may now be in his seventies, but his record speaks for itself. I have enjoyed every minute of our partnership, especially in the Tanzanian championship. There is always a thing or two to learn from the old guard.&rdquo;Though the Shah/Chana partnership was formed many years ago, it was not until 2015 that a space on Safari Classic opened up next to Shah. Lofty had decided to call time on the Classic, an event he f described as &lsquo;an adventure before dementia&rsquo;. Having won the 2WD navigator&rsquo;s title in Tanzania alongside Jayant in 2013, Nairobi-based Chana was the obvious choice for the vacancy. Young Ravi was mentored by his father, an accomplished rally driver, the late Kulwant Singh Chana, before making his rally debut in the 1991 Guru Nanak. Though Chana&rsquo;s competitive outings are currently confined to Kenya and Tanzania.
