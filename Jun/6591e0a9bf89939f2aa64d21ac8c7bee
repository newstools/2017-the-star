More than 400 Jubilee losers in DP William Ruto's Uasin Gishu backyard have threatened to withdraw support for candidates in the party.Their threat arose from a dispute over the list of politicians proposed for nomination.Those who lost in the primaries claim those proposed are the girlfriends and relatives of party officials powerful politicians in the region. &ldquo;We cannot accept the list that is full of mipango ya kando (girlfriends) and friends of some people yet those of us who worked for the party, and even paid nomination fees, have been left out," said spokesman Phillip Chebunet.Chebunet said the losers should have been considered and that they will go to court if the proposed names are not withdrawn and a fresh list agreed upon.They also want President Uhuru Kenyatta and Ruto to intervene.&ldquo;If they don&rsquo;t consider our grievances, we will withdraw our support for party candidates and advise our supporters to make different decisions," said Chebunet who wants to be Moiben MP.He addressed the press in Eldoret on Tuesday, accompanied by aspirants including Daniel Kemei, Nancy Chepsiya and Abraham Mutwol.On Sunday, Governor Jackson Mandago said he added three names of Muslims to the list of those to be nominated.The politicians said Jubilee officials in the area, led by chairman Sammy Ruto, were to blame.Mutwol said they are also angry about being sidelined during campaigns in the region by the President and DP.&ldquo;We were ignored yet the President and DP asked that we back the so-called Jubilee winners during the primaries. We will withdraw the support because it&rsquo;s like we are not needed," he said.He noted they paid a total of Sh45 million ahead of the primaries and that it is unfair for strangers to be taking centre stage in Jubilee matters.The chairman denied the claim that the nominees list is of politicians' girlfriends and relatives.The President held a meeting with Jubilee Party aspirants from Uasin Gishu and Trans Nzoia counties on June 11. Uhuru urged them to rally their supporters to turn up in large numbers to vote on election day.More on this: Uhuru meets Uasin Gishu, Trans Nzoia candidates as vote hunt intensifiesAlso read: Ruto meets Mandago, allies to quell political tensions ahead of Uhuru's visit
