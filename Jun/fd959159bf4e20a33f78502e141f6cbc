The government will have to add more tablets in schools for the digital literacy programme. ICT Authority director Jerome Ochieng said more pupils need the devices. He said the first batch released to the pilot schools were not enough and there is need for more. Ochieng said he has received complaints from schools that the inadequacy hurts the programme. &ldquo;This is a complaint I have received in nearly all the schools I have visited in Kisumu. The pupils are many and the devices are few. I will advise the government on this, with a view to adding more devices,&rdquo; he said on Friday at Muhoroni Factory Primary School, Kisumu county. Ochieng said teachers will also be trained further to improve the programme. &ldquo;Teachers were trained on how to handle this programme, but I think there should be more training to build their capacity on digital literacy,&rdquo; he said. Ochieng is set to visit all Kisumu schools that benefitted.
