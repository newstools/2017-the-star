In its current issue, Africa Confidential, the fortnightly UK-based newsletter that has focussed on analysing politics and economics in Africa since 1960, has the following sub-heading on its story about the presidential campaign in Kenya, &ldquo;Opposition and government are outbidding each other with their spending promises amid signs of electoral disillusionment&rdquo;.Both President Uhuru Kenyatta of the ruling Jubilee Party and the opposition NASA&rsquo;s candidate Raila Odinga now promise the same thing if either wins: Free secondary school education. This is an idea that has enormous feel-good factors, but is it really practicable?Neither candidate has told Kenyans how this fine-sounding pledge will be rolled out, where the money will come from and how it might affect other education funding.The Free Primary Education programme has been marred by a lot of challenges over the years, especially in the all-important release of funds. The purchasing and maintenance of textbooks has also been a headache.Could both main contenders tell the electorate how they intend to ensure that the money for free secondary education serves the intended purpose?
