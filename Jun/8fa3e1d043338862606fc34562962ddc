Wajir Jubilee governor candidate Mohamed Mahamud is fighting off claims of a dubious degree allegedly obtained from a foreign university.With only 43 days to the August 8 General Election, the former Kenyan Ambassador to Saudi Arabia says he was properly awarded a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Business Administration by Kampala University.Mahamud said he graduated on March 1, 2012.&ldquo;This is sheer propaganda by my opponent who has panicked because he has been isolated by the electorate in Wajir,&rdquo; Mahamud told the Star yesterday.Documents obtained by the Star show the Jubilee governor aspirant was not in the graduation booklet of March 1, 2012. The booklet is a pre-graduation publication confirming the list of graduands.The School of Business and Management presented a list of 72 graduands for the award of a degree in Business Administration but Mahamud&rsquo;s name is missing. A list of graduands also published in a local daily on February 22, 2012 ahead of the graduation does not have his name. Asked about this anomaly Mahamud said, &ldquo;I have my degree with me, that is all I can say.&rdquo;Mahamud has been cleared by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission as the bona fide Jubilee candidate for the Wajir governor race.He is seeking to unseat incumbent Ahmed Abdullahi of ODM in a county where political choices are largely influenced by clans and elders. Last week, some Wajir MPs accused Abdullahi of masterminding Mahamud&rsquo;s troubles for political mileage.Eldas MP Adan Keynan said the governor sponsored Abdirahman Abdille to lodge a case in Uganda against Mahamud over fake academic certificates.Abdille, an ODM MCA aspirant in Wajir county, later admitted that his particulars were forged to facilitate the filing of the case.&ldquo;My ID number was used but the signature is not mine,&rdquo; he said. Abdullahi has distanced himself from the case challenging his rival&rsquo;s degree, saying he is focusing on his reelection.
