Kenyans love giving their political opinions. That is why when they saw a photo of President Uhuru Kenyatta and popular Luhya musician Emmanuel Musundi, they were quick to comment.Nicholas Mmaitsi: You guys you don't know what Emmanuel Musindi is going through currently. This guy has been hospitalized for the last six months, hospital bill raised up to 2.5m. Nobody was willing to bail him out....but this gentleman has done the magic!!!! #givecreditwhereisdue.Musasia Peter: Boss, hata ukaleta Tindikiti band, Phonotex, Emmanuel Shisia, Webuye Juakali band, and all Luhya musicians, votes as western hupati ng'o. August you're going home. Ndakhabhola khandi dhakhamala. Silvia Okoth: Mr President has done nothing wrong....this was a wake-up call..musindi needed help...and there Mr President was there to give him a shoulder to lean on. 2.5m...as a hospital bill..na hakuna yeyote alie jitolea kumpa msaada, juu President ameitikia wito..mnaanza matusi..story zenye hazina maana. Wacha penye, uzuri pasifiwe bana!
