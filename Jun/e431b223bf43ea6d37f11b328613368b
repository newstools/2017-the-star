At least 8,000 shareholders of the controversial Mboi Kamiti Landbuying Company in Kiambu county have breathed a sigh of relief after being handed plots as the firm, founded in 1971, winds up.The shareholders received their allotment letters last Friday from chairman Thuo Mathenge. The company has been embroiled a land ownership tussle which led to a series of murders and the sale of some parcels. &ldquo;I am very happy to finally get my share in Mboi Kamiti. For 40 years, I only had a share certificate. We were taken round in circles by directors who have come and gone after looting the firm,&rdquo; 70-year-old shareholder Mary Gathoni said.Since the firm&rsquo;s inception, farmhands who worked at white settlers&rsquo; farms bought shares at Sh500 each and used the money to buy huge chunks of land across the country.Leadership wrangles led to vicious confrontations and six directors and a chairman were killed in cold blood. Other officials, including accountants and lawyers, have also faced the same fate. The current chairman - Thuo Mathenge - is also a victim of attempted murder.He was accosted by armed thugs in 2011 as he entered his home in Tigoni, Limuru, and his vehicle was sprayed with bullets. Mathenge yesterday said, &ldquo;It is by the grace of God that I survived the attack. It is now a new dawn as shareholders have gotten their land.&rdquo;He added, &ldquo;This is the end of Mboi Kamiti. The allotment letters bear the names of the shareholders, not the company. Now the shareholders are plot owners and this marks the end of the wrangles which brought down the once giant company.&rdquo;Shareholders have been allocated either an eighth or quarter of an acre depending on the number of shares they had. They have been allocated land in Twiga, Matropi, Kiora and Anmer estates.
