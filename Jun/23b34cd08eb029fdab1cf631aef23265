Seventy-six ex-Air Force soldiers jailed over the 1982 attempted coup have filed a petition, demanding compensation from the government.They come from Bungoma, Busia, Trans Nzoia, Kakamega and Vihiga counties.The ex-soldiers jointly submitted the petition before Justice Maureen Onyango at the Kisumu Industrial Court on Thursday. They said some of them were victims of the circumstances and were not part of the attempted coup.The group urged the Jubilee administration to implement the Truth Justice and Reconciliation Commission Report recommendations. In their petition, they requested the government to compensate them full retirement benefits and damages for wrongful dismissal from work. In the petition they also raised complaints of torture, inhuman treatment, brutal arrests and wrongful detention.Pascal Baraza said they have visited many offices, including that of the TJRC, but they have not been helped. &ldquo;We discussed these issues with the TJRC and until now, we are yet to get any positive response from the government.Job Kipkemboi questioned why their head, General Peter Kariuki, was awarded Sh37 million, but they did not receive anything.In March 2014, the Court of Appeal ruled that Kariuki&rsquo;s constitutional rights and freedoms were violated when he was arrested, sacked from the forces, tried before a court martial, jailed for four years and stripped of his rank as Commander of the Kenya Air Force.
