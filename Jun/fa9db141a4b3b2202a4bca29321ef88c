The government has allocated Sh320 million for the purchase of chemicals for spraying maize farms invaded by armyworm in Uasin Gishu, Kakamega and Trans Nzoia counties.Agriculture CS Willy Bett yesterday said the ministry will educate farmers on how to use the chemicals. He, however, added that the Sh320 million will only support vulnerable farmers who can&rsquo;t afford to buy the chemicals.&ldquo;This is a fall armyworm, which is unique in Africa. It has only been present in South America. Handling it is different from how we handle the other armyworm,&rdquo; Bett said.Farmers have grappled with how to deal with the fall armyworm due to its nocturnal behaviour.The highly destructive worm hides in maize leaves during daytime and only becomes active at night.Some farmers resorted to desperate measures such as pouring paraffin on maize stems after discovering that the worms were resistant to even the strongest herbicides in the market.Bett said they consulted with stakeholders, including chemical manufacturers, on the best way to deal with the problem.&ldquo;We zeroed in on a number [of chemicals] and communicated the same to farmers so they know which chemical to go for,&rdquo; he said.
