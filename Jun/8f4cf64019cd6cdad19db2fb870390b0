The one-and-a-half-month old infant who on Saturday &lsquo;came back to life&rsquo; moments before she was laid to rest is now dead and buried.The baby was said to have died three days ago after a sudden illnessArea chief Bendetta Musyoka said the baby died on Saturday evening in hospital and was laid to rest on Sunday.Mourners who attended the baby&rsquo;s burial ceremony in Mbondoni village, Mwingi, on Saturday said after the prayers were over, some women were asked to dress and collect the body of the young one for burial, in keeping with the community&rsquo;s culture.But when they touched the baby&rsquo;s body, they realised it was warm, and after a short while the infant coughed, much to the disbelief of the women.It is alleged the baby had been confirmed dead and was being preserved at her home using a traditional technique.A relative of the family, Major Mbenga, had said the family would have to plant a banana tree in the grave after the baby &lsquo;resurrected&rsquo; in accordance with the Kamba culture, to prevent unexpected deaths in their lineage. But this did not last long because the infant was buried in the grave which had been prepared, and the trunk uprooted. Musyoka said residents are still in shock. When news that the baby &lsquo;had come back to life&rsquo; reached the mourners on Saturday, some vanished, while others remained in the compound to confirm the truth. Mwenga said the ceremony ended abruptly after mourners abandoned the homestead. He said he also could not believe the baby had come back to life, and moreso minutes before she was buried. Mwenga said after the baby &lsquo;resurrected&rsquo; she was taken to a private hospital in Mwingi where she died.Medics who took care of the infact did not comment on the claims of &lsquo;resurrection&rsquo; and treated the baby the way they would any patient.
