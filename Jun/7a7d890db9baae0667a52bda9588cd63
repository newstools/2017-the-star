Jubilee Kitui West MP candidate Ben Mbai is optimistic he will beat incumbent Francis Nyenze.He is banking on his track record of supporting education by sponsoring needy students.Mbai said times are changing and voters are breaking away from the tradition of supporting parties, rather than candidates.He said, &ldquo;Today, even though the party might have various names, people are clearly aware parties are not really the focus in terms of development. They have realised from experience that electing people based on parties can lead to poor development.&rdquo;Mbai said, &ldquo;I have distinguished myself as being development conscious and there is evidence.&rdquo;He said he has educated about 500 needy students from secondary school, through university.Mbai said he started engaging in community development when he was still in school.
