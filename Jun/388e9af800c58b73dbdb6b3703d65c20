Five Kenya Pipeline volleyball team players are expected to link up with the national women&rsquo;s under 23 side today on non-residential training at Nyayo Stadium.Left hitter Edna Mwombe, setter Veronica Tanui, libero Cellestine Nyongesa, middle blockers Beldine Akinyi and Yvonne Snaida are set to be released today by their club and reigning national champions Kenya Pipeline.The team under the tutelage of coach Catherine Mabwi commenced preparations last week for the FIVB under 23 World Championships slated for September 10-18 in Ljubljana and Maribor, Slovenia without the five. Mabwi said their late arrival has in a way affected the training programme but she is grateful they are finally joining the team.&ldquo;It was a little difficult when I&rsquo;d planned for 19 players then only 14 turn up. But I am not too worried because they have been training with their club. We only hope they will jell well with the rest of the team, since we have newcomers in our midst,&rdquo; said Mabwi. The lineup had over five months to train ahead of the continental qualifiers held in Nairobi in October 2016 where the Kenya side finished second behind Egypt. &ldquo;I will only get disturbed when the girls fail to jell in good time. This time round we have little time to prepare for the tournament,&rdquo; said Mabwi.Matters have further been complicated for the junior volleyball squad as they can only gain access the Kasarani Indoor gymnasium after the IAAF World Under 18 athletics Championships in July.
