Citizen TV's Willis Raburu surprised many after he married his longtime girlfriend Mary Ngami in an invite-only wedding in Runda. Photos of his nuptials were posted on social media by his close friends. No one saw it coming. The two kept their relationship tightly under wraps."Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to introduce my wife, Mrs Raburu," he shared after their wedding. His wife is a writer, fashionista and a staunch Christian. Raburu is happily married and he recently landed a new job at Hot 96. He hosts Rhythm Junction show alongside Terry Muikamba from midday to 2pm on weekdays. "It's about inspiration and aspiration. And playing the hits," he said.The talented media personality has embarked on a fitness journey after he was trolled online for being overweight."I have partnered with USN Kenya trainer Evelyn Owala and I'm working on losing 20kgs in four months. It's not that easy. At times I want to give up but I push myself," says the famous 10over10 host.Raburu, who has been a victim of cyberbullying, says he has learnt to 'ignore trolls' and move on with life. Apart from his weight, he was also attacked for marrying from a different tribe, a clear indication that tribalism is still alive. "A Kikuyu? Ok congratulations," a Twitter follower asked Raburu."Ngoja ukamuliwe uishe wacha vile umenona hapo soon you will be Eric Omondi," another one commented.
