ARE President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy an increasingly worried lot in the bid to defend their seats? It seems voter apathy is becoming a harsh reality in the duo's Mt Kenya stronghold and they are trying to hold on to anything to address the problem. Their move, for instance, to revive the old 2013 ICC gimmicks on Monday during their Nandi rally hasn't worked as they expected. It seems the two leaders are keen on using the old gimmick to whip up emotions in Mt Kenya for voters to turn out in large numbers as they did at the last polls. Word has it that a senior Jubilee Party operative among the Mbele Iko Sawa campaigns team in the region and neighbouring counties was heard lamenting to his colleagues that reigniting and riding on the dead ICC issue is akin to arousing the emotions of the dead.**********A top Jubilee Party point man and former party leader before the parties were merged is the talk of the region. Reason? Word has it that this man has included the names of his mpango wa kando and best friend on the nomination list of JP's representation in the county assembly after the August polls. His move has shocked many party supporters, especially some devoted members who lost in the primaries but are still selling the party in the opposition stronghold. Some aggrieved members who were keen on being nominated are now considering quitting the party - and supporting NASA.**********POLICE in Chuka have been reluctant to arrest and prosecute a woman who has thrice in a week attempted to burn down her estranged husband's house and instead are asking the man to reconcile with the woman. The woman, who doused the house in petrol and set it ablaze the first time, destroyed all doors the next day and demolished a wall, but has not been prosecuted, despite all the incidents being reported at Chuka police station. The woman even visited her in-laws and informed them that she had burnt the house. What is shocking also is that the police are asking the US-based husband to produce proof of ownership of the property before the woman is arrested and charged. It is said the woman has been frequenting the police station, trying to thwart prosecution of the case.***********A city Jubilee MP who was trounced in the party nominations and declared support for his rival seems to have had a change of heart and is now using underhand tactics to undermine his youthful rival. It is said the MP has vowed to do whatever it takes, including splashing his vast resources, to teach the rival a lesson he will never forget. He is also contemplating backing a contestant in a NASA party to clinch the seat. The veteran politician is said to be unhappy with the JP candidate for 'inciting' the constituents throughout his term, until they rejected him in the April nominations. The lawmaker is whispering to his former key supporters to champion support for a youthful NASA candidate.
