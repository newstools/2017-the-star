The Mavoko law courts yesterday conducted open courts to educate residents on operations and procedures. Kassan said those charged with traffic offences took plea in public, so that residents could see what happens in courts. The initiative called “Mavoko Law Courts Fraternity Open Day” was held at the Mavoko Stadium, Athi River town. “The aim of this exercise is to create public awareness on the court procedures, operations and reforms we have been doing as the Judiciary,” said Court Users Committee chairman and principal magistrate Linus Kassan. “All members of the court users including professionals, magistrates, prosecutors, lawyers, police officers, provincial administrators and local investors are inattendance,” Kassan said. He said people believe courts are places meant to send people to jail.
