NASA yesterday dismissed the Jubilee manifesto, saying it is a list of promises JP has failed to deliver in the last four years.They described it as a hoax and said Kenyans will use Jubilee&rsquo;s scorecard to vote in the August polls.&ldquo;When there is an incumbent government, everyone knows that its reelection will be determined by its record,&rdquo; NASA said in a press statement signed by Kisumu Senator Anyang&rsquo; Nyong&rsquo;o.They said Jubilee has failed to explain in its manifesto how it will tackle corruption and the spiralling debt, which has denied Kenyans good services.&ldquo;All their promises in their new manifesto end up highlighting what they failed to deliver from their last one,&rdquo; the statement says.They said the polls have shown 70 per cent of Kenyans believe the country is headed in the wrong direction.&ldquo;It is a clear indication that many Jubilee supporters are also deeply aggrieved by the grotesque plunder of our resources,&rdquo; the statement adds. The worst of Jubilee&rsquo;s disastrous policies centres on exclusion, they said.&ldquo;What is astonishing is that Jubilee continued with the policy after the election, as if [President] Uhuru Kenyatta and [Deputy President] William Ruto were unaware that there would be an electoral reckoning five years later! That is why we have seen many leaders who deserted the opposition join the government,&rdquo; the leaders said.The leaders said Jubilee&rsquo;s leadership has been characterised by tribalism, theft, bad governance and disregard of the Constitution due to bad policies, which have caused death and impoverished Kenyans.&ldquo;Kenyans know that their major afflictions are not due to acts of nature,&rdquo; they said.The mismanagement of the economy has pushed up the costs of living and inflation, rendered youths jobless and many employees retrenched in all sectors of the economy, led to ethnic clashes, urban crime and land-grabbing.
