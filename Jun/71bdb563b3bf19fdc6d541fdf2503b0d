Telco giant Safaricom Tuesday opened its fourth regional headquarter in Kisumu as part of its regionalization strategy aimed at strengthening customer services across the country. The Kisumu regional office will serve ten counties in Western and Nyanza including Busia, Bungoma, Homabay, Kakamega, Kisii, Kisumu, Migori, Nyamira, Siaya, Vihiga and parts of Narok county. “This strategy has led to increased convenience for Safaricom customers, and enables us to have a closer understanding of their needs when designing our products and services,” Safaricom CEO Bob Collymore said. He said that over the last two years, the telco has increased its network coverage in the Western region by 71 per cent.
