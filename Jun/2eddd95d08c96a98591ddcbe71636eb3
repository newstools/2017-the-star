The government has explained that slow imports are the reason for the shortage of the Sh90 subsidised flour.But Agriculture CS Willy Bett said 42,000 tonnes of grain are being transported from the Port of Mombasa and that millers will get the supply as soon as possible.He spoke in Nairobi on Tuesday during the launch of the African Sustainable Livestock 2050 project by the Food and Agriculture organization and USAID. Bett added that large scale millers are overwhelmed as some players in the processing segment had not embraced the government&rsquo;s subsidy programme.&ldquo;Posho mills will start receiving white maize at the end of this week as part of steps to address the shortage of flour in far-off areas. This is a group that needs to be attended to as they serve consumers who do not use sifted flour,&rdquo; he said.The CS promised a solution as more vessels arrive with imports from Mexico and other countries. He said another 42,000 tonnes will arrive next week, followed by 33,000 tonnes and another 36,000 tonnes.In the month of June, Kenya will have received 114,000 metric tonnes. According to the sample matrix for monitoring maize shipment by the ministry for the month of May-September, 35,000, 38,000 and 40,000 more tonnes will arrive in July.Large scale millers in Kenya have a market share of 30-40 per cent while their small scale counterparts have the larger share of 60 per cent.The Sh6 billion subsidy programme launched early in May saw large-scale millers get the bigger share of the imports due to their advanced processing capacity.Small scale millers got 203,000 bags of imported maize.
