Deputy President William Ruto has announced subsidized fertiliser will be sold for Sh1,200 per bag from December.This will help farmers produce more food and avoid a food shortage, he said.The fertiliser has been selling for Sh1,800 per 50kg bag, but Ruto said with improved infrastructure, including transportation using thestandard gauge railway, the price will fall by Sh600 per bag.He said, &ldquo;When I was Agriculture minister, I found fertiliser was being sold at Sh6,000 per bag, but we reduced that to Sh2,500 and then Sh2,300 and now Sh1,800. But now as Jubilee, we have said that from December, the fertiliser will sell at Sh1,200 per bag.&rdquo;Ruto spoke yesterday at the New KCC factory in Eldoret, which was commissioned by President Uhuru Kenyatta after refurbishment at a cost of Sh400 million.&ldquo;The reduced fertiliser prices will enable our farmers to produce more so we avoid the problems we have now, like the shortage of maize flour,&rdquo; he said.Ruto said the Jubilee government has invested heavily in improving the agriculture sector. He said New KCC in 2013 paid farmers Sh2 billion, but now, payments have gone up to Sh5 billion annually.&ldquo;The returns to farmers in 2017 are two-and-a-half times more than what farmers used to get in 2013. Mr President, I am also a farmer, but not as good as you and I was one of those running a milk kiosk, which I closed because New KCC is paying better,&rdquo; Ruto said.He said New KCC pays farmers Sh43 per kilogramme of milk, not Sh30 as claimed by NASA.He said following completion of the factory in Eldoret, wastage of milk from farmers in the region will be reduced.Last week, Turkana residents expressed outrage that traders were selling the government&rsquo;s subsidised maize flour at Sh150 for a two-kg pack. They said the unga costs more than regular packets.David Barasa, a mason in Lodwar town, said residents were excited until they learned of the prices. They resorted to buying grains at Sh120 for two-kilogramme containers. &ldquo;Casual labourers take ugali every day. Life has been very difficult for us since the prices went up,&rdquo; he said.
