President Uhuru Kenyatta's visit to Ukambani is late and will not earn him votes, Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana has said. The governor said the Jubilee administration has failed to implement major projects in the region to warrant the people's support for Uhuru. "If Uhuru had listened to us from 2013 when we gave him the projects
we wanted done, his visit would have yielded votes." He spoke at Emali town, Kibwezi West, on Friday when he commissioned Emali modern bus station that was funded by the county. Kibwana said failure by Jubilee to build Thwake dam, Konza City and major roads under the national government will cost Uhuru the presidency. The county boss further claimed that having sensed defeat, Jubilee is using local administrators to rig the August 8 election. He claimed the ruling coalition is forcing chiefs and their assistants to help them rig the polls. But Mbooni MP Kisoi Munyao, who defected from Wiper to Jubilee, rubbished claims that Uhuru does not have support in the region. He said Mbooni will deliver the highest number of votes for the President and that NASA flag bearer Raila Odinga can’t beat the incumbent. Kibwana, who was accompanied by Deputy Governor Adeline Mwau and other county officials, urged the community to back the National Super Alliance. He exuded confidence that the Opposition will win the election. "Uhuru won last election by a small margin just because Raila and ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi were not together." "Now that they are in the same camp and have poached Bomet Governor Isac Rutto, Jubilee will lose terribly," he said. President Uhuru Kenyatta took his campaigns to Kitui on Friday and is expected to be in Makueni on Saturday. Read: Ukambani Jubilee team targets 350,000 votes
