Ismael Changawa recovered from a set down to sail through to the semi-finals after beating Rwandese Ernest Habiyambere 4-6, 6-3, 6-1 in the ongoing Britam Kenya Open tennis Championships at Nairobi Club. Having lost 6-4 to the Rwandese in the first set, the defending champion pulled a champion-esque display in the second set to floor the tiring Rwandese 6-3 in the second set to restore parity. A more impressive display in the determinant set saw the US-based player sail to the semis recording 6-1 win. Changawa will face another Kenyan Sheil Kotecha, who floored Albert Njogu in the semis. Changawa said: “I had to play like a champion to win today’s game. After falling behind in the opening set, I had to put more effort in the second and third. It wasn’t an easy win. The guy was sharp and with amazing skills.” After downing Njogu 6-1,6-4 in the quarter finals, Kotecha set a date with Changawa in what is deemed as the best clash in the championship. It will be the first career meeting between the duo with a lot at stake. Kotecha said: “It’s going to be a tough match and whoever will utilise his chances well will book a spot in the final. I have never played Changawa before but I have watched him play a number of matches. I hope for the best. He is a good guy with experience, strength and skills.” In other quarter-finals clashes, former champion Duncan Mugabe eased past Tanzanian Emmanuel Nicodemo in sets of 6-1,6-2 to book a spot in the semis. The Ugandan will play against home-boy Ibrahim Yego who punched Rwandese Olivier Havugima 6-1, 6-0. A win for Mugabe will enable him rub off last edition’s bad memories of disqualification on disciplinary grounds. Having beaten Yego twice before, the Ugandan will be seeking to carry this form into the encounter. He said: “When I compare the previous editions I have taken part with this one, I believe my preparations are better. The players have improved and I no longer find easy wins. I have played Yego twice, winning both encounters and I hope to replicate the same in the semis. I know the guy I am playing is different from the past encounters and so I am bracing up for a tough game.”
