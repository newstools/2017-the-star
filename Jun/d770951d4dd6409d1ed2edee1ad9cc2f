In March, 20 babies died within 14 days in Nakuru and Baringo counties. The cause of death was suspected to have been viral pneumonia &mdash;which is preventable. According to WHO, pneumonia accounts for 16 per cent of all deaths of children under five years. It killed 920,136 children worldwide in 2015. Pneumonia can be caused by viruses, bacteria, or fungi and can be prevented by immunisation, good nutrition, and by addressing environmental problems.In the final instalment of our three-part series on maternal health, we look at interventions devised to save the lives of mothers and their babies.10-in-one vaccine can save livesIn January 2011, following recommendations by WHO and with financial support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the Ministry of Health introduced the combination PCV-10 vaccine &ndash; targetting 10 bacteria that cause invasive pneumococcal disease. These infections are caused by streptococcus bacteria, which can case ailments ranging from ear and sinus infections, to pneumonia and other bloodstream infections.The disease is frequently fatal among children and infants. Kenya was among the first countries in Africa to introduce PCV, and the first low-income country to use the 10-valent vaccine. Today, infants receive the vaccine in three doses at six, 10 and 14 weeks. Poor attendanceHowever, attendance is poor when it comes to vaccines. The majority of mothers make on average one or two visits to the clinic after the birth of their baby and usually do not attend for booster doses of these vaccines.The push to immunise babies against pneumonia is one way the country is making advances on the 2025 targets of the Integrated Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Pneumonia and Diarrhoea released by WHO and Unicef in 2013.The plan recognises that preventing and controlling pneumonia and diarrhoea separately has not been an effective strategy and, hence, the introduction of the PCV10 in 102 countries in 2013.According to research by the Kenya Medical Research Institute, the introduction of PCV10 in Kenya resulted in an estimated 42.7 per cent reduction in incidents of pneumococcal disease and a 6.1 per cent reduction in childhood deaths.A jab can mean life, deathIn 2014, the government introduced yet another vaccine &mdash; against Rotavirus &mdash; to protect children against viral diarrhoea. It also augments health communication efforts to teach mothers about rehydrating their children orally with salt solutions should they have diarrhoea.A child is considered to be fully immunised if she or he has received a BCG vaccination against tuberculosis; three doses of DPT vaccine to prevent diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough), and tetanus (or three doses of pentavalent, which includes DPT and vaccinations against both hepatitis B and haemophilus influenza type B); at least three doses of polio vaccine; and one dose of measles vaccine. These vaccinations should be given during the first year of life.While polio may have been kicked out of most parts of the country, there are occasional instances reported, especially at the refugee camps in Northern Kenya. The incidents usually occur when violence flares up in South Sudan and or Somalia, which leads to an influx of refugees. This is what happened in 2013 when all the 14 cases of polio reported in Kenya occurred at the Dadaab camp.Regular vaccination Regular vaccination campaigns are conducted every year to immunise children against childhood diseases, including vaccinations Hepatitis B and haemophilus Influenzae type B. These diseases are among the highest causes of death and constant sickness among children below nine years of age. But despite these efforts, child morbidity is still high.A 2013 Unicef report on child mortality indicated a huge variance in the number of children immunised. Some of the administrative districts only reach 45 per cent of the children while others report nearly ( 95 per cent) immunisation cover.According to the Kenya Demographic and Health Survey, two out of three children are immunised nationally. Overall, 68 per cent of children age 12-23 months are fully vaccinated with BCG, measles, pentavalent, polio, and pneumococcal vaccines; 71 percent have received all basic vaccinations, and two per cent of children have not received any vaccines.However, there is a huge variance, with only 40 per cent of the children in counties such as Migori, Mandera getting full immunisation.How one county addresses the problem of child deathsThe Kenya Expanded Programme on Immunization was established in June 1980 by the Kenya government to oversee and monitor vaccinations to all children in Kenya.Kisumu lies at what would be considered the heart of the malaria zone. To reduce the number of babies dying from malaria, the county government set out to create a semi-autonomous clinic for children at the county&rsquo;s biggest health facility.Inside Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Training and Referral Hospital, or just Russia as it is known to locals, is the Obama Children&rsquo;s Ward.It is an 80-bed facility where mothers with sick children are not only unburdened of queuing, but offered &ldquo;self-contained&rdquo; services, Russia&rsquo;s Medical Superintendent Dr Juliana Otieno says. &ldquo;Apart from pints of blood that have to be sourced from the main hospital, Obama has it&rsquo;s own microbiology labs, pharmacy and staff and the beds have space where the mother also can sleep,&rdquo; she said.Nurse in-charge Jane Olum says Obama has 15 daily admissions.While the 13 nurses in the facility are not enough, they are able to manage paediatric emergencies such as convulsions and shocks.To conclude, it is a tragedy that more than 50 years after Independence, we still have mothers and children dying of conditions that are preventable.As the election draws closer and the government takes stock of the gains in the health sector, it is important to have serious discussions on public health policy and &mdash; more specifically maternal and child health
