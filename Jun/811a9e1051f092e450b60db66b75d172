In its current issue, Africa Confidential, the fortnightly UK-based newsletter that has focussed on analysing politics and economics in Africa since 1960, has the following sub-heading on its story about the presidential campaign in Kenya, “Opposition and government are outbidding each other with their spending promises amid signs of electoral disillusionment”. Both President Uhuru Kenyatta of the ruling Jubilee Party and the opposition NASA’s candidate Raila Odinga now promise the same thing if either wins: Free secondary school education. This is an idea that has enormous feel-good factors, but is it really practicable? Neither candidate has told Kenyans how this fine-sounding pledge will be rolled out, where the money will come from and how it might affect other education funding. The Free Primary Education programme has been marred by a lot of challenges over the years, especially in the all-important release of funds. The purchasing and maintenance of textbooks has also been a headache. Could both main contenders tell the electorate how they intend to ensure that the money for free secondary education serves the intended purpose?
