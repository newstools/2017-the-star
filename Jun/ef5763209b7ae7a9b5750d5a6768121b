Barely two months to the General Election, two front runners for Thika Town MP are embroiled in a fight over who should be given credit for development projects initiated in the constituency. Eng Patrick Wainaina, alias Wajungle, and incumbent Alice Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a have already lodged formal complaints with Thika acting police boss Bernard Ayoo over their conflict.The two were cleared by the IEBC to contest for the seat a week ago.Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a, on Friday, after filing her report, accused Wainaina of initiating projects in the constituency without following laid-down procedures.She said her rivals are connecting residents to electricity in remote areas of Komo, Githima and Munyu, and putting up street lights. Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a, running on Jubilee, said what they are doing is illegal and they should stop. The MP accused Wainaina of claiming some of the national government&rsquo;s projects in Makongeni estate are his. She said the candidate is &ldquo;seeking cheap publicity&rdquo;.&ldquo;During a visit to Makongeni, the President promised electricity would be installed in all the estates within the area, and the work has already been done. But we were shocked to learn a candidate vying as an independent has branded the project as his,&rdquo; Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a said.&ldquo;I will also take this matter to the IEBC because we signed a code of conduct, which we all understand what it stipulates. I am the only one assigned to oversee government projects in my constituency.&rdquo;However, Wainaina said his projects were carried out under his Jungle Nut Foundation. He said the law, under the Public-Private Partnerships Act, allows him to initiate the projects. Speaking on Tuesday in Thika town, Wainaina said his rival is afraid he is becoming popular. &ldquo;Why fight a project that is helping residents?&rdquo;
