Kisauni MP Rashid Bedzimba&rsquo;s campaign team has bem bolstered after one of his main rival&rsquo;s point men defected and joined them.The team is said to be keen to poach Ali Mbogo&rsquo;s campaigners to weaken him and tilt the scales of the August 8 election. On Tuesday, Bedzimba (pictured) launched his campaign at Bilima grounds in Mwandoni. Kenga Yaa, who was Mbogo&rsquo;s campaigner, has jumped ship and is now on Bedzimba&rsquo;s side. He was presented to supporters during the campaign launch. Bedzimba&rsquo;s campaign secretariat strategist Allan Owano denied they poached Yaa. He said Yaa was impressed by Bedzimba&rsquo;s development record and manifesto and decided to join the team.&ldquo;We really don&rsquo;t want to poach anybody. Our team is already full and well prepared. We have no reason to poach. But our doors are open for anybody who wants to come and join,&rdquo; he said on Wednesday. &ldquo;We welcome all Kisauni residents to partner with us to victory. We are not in the business of poaching.&rdquo;Yaa told the Star he has rejoined Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho&rsquo;s side, adding t he was frustrated and ignored by Mbogo&rsquo;s team. Mbogo said Yaa exercised his democratic right and urged his supporters not worry about his departure.
