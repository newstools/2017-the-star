British Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said it was time for Prime Minister Theresa May to stand down after election results indicated she had lost votes, support and the confidence of voters."This election was called in order for the prime minister to gain a large majority in order for her to assert her authority," he said in London."If there is a message from tonight's results, it's this: the Prime Minister called this election because she wanted a mandate," Corbyn said. "Well the mandate she's got is lost Conservative seats, lost votes, lost support and lost confidence.""I would have thought that's enough to go, and make way for a government that will be truly representative of all of the people of this country."British Prime Minister Theresa May looks set to lose her parliamentary majority on Friday after a surprisingly poor election performance, throwing her own future into doubt. Jacob Rees-Mogg, Eurosceptic lawmaker"I think Mrs May will have a good deal of support. She's only been the leader for under a year, she got it without any opposition, an uncontested election with support up and down the country. I don't think the Conservative Party is so fickle, or such a fair-weather friend as it would not continue to back the Prime Minister."Anna Soubry, Pro-European Lawmaker"She's in a very difficult place, she's a remarkable and a very talented woman and she doesn't shy from difficult decisions, but she now has to obviously consider her position.""Theresa did put her mark on this campaign, she takes responsibility as she always does, and I know she will, for the running of the campaign. It was tightly knit group, and it was her group that ran this campaign.""I'm afraid we ran a pretty dreadful campaign, that's probably me being generous.""The change of heart on social care, I'm afraid, deeply flawed Theresa May, it did not make her look the strong and stable prime minister and leader that she had said that she was. That was a very difficult and very serious blow in terms of her own credibility."Iain Duncan Smith, former Conservative party leader"I just want some stability. She is prime minister, she remains prime minister and the country has to come first."
