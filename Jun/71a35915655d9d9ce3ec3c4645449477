Kipsigis Council of Elders Bureti chapter chairman Isaiah Cheluget, 86, died on Monday – shortly after he was given a clean bill of health. He died at the Aga Khan Hospital, after he developed complications at his Bureti home. He will be buried on Wednesday. The multibillionaire served as Nyanza Provincial Commissioner between 1969 and 1989. Upon retiring from the civil service, he was appointed Nyayo Tea Zone chairman. Until his death, Cheluget (pictured) was instrumental in championing the preservation of the Mau Forest and, opposing construction of the Sh38 billion Itare Dam in Kuresoi South, Nakuru county. With the help of Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka, Cheluget hired a law firm to stop the diversion of water from Ndoinet Forest to feed the dam. He argued that this will hurt the Kipsigis community in Kericho and Bomet counties. Kipsigis leaders yesterday sent condolences to Cheluget’s family. Kanu’s Kericho governor candidate Jonal Keter said it will take ages before the Kipsigis get another a leader of Cheluget’s calibre.
