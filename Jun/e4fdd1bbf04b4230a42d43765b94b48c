Private universities are facing tough times for lack of students, after almost all students who qualified in last year&rsquo;s KCSE were absorbed by public institutions.One of those hard hit is the University of Eastern Africa, Baraton, which has closed four of its campuses over low student enrolment.Some 1,000 staff have been sent home in a major cost cutting measure by the Seventh-day Adventist-run institution.Those affected include lecturers and support staff.Campuses affected include Kisii, Nairobi, Eldoret and Kisumu.Vice chancellor Phillip Maiyo said the decision to close the four campuses was as result of decreasing student enrolment.&ldquo;The university council, in its meeting of June 18, decided to close the four campuses located in Eldoret, Nairobi, Kisumu and Kisii with immediate effect,&rdquo; reads Maiyo&rsquo;s letter.Education reformsThe university senate has instructed all students based in the affected campuses to report to the main campus in Eldoret.They will then be advised on the university&rsquo;s integration plan to enable them complete their studies.Private universities are feeling the heat of radical changes aimed at improving the quality of education. Following the tough measures initiated by Education CS Fred Matiang&rsquo;i in the administration of national exams, only 88,929 candidates scored above C+ plus in KCSE &ndash; the minimum university entry qualification. The candidates were placed in public universities leaving the private institutions with no students to admit. The government enrolled 12,000 students in private universities such as Daystar, Mount Kenya, USIU and Strathmore. They are funded at a cost of Sh700,000.
