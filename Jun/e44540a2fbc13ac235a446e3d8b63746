The European Union has deployed 30 election observers to assess the entire electoral process in 13 locations as the August 8 election nears.The team, which was invited by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission, will follow campaign trails, meet election officials and stakeholders, and send their findings to a team of 10 experts based in Nairobi.Speaking while flagging off the convoy in Nairobi yesterday, EU election observation mission to Kenya deputy chief observer Hannah Roberts said the team will oversee the process before, during and after the polls.She said they will assess the legal framework, election administration, respect for fundamental freedoms and voting, counting and transmission of election results.&ldquo;We always dispatch them in two pairs so we can get more reliable information and balanced opinions. They will be going out to see the ground reality of what is happening with this electoral process in Kenya,&rdquo; Roberts said.She said that closer to Election Day, the long-term observation team will be reinforced by 32 short-term observers.The delegation will be backed by seven Members of the European Parliament and representatives of some European embassies in Kenya.&ldquo;We will be here throughout the process and for the weeks afterwards to follow the completion and announcement of the results, together with the complaints and petitions processes,&rdquo; Roberts added.Two days after the polls, the team will release a preliminary statement based on the information collected, checked and analysed by the mission.A final report with recommendations for future election reforms in Kenya will be released two months later.Mission chief observer Marietje Schaake is scheduled to hold a series of meetings with IEBC officials, candidates and other key players tomorrow.The team said they will ensure fairness in its assessment, saying they &ldquo;are bound by a strict code of conduct that requires us to be neutral and impartial and, thus, cannot interfere with the electoral process, including offering assistance or advice&rdquo;.Their aim is to help Kenya improve on its future elections, support the democratic process and strengthen respect for human rights and the rule of law. The EU deployed election observers in Kenya in 2002, 2007 and 2013.It has deployed more than 100 election observation missions to over 50 countries since 2000.
