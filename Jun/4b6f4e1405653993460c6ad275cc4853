Financial services provider Alexander Forbes yesterday challenged the government to introduce policy reforms that will enhance savings for life after retirement through increased contributions.Speaking to reporters during the launch of the firm&rsquo;s mobile application and online portal in Nairobi, chief executive Sundeep Raichura said that incremental changes on penalties are not likely to improve the level of contributions.Treasury CS Henry Rotich in the Finance Bill 2017 has slapped a penalty of Sh100,000 for late submission of statutory returns and an addition of Sh1,000 for each day the offence persists. Before the new penalties, service providers were fined Sh500,000 on conviction for late submissions. &ldquo;What we are seeing every year is incremental changes, but what we need is more deeper policy reforms to improve coverage and the adequacy of the benefits,&rdquo; Raichura said. &ldquo; What we are seeing based on the studies we carry out is that the average replacement rate is translating to 20-25 per cent of one&rsquo;s salary before retirement, while the target should be about 70-75 per cent.&rdquo; Raichura added: &ldquo;We therefore feel there is need for policy measures to increase the level of contributions so that when Kenyans retire they can sustain themselves.&rdquo;
