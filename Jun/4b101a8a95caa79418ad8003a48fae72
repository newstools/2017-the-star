Top lawyers will on Friday battle it out in court over the urgent suit filed by the opposition, which seeks to have the Sh2.5 billion ballot papers printing tender cancelled.Documents filed in court shows Al Ghurair, the Dubai-based firm contracted by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to print ballot papers, has already printed 80 per cent of the ballot papers for the governor race, and is waiting to hand them over to the IEBC in Nairobi.The company has also printed 25 per cent of the ballot materials for woman representative posts.A three-judge bench comprising Justice Joel Ngugi, John Mativo and George Odunga yesterday directed parties to argue the high-profile case on June 30.Jubilee Party has hired senior lawyers who include Fred Ngatia, Ahmednasir Abdullahi and Tom Macharia to defend the contract. NASA is being represented by lawyers James Orengo, Paul Mwangi and Prof Ben Sihanya.Other lawyers are Harrison Kinyanjui, for interested parties, while Peter Emale represents Third way Alliance.The IEBC, which has only 40 days to conduct the General Election on August 8, has put up a spirited fight to have the suit dismissed.Through its lawyers led by Kamau Karoli and Milly Odari, the commission says cancelling the contract will have serious consequences.NASA is opposed to the tender awarded to Al Ghurair Printing and Publishing, while Jubilee Party supports the tender. JP has accused the opposition of trying to disrupt the election. NASA&rsquo;s contention is that election players were not consulted prior to the awarding of the controversial contract.
