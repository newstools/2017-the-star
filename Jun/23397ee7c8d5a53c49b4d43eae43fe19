The government has dismissed claims that the Muslim community is being profiled in the war on crime and terror.Sports and Culture CS Hassan Wario said the state is keen on safeguarding the interests of Muslims, according to the law, adding they are not discriminated against.He spoke in Nairobi on Friday during the Ramadan Iftar (breaking of fast) dinner. &ldquo;Our Constitution is clear that there is no state religion. It is therefore counter to logic to imagine that the government, which impartially serves all, should harangue an individual because of religion,&rdquo; Wario said. &ldquo;I wish to assure you that the voice of Muslims is strongly represented in the government.&rdquo;Wario cited flexible laws that allow the Muslim community to invest in Kenya, giving an example of growing Islamic banking.The dinner was hosted by Islamic Relief Kenya. Foreign Affairs CS Amina Mohammed, presidential candidate Abduba Dida, and the executive director of the NGO Coordination Board, Fazul Mahamed, among others, attended the event.Wario urged religious leaders to pray for a peaceful August 8 General Election, and cautioned them against being used to cause discord among their flock.Mahamed announced the government will grant IRK semi-diplomatic status to boost the NGO&rsquo;s operations in the country.Such status will accord IRK limited diplomatic privileges, such as unlimited access to its areas of operation. It will also allow the organisation to import items for charity work duty-free. IRK started operations in Kenya in 1993, and opened a fully fledged office in 2006. It has helped 624,000 people in need of proper health, emergency, nutrition, water, and education, among others.
