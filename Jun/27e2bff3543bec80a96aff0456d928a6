Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero yesterday asked the Senate to compel the national government to settle the Sh72 billion debt it owes the county.He petitioned the Finance and Budget Committee to help the county recover the money.Kidero said the state is frustrating him because he is an ODM governor. &ldquo;This is a clear sabotage and frustration by the national government. If I was a Jubilee governor, they would have settled this debt long time ago,&rdquo; he told journalists.Kidero said his administration has been unable to meet most of its obligations because of cash flow problems, a matter he said, has been compounded by the debt.&ldquo;Nairobi county is unable to meet its financial obligations, which include payment of salaries, statutory deductions and service delivery to the residents,&rdquo; Kidero said.He said the county spends more than 70 per cent of its revenue on salaries. &ldquo;In general, our collections are lower than our expenses,&rdquo; Kidero said.He told the Billow Kerrow-led committee the government has refused to pay Sh63 billion for 2,000 acres it acquired from the county for the military base in Embakasi, despite appeals to the Treasury and Cabinet.About Sh9 billion, which has accrued from rates and parking for government vehicles, have also not been paid.The committee, sitting in County Hall, demanded to know whether the county had exhausted all the mechanisms before seeking the Senate&rsquo;s intervention.&ldquo;What I want to know is whether it is not due to laxity on your side that the debt has not been recovered, because you have many avenues. You can auction the property or seek a court order for enforcement,&rdquo; Kerrow said.Kidero said, &ldquo;We know the rating act allows us to auction property belonging to defaulters, but it is practically impossible to auction Parliament for example. That is why we have resorted to other mechanisms, which include petitioning the Senate.&rdquo;Migori Senator Wilfred Machage argued said the law that provides for action on defaulters&rsquo; property does not discriminate against private or public property.According to the governor&rsquo;s submissions, KBC owes City Hall Sh2.6 billion, the National Assembly owes Sh48.6 billion and Kenya Power is yet to settle Sh605.3 million for way leaves.The committee heard the county government owes other agencies, including national government institutions, Sh48 billion. They include statutory deductions owed to the KRA, NSSF, and Laptrust and Lapfund.&ldquo;The two governments should undertake a debt swap and settlement of the balance either by cash guarantee financial instruments,&rdquo; Kidero told the committee. He said he will not hesitate to move to court to enforce payment if the Senate fails to intervene.
