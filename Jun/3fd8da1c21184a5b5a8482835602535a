Baringo Senator aspirant Simon Chelugui is worried that he will be defeated if residents worship the wealth of former president Daniel Moi's family.Moi is the father of Senator Gideon Moi, who is Kanu chairman.Chelugui, a Jubilee aspirant, termed himself a "poor lad from a humble background" whose only ambition is to bring change."For sure I don't have enough money to dish out during campaigns. Therefore, if people choose to elect money heavyweights I am bound to lose the August 8 election," he said.The former Betting Control and Licensing Board director, who is said to enjoy DP William Ruto's support, spoke to The Star by phone on Tuesday.Kanu and several other parties endorsed President Uhuru Kenyatta's re-election bid on May 6.Gideon said the party decided to support Uhuru so he can continue implementing policies that will improve lives.More on this: [VIDEO] Major boost for Uhuru as Kanu, Chap Chap, Narc-K and EFP endorse re-election bidOn Sunday, Chelugui's meeting with 300 supporters at a Koriema hotel was disrupted when a group of 1,000 Kanu supporters stormed in.He was booed and insulted for inviting only a few people instead of holding a big rally to address all the people of Baringo South.But the politician said he budgeted for a small meeting with supporters from Mukutani, Mochongoi, Marigat and Ilchamus wards."I was surprised to hear voices in the crowd saying: "Senator Moi dishes out Sh4,000 for each of us and we don't even have to follow up. What kind of man is Chelugui if he locks people out, without even a glass of water?"Chelugui compared himself to Gideon saying: "He has over Sh1,000 to offer each individual in one function yet my personal budget is only Sh50 or Sh100."The incumbent stole the show during his clearance by the IEBC after turning up with a fleet of vehicles.His supporters cheered when he was handed the nominations certificate and carried on with the celebrations through Kabarnet town.More on this: [PHOTOS] Gideon Moi steals show with fleet of cars as IEBC clears him for pollChelugui said he does not have the "rich financial muscle" but urged his opponents to stop directing his supporters to disrupt his meetings."I am just but a simple citizen aspiring to secure power to serve my people. I am like any other average son of the soil who is not as royal as he is, so let him spare me the rod," he said of Gideon.The aspirant accused some journalists of playing into the Senator's "petty politics" by publishing malicious and unconfirmed reports through their media houses and social media.
