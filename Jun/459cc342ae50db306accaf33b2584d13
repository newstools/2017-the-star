We will deal with the issue firmly before the August 8 general election."The Senator warned IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati that they risk being sent packing like the defunct ECK "which perpetuated electoral malpractices.""We will fight these acts of connivance until everything is done according to the law as defined by the Constitution," Orengo said.He made the comments on Saturday in Ulumba village, Ugunja constituency during the burial of his paternal uncle Charles Orengo.Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi echoed the sentiments calling for the intervention of the international community to solve the bond of contention on the ballot papers tender.The MP said that the move by IEBC to refuse to terminate the tender is a clear indication that Jubilee government has started to pre-rig the forthcoming elections.
