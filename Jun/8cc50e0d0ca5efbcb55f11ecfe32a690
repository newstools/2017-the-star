An SGR passenger train on Saturday knocked down a cow killing it instantly.The cow is believed to have strayed into the line after elephants reportedly destroyed the fence bordering the line.The train was headed to Mariakani at the time of the accident."After knocking the cow, the train slowed down but continued with its journey to the station," officials who sought anonymity said.The official said many pastoralists graze their animals in that section since the fences have not been mended."Herders graze their animals in the area because the grass is greener on the other side of the line," the SGR official said.
