Two Lamu youths were shot on Friday after police used live bullets to disperse protesters demanding the release of a convicted drug trafficker. Two officers were injured during the skirmishes. The youths were trying to block police from transferring the convict to prison. "Trouble started after the youths turned chaotic and begun pelting stones at us, they threatened to attack the magistrate and even burn the courts if their colleagues would not set free," one of the officers said. The two, Mohammed Yusuf,40, and Abdulatif Abdalla,16, are recuperating at the King Fahad Lamu County hospital. Witnesses said the youths were dissatisfied with the judgment and felt it was unfair. Lamu county commissioner Joseph Kanyiri said the incident was a total breach of the law as the locals attempted to take the law in their hands. As per the law, those convicted had a right to appeal their case within 14 days. Lamu Governor Issa Timammy is among the first leaders who visited the victims on Friday night to console them.
