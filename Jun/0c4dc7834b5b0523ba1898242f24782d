Kiambu dairy farmers want the 30 cents per litre of milk levied by the county government reduced.They said on Tuesday this is partly to blame for their low returns, especially for small-scale farmers.They met leaders under the United for Kiambu initiative, including Senator Kimani Wamatangi, Kabete MP Ferdinand Waititu, who is the JP governor candidate, and Waititu&rsquo;s running mate James Nyoro. Cooperative leaders Acquiline Njoki and John Mugwe said that despite having to pay the cess, the county does not serve them as it should.&ldquo;We have complained about the high taxation. This has fallen on deaf ears. Farmers have been complaining that their returns are low due to high costs of animal feeds, pesticides and medicines,&rdquo; Charles Githunguri, chairman of the cooperative that makes Fresha milk, said.The leaders promised to fix farmers&rsquo; problems through proper legislation and allocation of credit funds for better yield.
