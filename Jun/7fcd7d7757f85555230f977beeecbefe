A wanted notorious criminal gang leader was on Sunday killed by a mob in Old Town, Mombasa county. Mohammed Bobocha was killed after he allegedly attacked a resident in Madobini. He was among key leaders of the 'Old Town Youth Gang' and has been on police radar for several crimes. Area OCPD Lucas Ogara said the suspect was with two other accomplices when they attacked the resident. "He was confronted by locals and killed by an irate mob after he attacked a resident." In May, police released 24 names and photographs of the knife-wielding juvenile criminal gang members. The lot was blamed for increasing cases of crime in Mombasa's Old Town. Their identities were released after they were profiled. The group targets women, children as well as security agencies and kills at the slightest provocation. "Five more youths were arrested and crude weapons seized," Ogara said. Members of the gang are believed to have started off as football players. Most of them are hooked on drugs and steal anything valuable so as to sustain their lavish lifestyles. Read: Police reveal faces of Old Town Youth Gang members
