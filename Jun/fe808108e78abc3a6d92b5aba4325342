Five students from Kisumu Girls&rsquo; High School will represent their institution in the upcoming Global Technovation, which will take place on August 7 in San Francisco. Global Technovation is a programme that equips girls with programming and coding skills. Purity Achieng and Synthia Otieno in form four, with colleagues Macrine Atieno, Ivy Akinyi, and Stacy Owino developed a mobile app aimed at reaching girls who have undergone female genital mutilation and those at risk. The students stand a chance to walk away with Sh1.5 million if they beat other contestants. &ldquo;Female genital mutilation is a national outcry, has been talked about, yet most people still ignore its effects, especially on the girl-child,&rdquo; Achieng said. The app has features that allow individuals to connect with FGM victims for moral support. Victims and those at risk can also contact a health centre for help. The app has an M-Pesa paybill number for well-wishers to send money to help victims.
