IT should come out clearly that Jubilee Party is not asking the independent candidates to step down or drop their bid for various elective positions: The individuals who have been nominated by Jubilee are the ones who are asking the independent candidates to step aside. It has nothing to do with Jubilee Party.I think Kenya is a democratic state and these independent candidates should also be given fair chance to fight for the electorate. Let the electorate decide.I don&rsquo;t think anybody has the moral authority to ask anyone to step down in a democratic process such as contesting for a political seat in this country.I don&rsquo;t want to talk about individuals but what I can say is that Jubilee Party and the principles on which it was formed should allow every candidate, whether party or independent, fairly in a free and transparent exercise and let the best win.You do realize there is nowhere where our party leader, President Uhuru Kenyatta, or Deputy President William Ruto, who is also our deputy party leader, has been heard talking about the independents or telling them not to compete, which means let the candidates compete and the voters vote. It is an election exercise and not a selection.You know what I believe in, after the election, whatever happens thereafter will be open negotiations and agreements on how to work with the independent candidates, there will be talks on where support will be needed and that will be an individual decision.I am saying let all candidates be given a chance to compete, whether independent or party candidate.In this 11th Parliament, which is winding up, we had a number of interdependent candidates who naturally opted to work with the Jubilee coalition. To be an independent candidate has both advantages and disadvantages &ndash; no pressure from a political party sponsoring you, while, on the other hand, it might be a challenge to push your legislative agenda both in and out of Parliament.Therefore the independent candidates have their constitutional rights to contest in the election and those who will be elected at the August General Election can opt to work with the government of the day, or stick with the opposition party. I am vying against an independent candidate in Kisumu East.Independent candidates should also not demand that party leaders campaign for or support them.
