Catholic bishops have asked IEBC to cancel the ballot papers tender awarded to the Dubai-based firm if the August poll players fail to agree.They said it will be better for the electoral agency to immediately source a firm other than Al Ghurair if dialogue over the issue fails.Bishop Cornelius Korir of Eldoret Catholic Diocese said IEBC must not compromise their mandate of delivering a credible poll."IEBC should uphold integrity. Let all political players come together and dialogue so as to save this country from any form of violence," Korir said.The clergymen addressed a press conference in Nairobi on Tuesday.The ballot papers printing tender has been contested by NASA leaders on claims that Jubilee leaders are working with the firm.Flag bearer Raila Odinga raised claims of a plot to rig the poll through ballot stuffing and asked that the tender be awarded to another firm.

A register that is not updated and verified still remains a loophole for violence."They said the electoral agency must strive to disassociate itself from any improper influence, manipulation and favouritism from any political party. "We must resist and reject any form of incitement, foster a unified nation, and desist from inflammatory utterances towards specific candidates," he said."Election-related violence among leaders and reject agendas that are not life and family friendly."He said every candidate must be assessed in regards to honesty, truthfulness, and integrity.The bishops dismissed claims of favouring a specific candidate in the scheduled election and urged Kenyans to choose leaders wisely."Vote for leaders who uphold values that promote Godly virtues. Let all political players avoid over bribery.""Let your voices be known and heard. Come out and vote if you have registered as a voter," the clergyman added.The bishops further expressed their disappointment with how candidates implicated in graft were cleared to contest the poll. "Corruption is a virus that has shamelessly and fearlessly risen in our country," Korir said. "Though the government has promised to be doing something, we have all seen less than we expected."They argued that it was ironic that some people who are regarded as untouchables were cleared while others still hold office.The clergymen said these half-hearted moves will bear no fruits in the fight against corruption."As a result, we have experienced a lack of basic commodities, insecurity, instability in the health sector and massive layoffs," Korir said.He added that lack of seriousness in the prosecution of the untouchables has proved weaknesses of the institutions put in place to fight the vice.
