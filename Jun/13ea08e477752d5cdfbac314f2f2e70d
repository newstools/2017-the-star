The Embu PNU governor candidate has received a big boost after independent candidates pledged to support and campaign for him. Hopeful Kithinji Kiragu got support from independent candidates Monica Syombua (woman representative), Alexander Mundigi (senator) and several other MCA aspirants. The candidates, who lost in the Jubilee Party primaries, promised to rally their supporters to vote for Kiragu. The aspirants spoke in Kairuri Playground, Embu North subcounty, when Kiragu launched his campaigns. This comes after Runyenjes MP Cecily Mbarire&rsquo;s close allies and campaigners promised to support Kiragu. Mbarire lost in the JP primaries to Governor Martin Wambora. Kiragu said his decision to run was driven by the need to fight alleged widespread corruption and underdevelopment in the county. He claimed Governor Wambora&rsquo;s administration carried out substandard and price-inflated development projects. Kiragu cited the tarmacking of the 28km Kibugu Road, which he said had been earmarked for construction as part of a 100km ring road traversing the county. He said the county government lied to residents that it was tarmacking the road with Probase technology, but that it has cost more money than if it had been constructed using the conventional methods.Kiragu said roads are necessary for enhancing development, but they should only be done alongside efforts to eradicate poverty.He said he will also ensure that the semiarid Mbeere North and South regions get irrigation water to turn them into food belts.Kiragu said he will also ensure the youth get self-employment through enhanced training and funding.He said if he is elected, he will come up with programmes to empower all residents.
