Police in Mombasa have denied targeting Muslim youths in their swoops.Mombasa county police commander Patterson Maelo says the swoops are standard operations conducted in crime hotspots to arrest criminals.Mvita MP Abdulswamad Nassir and lobby group Haki Africa on Tuesday accused police of harassing Muslim youths coming from prayers at night.&ldquo;It is a trend that subsides when we raise our voice and goes up when we stay quiet,&rdquo; Nassir said at the Mvita CDF office on Tuesday evening.He said police in the swoops do not identify themselves in the operations and are usually heavily armed "as if they are fighting armed people".Haki Africa executive director Hussein Khalid said cases have been reported in Bondeni, Old Town, Majengo, Floringi, Kisauni and Kongowea.These are crime hotspots.&ldquo;Haki Africa saying we are targeting Muslims is farfetched,&rdquo; Maelo said in his office on Tuesday evening.&ldquo;Police are carrying out general swoops and targeted hotspots only, not the mosques as alleged,&rdquo; he said.This comes barely four days after Jubilee Party's Mombasa governor hopeful Suleiman Shahbal warned against mixing religion and politics.He accused NASA of trying to raise emotions that threaten to divide the nation along religious lines.On Tuesday, Maelo said police misconduct can only be investigated if there are reports made at the police station, not at media houses.
