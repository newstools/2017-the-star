Nyeri Senate Jubilee candidate Ephraim Maina has urged Kenyans not to elect selfish people.He said most politicians are running for election to enrich themselves and their families, instead of helping wananchi.&ldquo;Out of 10 seeking your votes, maybe it&rsquo;s only one who is interested in helping the electorate. Others are there to enrich themselves,&rdquo; Maina said.&ldquo;I however wish to urge you to turn up in large numbers and reelect the UhuRuto government.&rdquo;He was speaking during the burial of Watson Komu, 39, at Chaka, Kieni East, Nyeri county, on Tuesday.Komu, a prominent Nyeri businessman, died last week in a road accident near his home on the Chaka-Narumoru road.Former President Mwai Kibaki, a close relative of the family, was at the burial, but he did not address the mourners.He was with his children Judy and David. Others present were Nyeri Governor Samuel Wamathai, Senate candidate Dan Wamahiu, MPs Priscilla Nyokabi, Peter Weru and Kanini Kega, among others. Wamahiu and Wamathai said Komu was always jovial.
