A funeral service for the three children of Eldoret MCA candidate James Ratemo was held yesterday. Clifford (seven), Glen (three) and Taya (five) were violently murdered three weeks ago and their bodies found dumped in the River Nzoia.Uasin Gishu Deputy Governor Daniel Chemno led mourners in calling for thorough investigations into the killings, to ensure those involved are prosecuted.Pupils from Highlands Academy, where two of the slain children were schooling wept as the bodies of their three schoolmates were being taken to the Eldoville SDA church, Kapsoya. Clifford, Glen and Taya were on their way to church before they went missing. Chemno described the incident as &ldquo;heinous&rdquo;. &ldquo;We never expected such bad news from this region. It&rsquo;s evil, and those who did it must be punished. The [parents] are mourning in so much pain. We need answers,&rdquo; Chemno said.He said the government has the machinery and the capacity to investigate the killings and bring to book those involved. Chemno said God forgives those who seek forgiveness. But he added: &ldquo;Before we go that route, we want the humans that did this to be dealt with.&rdquo; The pupils sang dirges and recited a poem in tribute to the departed angels.Pastor Jackson Bett, who led the service, said the family is in pain and wants answers, but appealed to them to rely on God to give them strength to bear the loss.Ratemo and his wife Ebby did not speak, but relatives said the deaths are devastating. Ebby&rsquo;s family said it is sad the incident took place about 8 kilometres from their home in Mois Bridge. &ldquo;If we knew, we would have done everything possible to dash there and save the children of our daughter Ebby. It&rsquo;s heart breaking,&rdquo; a relative said. The three will be buried in Kisii today.
