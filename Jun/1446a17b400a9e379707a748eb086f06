Cereal millers on Tuesday warned that the price of maize flour cannot be sustained at the Sh90 proposed price if the government does not ensure a steady supply of maize imports.Cereal Millers&rsquo; Association chairman Nick Hutchinson told a parliamentary committee that millers have no stocks and are heavily relying on the imported maize. run out of maize&ldquo;All millers have run out of maize. We are all waiting for the next vessel to arrive. The end of May is tight and we also suspect June is going to be tight,&rdquo; Hutchinson told the National Assembly&rsquo;s Agriculture Committee chaired by Mandera North MP Adan Nooru.Millers told MPs they had a combined maize stock of 110,000 bags when they sounded a warning in April. Hutchinson said although the second cereals vessel docked yesterday, maize was yet to be offloaded and that the congestion at the Port of Mombasa and transportation for milling poses a serious challenge for Kenyans to access subsidised maize flour. He raised concern that there is a huge jam at the port and some vessels will have to wait up to 20 days to offload maize.&ldquo;One vessel has docked and the next is expected at the port mid-June. The lack of a steady supply could see the prices of unga rise to where they were &ndash; Sh135 per 2kg packet of maize,&rdquo; he said.huge backlogRajim Shah, a Thika-based miller, warned that there is a huge backlog of offloading and millers could pass demurrage charges back to consumers.&ldquo;We hope the supply chain of maize continues but when it is disrupted we will see a shortage of flour and rise in prices,&rdquo; Shah said.Mombasa maize millers&rsquo; chairman Mohammed Islam said challenges facing the quick uptake of cereals from the port are attributed to the monopoly of grain handling services.
