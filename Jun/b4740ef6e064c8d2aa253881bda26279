ODM officials in Siaya county have condemned the Monday incident in Rarieda where youths interrupted Raila Odinga's rally.The youths, suspected to be allied to area MP Nicholas Gumbo, clashed with ODM supporters before police dispersed them.Gumbo, who is vying as an independent Siaya governor candidate, on Tuesday denied links to the chaos.Alego Usonga ODM chairman Oruenjo Umidha demanded a public apology from the legislator.He said the act associated with the MP's supporters amounted to disrespect for their party leader.Oruenjo said ODM is against violence during campaigns and misuse of youths during ahead of the August 8 general election."Our youths are supposed to be empowered, not to be taken for granted to cause violence during campaigns."Sam Hawala, ODM candidate for Siaya Township ward, also advocated for peaceful campaigns from any political divide.Hawala asked those who are still nursing wounds from ODM primaries not to vent their anger on Raila."Our party leader was neither a returning officer nor a clerk during the nominations," Hawala said on Thursday."Let those who lost in the party primaries sell their policies rather than investing in violence."He appealed to IEBC to investigate and take stern action against those behind the Rarieda chaos.Raila, who is Nasa presidential flag bearer, was forced to cut short his activities in the constituency following the incident.But some officials earlier said Gumbo was not to blame and that "overzealous goons" hired by ODM aspirants are the ones who caused the chaos.The officials and members of the business community further accused police or arresting innocent youths and allowing criminals who also injured people to escape.Read: Raila cuts short Rarieda trip after Gumbo, ODM backers clashAlso read: ODM officials absolve Gumbo of chaos that disrupted Raila trip
