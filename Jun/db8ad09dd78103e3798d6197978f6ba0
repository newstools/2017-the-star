Centum Investments Group has recorded a 16.48 per cent drop in net profit to Sh8.31 billion for the 12 months ended March from from Sh9.95 billion a year earlier.The listed investment company said profit before tax also dropped by 18 per cent from Sh10.87 billion in 2016 to Sh8.94 billion. The drop in net earnings, the company said yesterday, was attributable to a 67 per cent drop in earnings from its financial services subsidiary. This was largely impacted by the performance of Sidian Bank, where Centum is majority shareholder.Sidian Bank&rsquo;s 2016 full-year financial statement statement for the period ended December 2016 shows that the lender recorded a 92.47 per cent drop in profit after tax from Sh372 million in 2015 to Sh28 million last year.Speaking during the release of the results yestersday, the group finance director Samuel Kariuki said restructuring of the bank&rsquo;s products during re-branding and the introduction of interest rate cap contributed largely to its poor performance.Centum said the group&rsquo;s realised gains decreased from Sh5.4 billion in 2016 to Sh1.4 billion in 2017.Unlike the group&rsquo;s financial subsidiary whose net profit dropped, the Fast Moving Consumer Goods arm recorded a 76 per cent growth in profit year-on-year, with largely driven by Almasi Beverages.Almasi&rsquo;s Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation grew by 28 per cent in 2016 to Sh2 billion compared to Sh1.58 billion in 2015.Profit from co-investments and other operations dropped by 21 per cent from Sh9.61billion to Sh7.51billion, Centum reported.&ldquo;As at December 2016, we had invested Sh5.47 billion in different sectors as we aim to generate 35 per cent annualised returns by 2019 and consistently outperform the market ,&rdquo; said the group&rsquo;s chief executive James Mworia.Out of the Sh5.47 billion new investments, Sh2.5 billion is in real estate, Sh1.1 billion in FMCG sector, Sh596 million on financial services, while the balance is divided among the education, agribusiness, power and other sectors. Centum plans to focus on development of bankable projects across key sectors in its subsidiaries, leverage on internal resources to de-risk projects, focus on operationalisation and growth, and leverage on third-party capital and project-specific debt.The group has recommended a dividend payout of Sh1.2 per share, representing an increase of 20 per cent compared to the previous year.
