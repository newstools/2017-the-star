The Nakuru government has laid off more than 400 casual labourers in unclear circumstances, with enforcement and environment officers who have worked for more than 10 years being the most affected.The move comes a week after the county public service board hired 130 enforcement officers, despite the county assembly outlawing the recruitment.Lakeview MCA Simon Wanyoike expressed his dismay and anger over the move, adding that the Labour Committee had stopped the recruitment. The casual workers said they will go to the Labour Court to stop the sacking.In a letter signed by Phillip Sigei, the county chief officer in charge of Public Service Management, all subcounty administrators have been directed to disengage the services of the casuals.In the letter dated June 21, Sigei says the budget for 2017-18 had not been approved and the workers&rsquo; salaries had not been catered for.&ldquo;In order to avoid debts in the form of casual wages, I am directing you to disengage any casual labourers working under you with effect from 30th June 2017,&rdquo; the letter states.A source in the county government said, &ldquo;The county Public Service Board has hired 130 enforcement officers who are relatives of senior county officers and ignored those who have served as casuals for 15 years,&rdquo; the source said.Speaking last week, county secretary Joseph Motari confirmed the hiring had been going on and pointed an accusing finger at the public board.He said the board is an autonomous institution and neither he nor the governor has the powers to stop it.
