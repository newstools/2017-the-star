President Uhuru Kenyatta has been asked not to endorse candidates for any elective seat when he visits Laikipia. He is expected to visit the county next week.Independent candidate for Laikipia governor Nderitu Muriithi&rsquo;s running mate and Umande MCA Mwangi Maruga yesterday said it would be a great disservice for him if he endorses any candidate during the campaign tour. On Thursday last week, supporters of Laikipia Governor Joshua Irungu and his main opponent Muriithi almost disrupted an UhuRuto Express campaign rally in Nanyuki town, after they engaged each other in a shouting match.It took the intervention of Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau to cool the tempers in Central Park down, after the crowd shouted down every leader who addressed them.Some shouted Nderitu&rsquo;s name while others shouted NASA.Kamau said the main agenda of the rally was to encourage voters to come out in large numbers on August 8 to reelect President Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto.&ldquo;Ours is to campaign for the reelection of the President and his deputy. Hiyo ingine ya hapa mnaweza jipanga (You will decide for yourselves on local leaders),&rdquo; Kamau said. Campaigning in various parts of Segera and Umande wards yesterday, Mwaniki and Maruga termed the Jubilee Party primaries shambolic.&ldquo;In Nyeri, Kirinyaga and Meru counties, the President was told by residents not to tell voters to vote in a six-piece pattern. When he visits us, let him ask for his votes and leave people of Laikipia to make their own decision for the other seats,&rdquo; Mwaniki said. Supporters of Laikipia East MP Anthony Mutahi, an independent, and those of Jubilee candidate Mohammed Amin also engaged each other in the park.
