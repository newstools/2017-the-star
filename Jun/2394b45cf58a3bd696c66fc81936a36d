Nurses in Kiambu county have promised to remain fixed in their pursuit to have their CBA with the Council of Governors signed.They said they wouldn&rsquo;t resume duties, despite threats and intimidation of being sacked. They added that their plight must be addressed first.The nurses took to the streets of Thika town on Wednesday to display their solidarity with their colleagues countrywide. They demanded the immediate solution of the matter by the Salaries and Remuneration Commission and the CoG.Speaking during the protests, the Kenya National Union of Nurses Kiambu branch secretary John Njoroge said the CoG is to blame for patients&rsquo; suffering as they are the ones delaying the signing of the agreement.&ldquo;Until the CBA is signed and served in a court of law we will not return to work. We regret the suffering of our patients, but our grievances must first be heard,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;We are, therefore, urging the CoG to act swiftly because the faster they sign and implement the agreement, the better for Kenyans.&rdquo; The secretary exonerated the Kiambu county government from blame, saying the county has been addressing their problems. He said their problem is with the CoG.The nurses presented their petition to the Kiambu deputy director in charge of Nursing services, Mary Gatheca, seeking intervention.They threatened to forcefully eject some nurses who are still working in Thika Level 5 and Kiambu Level 4 hospitals, saying they are betraying their colleagues. &ldquo;We are all pushing for a cake that will be divided equally and, therefore, those defying our pursuit will have to do it by force because no one is more special,&rdquo; one nurse said.The nurses downed their tools on June 5 over a pay dispute with the employer. They are also seeking the implementation of their CBA.However, the CoG has said the Sh40 billion CBA is too expensive and cannot be honoured.
