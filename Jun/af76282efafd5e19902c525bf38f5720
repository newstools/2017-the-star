Murang&rsquo;a Senator Kembi Gitura has criticised Kiharu MP Irungu Kang&rsquo;ata for leading protests against independent candidates during President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s visit last Wednesday.He termed it unfortunate for leaders seeking elective positions to spearhead such unrest over claims that independent candidates are not loyal to the President.&ldquo;For me, being in the entourage was a political statement that even though I&rsquo;m vying as an independent, what I&rsquo;ve been telling people, that I support the President, is true,&rdquo; Gitura said.He is seeking reelection as an independent. He lost in the JP primaries to Kang&rsquo;ata.&ldquo;I did not invite myself to that tour. I was invited by the organisers as the senator of Murang&rsquo;a county as was every other leader in attendance,&rdquo; Gitura said.JP candidates, led by Kang&rsquo;ata, and independents confronted one another, the latter being accused of abandoning the party after losing in the nominations.This took place at Blue Post Hotel as they waited for the President.The JP candidates said the independents had no business attending a party event and asked them to leave.Gitura said the tour was not a JP affair, but a normal presidential visit that required all local leaders to be present to welcome him.He said the event was also attended by many other leaders who are not party nominees.&ldquo;Several government officers, including Cabinet Secretaries and Principal Secretaries, were also in attendance because it was an official government event,&rdquo; the outgoing Senate Deputy Speaker added.He urged residents to be wary of leaders who thrive on heckling, saying they do not deserve to be elected.&ldquo;They should have asked me to leave, instead of organising protests,&rdquo; Gitura said.&ldquo;Why were Jubilee Party nominees so disturbed by the presence of independent candidates yet they were not allowed to address the crowds?&rdquo;Gitura said residents present at the function are the same people they woo every day to support Uhuru&rsquo;s reelection and there was no cause for alarm.He urged voters to choose sober leaders who will fix their problems for the next five years. He told leaders to stop propaganda and instead engage in meaningful debates.He urged voters to choose sober leaders who will fix their problems for the next five years.
