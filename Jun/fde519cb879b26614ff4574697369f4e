Lunga lunga MP candidate Kassim Pojjo has warned leaders against using the mineral agenda in their campaigns to win votes from desperate wananchi. Pojjo (pictured) said if they discuss the matter in public, they risk being charged with contempt of court because  a case involving minerals valued at Sh5.4 trillion, the Mrima Hill issue, is pending in an international court. Last month, President Uhuru Kenyatta warned Kwale governor aspirant Chirau Mwakwere against making claims that his administration is only interested in stealing minerals and land in the region. Addressing Lunga Lunga residents,  Uhuru threatened if the ambassador continues to malign his government, he will expose him because the state has all his files. But Mwakwere dared the President saying “nobody threatens Mwakwere”. because “I have documentary evidence to show who signed the licence for Cortec and Base Titanium”. Addressing journalists after attending a burial of two members of one family in Lunga Lunga on Saturday,  Pojjo said the mineral issue is “very sensitive” and should be handled with a lot of care. “The most important thing to know is how wananchi will benefit from minerals and how the poisonous fumes coming from Mrima Hill will be managed so as not to hurt the population,” he said. Pojjo said Jubilee should stop using the issue to gain political mileage, and desist from  hoodwinking residents they will tarmack roads. “If the Kinango-Samburu road has not been tarmacked, not even an inch, after being launched some months ago, do you think the Vanga-Lunga Lunga road will be tarmacked?” he said.
