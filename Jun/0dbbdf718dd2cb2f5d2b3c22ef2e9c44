Chances of Kipchoge Keino Stadium, Eldoret hosting the 2018 Africa Nations Championships (CHAN) looks bleak if developments this week is anything to go byA day after Caf and Football Kenya Federation expressed dissatisfaction with the pace of renovations at the stadium, cabinet secretary Hassan Wario stormed the facility early yesterday morning.Wario arrived at the gates to the stadium only to find that there was nobody in sight to open them, directing that the padlock be broken to gain access.The cabinet secretary, who has been missing in action in recent days insisted he was on a mission to inspect venues all over the country but the early morning impromptu visit suggested that all was not well.Interestingly, he revealed that he is yet to meet the CAF delegation, led by Caf vice president Omari Selemani, but sources revealed he has been in contact with the seven-man inspection team since they started their duties on Monday.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if they are in the country because I have not met with them,&rdquo; Wario said. &ldquo;I am on my tour inspecting the stadia that the Jubilee government is building. From here I will head to Kamariny in Iten. I came here on my own volition.&rdquo;However, Wario curiously claimed that they are lining up back-up stadia if Kipchoge Keino Stadium is not ready in time to host the matches when the tournament kick off in January.]&ldquo;I hope the works will be ready as stipulated. I came here to push the team and in two months we will be done. Remember we have back-up plans but our wish is to bring football to the grassroots,&rdquo; he added.Moi Sports Centre Kasarani, Nyayo, Kinoru Stadium in Meru and Kenyatta Stadium, Machakos are among the stadia that Wario believes will be available for the championship, which features players only based on African soil.&ldquo;We will burn the midnight oil in order to ensure that everything is ready for the Chan,&rdquo; he said. At the same time Wario said plans to replant standard grass in all the football pitches to host the championships have been finalised.A special team from Caf will fly in to ensure that the task is completed ahead of the tournament.&ldquo;The playing grounds are horrible but there is a specific business for planting grass. Caf will recommend a special grass and they will fly in they experts for that,&rdquo; he said.
