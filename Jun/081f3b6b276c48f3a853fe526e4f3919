President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto have told Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago, his rival Bundotich Buzeki and other regional leaders to cool the political temperatures and avoid tribal politics.Uhuru made the plea after meeting Jubilee candidates from the region at State Lodge in Eldoret.He urged politicians to carry out civilised campaigns and ask for votes without playing the tribal card or issuing threats.&ldquo;Even if someone is a hawker, we have to respect them. We have to learn to coexist as a nation, because, without peace and unity, there will be no country for us to lead,&rdquo; he said. Ruto, who was at the meeting, said the region is largely cosmopolitan, and politicians should compete based on policies and agenda, not tribe and other &ldquo;irrelevant issues&rdquo;.&ldquo;Our interest as Jubilee and the government is to unite all Kenyans and none of us should work in the opposite direction. Our agenda should be common for the good of our country,&rdquo; he said.Those present included Mandago, Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi, woman representative candidate Gladys Shollei and Senate hopeful Margaret Kamar.Buzeki, who is vying for governor as an independent candidate, was not present at any of the meetings at State Lodge as he had lined up his own campaign activities throughout the four days Uhuru and Ruto were in the region. Ruto had asked him to step down from the race and back Mandago, but Buzeki has defied the plea and intensified his campaigns, insisting the people of Uasin Gishu will have the final say on who to elect on August 8.&ldquo;I have made it clear that I am in the race to the end and there is no backing down. My brother Mandago should be ready to faceoff with me and in the unlikely situation that he wins, I will accept the results and back him. I am headed for a win and he should equally be ready to accept the results,&rdquo; he said.Ruto said Mandago won the primaries and deserves to be supported by all those who lost, including Buzeki.&ldquo;Waswahili husema asiyekubali kushindwa si mshindani [He who does not accept loss is not a true competitor],&rdquo; he said.In February, the businessman denied claims Ruto was sponsoring him to run against Mandago. Yesterday, Buzeki received a warm reception at the New KCC factory in Eldoret in the presence of Uhuru and Ruto.
