Mombasa Wiper governor candidate Hassan Omar has said his administration will unite all religions in the county to ensure peaceful co-existence.He said he will ensure peace prevails among Muslims, Christians and Hindus, among other religions.&ldquo;As we move towards the end of Ramadhan, I urge you people of Mombasa to promote religious and social cohesion so that Mombasa becomes one community,&rdquo; Omar said.He spoke during his Grand Annual Iftar on Wednesday evening in the Burhani Sports grounds. The Mombasa senator took a swipe at religious leaders who openly campaign for politicians. He called them sycophants. Omar said religious leaders should promote peace and cohesion.&ldquo;I want this sheikh to be accepted during political periods and other times. Our religious leaders have a duty to lead the masses to be better people.&ldquo;It is not possible to be a religious leader while you are a sycophant who leads people astray,&rdquo; Omar said.He said peaceful polls starts with peace messages from religious leaders.&ldquo;I go to non-Muslim&rsquo;s houses and invite the non-Muslims to my house so as to negate the stereotype that Islam is a violent religion, non-tolerant and hateful of other religions,&rdquo; Omar said.Being sycophants, he noted, only gives a sense that a person supports one side and not the other, which sows seeds of discord from the members of the other divide that feels left out.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to invite a Sheikh to my function and people say he is my campaigner and supporter. I want a sheikh to love me because of my diligence and ideals,&rdquo; Omar said.He said religious pulpits should not be used for political purposes because the clergy will lose respect.
