Nairobi governor aspirant Peter Kenneth has accused incumbent Evans Kidero of mismanaging Sh100 billion in four years.He said if given another term, Kidero will bring Nairobi to its knees "just as he chewed Mumias like sugarcane"."We know there are farmers somewhere who are crying so we must be very very careful that we do not cry in Nairobi," Kenneth said on Wednesday. Kenneth spoke at his offices when he unveiled his running running mate Dan Shikanda.Shikanda is a former Harambee Stars winger. Kenneth promised to rid Nairobi of garbage in 90 days if elected.He said services will be decentralised from City Hall, and each constituency will have firefighters, garbage trucks, ambulances, planning officers and workers."We want to make Nairobi more friendly."
