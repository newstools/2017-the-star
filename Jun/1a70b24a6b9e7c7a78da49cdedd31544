Some workers and senior Machakos government officials are working with Wiper governor aspirant Wavinya Ndeti to sabotage garbage collection in the county, Governor Alfred Mutua has said.&ldquo;For four years Machakos has been the cleanest in the entire country. How comes all of a sudden in the last three months there is garbage all over the county?&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Kuna watu wamepangwa kisiasa ili wafanye ionekane Mutua hafanyi kazi (there are people politically placed to make it seem like Mutua is not working). This has been orchestrated by Ndeti.&rdquo;Mutua spoke yesterday at KMC estate, Athi River, where he launched the county&rsquo;s garbage clean-up programme.He said some vehicles meant for garbage collection in the county have been grounded after cartels squandered funds allocated for their repair.&ldquo;Pesa za kutengeneza magari, kuweka mafuta na allowances za wanaozoa takataka zinakulwa. Hii programme imepangwa na Wavinya Ndeti (The money meant for vehicle repair, fuel and allowances for garbage collectors have been squandered. This has been planned by Wavinya Ndeti),&rdquo; Mutua added.The governor said some people are being paid by Ndeti to go on social media and show how Machakos county is filthy due to uncollected garbage.He said his office is investigating the matter and those linked to the sabotage will be arrested and sued.Mutua said Ndeti is desperate and playing politics with residents&rsquo; lives to win the Machakos governor race on August 8.&ldquo;Shame on you Wavinya Ndeti. Wewe unacheza siasa na maisha ya wananchi (You are playing politics with citizens' lives). That is the rate of the desperation,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Sasa sisi hatuchezi na maisha ya watu, sisi ni chap chap development (We are not playing with people's lives; we are pro-development).&rdquo;Mutua pledged to give workers at the Solid Waste Management department overtime allowances.He said those who have been squandering the workers&rsquo; allowances must pay for them.Mutua said the chief officer in charge of Solid Waste Management and Sanitation, Collins Sila, has been moved to the Special Programmes department under office of the county secretary.
