Maisha Magic also flew in Bollywood top thespians; Neelima Bajpal and Shyamashis Bhattacharia, Directors at Shakuntalam Telefilms in India,&nbsp; for a knowledge transfer session.&nbsp;Shyamashis Bhattacharia, while speaking at the summit, acknowledged the role that TV plays in growing the Bollywood film industry. He said, &ldquo;TV appearances are just as popular as Film appearances in India. However, most revenue is generated from TV and not film as most advertising and product placement happens on TV. Television gives film actors an opportunity to make guest appearances to promote their films, and this is the key that propels the Bollywood film industry as it gives the cast members more popularity. This has worked in Hollywood and would also work well with local Kenyan film productions.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;
