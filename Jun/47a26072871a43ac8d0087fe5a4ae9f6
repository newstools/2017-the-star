Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has dismissed Monday&rsquo;s NASA rally in Machakos, saying it will not sway the voters.The Maendeleo Chap Chap leader said the campaign mounted by Raila Odinga and Kalonzo Musyoka, among other NASA leaders, for governor candidate Wavinya Ndeti is a clear indication the alliance feels threatened.&ldquo;The NASA rally did not assist Ndeti&rsquo;s candidature. They had to ferry supporters in lorries from Nairobi to get a crowd. The real voters stayed away,&rdquo; the governor told the Star on the phone yesterday.&ldquo;The people of Machakos have decided. What they want is development and they know where that can be found, and that is in Maendeleo Chap Chap.&rdquo;On Monday, the NASA brigade campaigned for Ndeti at a rally in Machakos town.The NASA principals and governors, senators and MPs tore into Mutua&rsquo;s administration, saying he does not deserve a second chance.Raila accused the governor of political betrayal.&ldquo;Your governor is a man of mere theatrics, full of empty talk. He promised to build a city here in Machakos, Was that achieved? He thinks the people of Machakos are stupid, but we are telling him, his time is over,&rdquo; Raila said.The opposition chief said the governor&rsquo;s idea of a new city was a political game plan by Jubilee to kill Konza City and deny the Kamba community opportunities that came with the project.&ldquo;The whole plan was not only for the governor to get himself close to President Uhuru Kenyatta to protect himself from corruption cases, but also to kill the Konza City project, which the government did not want to implement,&rdquo; Raila said.Bungoma Senator and NASA co-principal Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula urged Machakos people to vote out governor Mutua.
