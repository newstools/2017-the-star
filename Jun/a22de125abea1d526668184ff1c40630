A British woman whom police said was thrown off the 5th floor of their apartment complex in Lavington by her Kenyan boyfriend has spoken out about the ordeal.Tinu Collins, 25, is still in hospital after she was left with a broken spine, left leg and right ankle.Speaking to Manchester Evening News, Tinu said that her Kenyan boyfriend, Trapking Chrome, did not throw her off the balcony but rather she slipped and fell during an argument.Tinu said: &ldquo;Basically I was a bit drunk sitting on the balcony to get a bit of fresh air. I was having an argument with my boyfriend. My foot slipped. I grabbed onto the railings to pull myself up, but I couldn&rsquo;t and fell from the fifth floor. I was conscious when I fell.&rdquo;Trapking Chrome added, "Everyone&rsquo;s saying I&rsquo;m the one who&rsquo;s pushed my fianc&eacute;e, but the truth is I didn&rsquo;t push her. I was in the living room. She went outside to get some fresh air and she slipped. It happened in a matter of seconds.&rdquo;He continued, "I ran downstairs immediately. She was laying down on the floor, screaming. That&rsquo;s how I knew she was alive, because she was making a noise. I thought she had died. It&rsquo;s pretty high up. But she&rsquo;s alive. Thank God she&rsquo;s alive.&rdquo;Tinu and Trapking&rsquo;s friends have now launched a fundraising drive to pay for her treatment. They are appealing for help saying, "She's been undergoing serious and critical treatment and operations which are very costly. She happens to be in one of the best hospitals where she's been admitted to for her aid. And that's where the story begins as the bills to fund the treatment are costly and she doesn't have medical insurance to cover."
