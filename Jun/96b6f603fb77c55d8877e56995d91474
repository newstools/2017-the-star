Nyeri governor hopeful Thuo Mathenge is pushing a last-minute bid to be allowed to contest as a Jubilee candidate in the August 8 General Election.Mathenge had been given a nomination certificate on June 2 to fly Jubilee&rsquo;s flag, but the party&rsquo;s dispute committee rejected his candidature a week later on grounds his degree from a Ugandan university is questionable.Through lawyer Kioko Kilukumi, the businessman, in an application filed at the Milimani law court yesterday, said the decision revoking his nomination after he was cleared to run violates his rights.Mathenge says after a probe, the Director of Public Prosecutions found no sufficient evidence to prove his academic papers were not genuine.He wants the court to suspend the decision by the Jubilee Party revoking his nomination, pending hearing of the application.
