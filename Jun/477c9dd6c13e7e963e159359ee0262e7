Governor aspirant Miguna Miguna was finally cleared yesterday after he was turned away in the morning for&nbsp;submitting signatures in JPEG format. The commission asked him to present the list in Excel format for easy verification.Miguna was, however, not given a clearance certificate because he did not submit his campaign schedule.Miguna also dropped his running mate 24-year-old James Githungu, and replaced him with Karen Wangenye. In total, six aspirants were cleared, including Governor Evans Kidero and Senator Mike Sonko.Kidero asked the county returning officer Joseph Mele to rein in candidates who will incite violence during campaigns. Mele said,&nbsp; &nbsp; "I want to assure you that as a commission, we will adhere to the law and we shall impose sanctions on any candidate who will violate the code of conduct."Kidero and Deputy Governor Jonathan Mueke expressed confidence they will recapture the seat. &nbsp; "Our track speaks for itself and we are telling our opponents to be prepared," Kidero said.He accused Sonko of not defending the county for the four years he has been in senator.&nbsp; "Currently, the national government owes us Sh72 billion. The revenue allocation formula does not favour us. The senator has never [defended] us. If he cannot manage a simple debate in the Senate, how can he run this county?" Kidero said. The governor, who was accompanied by his wife, Susan, proceed to Baba Dogo grounds for a rally immediately after clearance. Michael Mutinda of Agano Party, Macharia Kamau of Party of Democratic Unity and Godfrey Wanyoike, an independent, were cleared as well.Former Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth, who was defeated by Sonko in the Jubilee nominations, is expected to submit his papers for clearance today to run an independent.
