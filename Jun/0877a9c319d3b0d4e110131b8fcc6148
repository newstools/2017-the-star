There will be sanctions meted out against teams from the top two divisions in the Kenyan football hierarchy who fail to take part in the GOtv Shield starting next season, Football Kenya Federation (FKF) CEO Robert Muthomi has revealed.Speaking after conducting the draw for this year&rsquo;s competition that will kicks off next weekend, Muthomi said they are drawing up rules that will compel teams from the premier league and the national Super League to take part in the country&rsquo;s foremost cup competition.&ldquo;We are putting up regulations to have KPL and NSL teams have a mandatory requirement to take part in the event, failure to which from next year there will be sanctions. This year, four teams will not take part including &mdash;Mathare United, Posta Rangers, Muhoroni Youth and Zoo Kericho, who are yet to feature in the event in its five years of existence,&rdquo; said Muthomi after conducting yesterday draw at the SuperSports headquarters near Jamhuri Park.Muthomi said they are looking to make the competition more rewarding for clubs and plans are underway to ensure that from next season onwards, teams that reach the last sixteen stand to benefit financially.The draw itself came up with intriguing match ups not least for Nairobi Water, who were handed a baptism of fire as they tackle record winners Gor Mahia while SS Assad from Mombasa start their tourney with a home fixture against holders Tusker.Last year&rsquo;s beaten finalist Ulinzi Stars will travel to face Wajiji while Young Divers take on Thika United.
