Zechariah Mulati sustained deep panga cuts to his head and hands in the attack at 4am onSaturday. He was taken to Bungoma West Hospital in Kanduyi. Mulati, fourth year student who hails from Sirisia constituency, was with his fiancee in his house a few meters from the institution. Neighbour Alice Wasike said she heard screams and saw about five men attacking the student with rungus and pangas when she peeped through her window. She said she also screamed, attracting neighbours.

Mulati's fiancee was slapped and did not suffer serious injuries. Mulati's schoolmates held peaceful demonstrations, demanding the arrest of the assailants. Student leader Kelvince Fwamba said the attackers were well-known. He gave Bungoma county commissioner Joshua Chepchieng an ultimatum of 48 hours to arrest the criminals. "We also warn politicians who park big vehicles outside the university in the evening to keep off this place." Fwamba said the vehicle will be burned and also asked politicians to keep their affairs outside the school.
