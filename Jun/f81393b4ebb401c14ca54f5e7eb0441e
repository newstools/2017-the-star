Presidential candidate Abduba Dida is seeking to stop next month's presidential debates by media houses on grounds of discrimination. Dida, in an urgent petition filed at Milimani law courts on Friday, wants the Media Council of Kenya and The Debate Media Limited barred from going on with the plan. The first debate is slated for July 10 while running mates will argue their bids on July 17. The final presidential debate will be held on July 24. Read: Only Uhuru, Raila to take part in presidential debates Dida is among eight presidential candidates cleared by IEBC to face off with President Uhuru Kenyatta in the August 8 elections. Others are Cyrus Jirongo of United Democratic Party (UDP), Ekuru Aukot
of Thirdway Alliance, and Independents Joseph Nyagah, Michael Wainaina
and Japheth Kavinga. The politician has accused the debate organisers of categorising candidates in terms of their popularity and treating him as a second class presidential candidate. "It is in the interest of justice that all the candidates should be accorded the same status as required by law when they are outlining their visions for the country." The Alliance for Real Change (ARC) flag bearer says guidelines set by the organisers are discriminatory, in bad faith, and contrary to the constitution. His argument is that organisers have not offered a level playing field for all aspirants. Dida wants the court to declare that all candidates are equal with regards to articulating their manifestos. "The categorisation of presidential candidates in terms of so-called public opinions will be prejudicial to my interest as a presidential candidate," he said in the suit. "This will be to the extent that some of the presidential candidates will be elevated to the detriment of others." All the debates will be held at Catholic University of Eastern Africa at 7.30pm and will be aired by all participating media houses on television and radio stations.
