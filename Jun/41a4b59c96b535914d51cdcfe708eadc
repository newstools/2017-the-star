The Kenya Muslim National Advisory Council chair Sheikh Juma Ngao has vowed to rally the Muslim population against President Uhuru&rsquo;s reelection.Ngao says Muslims have not appointed a spokesperson to speak on their behalf.Muslims are slightly more than 10 million in number, about 35 per cent of the Kenyan population.Speaking to the Star on Monday, Ngao said those who went to State House, Nairobi, two weeks ago, and told President Uhuru Kenyatta all Muslims are behind him lied.&ldquo;They were only after food,&rdquo; he said on the phone. &ldquo;Muslims are not pocketed by other Muslim leaders. The truth is that only a few Muslims will vote for Jubilee.&rdquo; The Muslim cleric, who is also PNU vice chairman, fell out with Jubilee leaders about two years ago.He campaigned for the election of President Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto in 2013.This was after ditching Cord&rsquo;s camp.He is now supporting NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga.On Monday, Ngao said the Jubilee administration has given Muslims, especially those from the Coast and North Eastern, a raw deal.&ldquo;The Jubilee government has treated Muslims as second-class citizens,&rdquo; the cleric said. He said Jubilee has neglected areas with majority of Muslims in government subsidies.Ngao cited the Sh1 billion given to miraa farmers in Meru, the writing off of coffee and tea debts owed to national government by farmers in the Central and Rift Valley regions and the Sh900 million for the revival of Pan Paper factory in Western, among others.&ldquo;In the Coast, from Vanga to Taita Taveta, to Malindi, Tana River and Lamu, no farmer has been funded with money to do agriculture. &ldquo;We have not heard the government give North Eastern farmers funds in subsidies. These are two regions that host many Muslims,&rdquo; Sheikh Ngao said. Instead, he said, the government is planning to build a dry port in Naivasha at the expense of some 10,000 families in the Coast that depend on the port services.Uhuru, while hosting the Muslim leaders and scholars, said his administration has been the most Muslim-friendly of all the regimes Kenya has had.
