ODM has warned MP John Waluke against threatening its Sirisia MP candidate Moses Nandalwe. Nandalwe said his life is in danger. He recorded a statement at the Central police station, saying he received threats from JP politicians, including Waluke, through phone calls, texts and verbal attacks. Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi told IG Joseph Boinnet to provide adequate security to Nandalwe. He said Waluke will be held accountable for any crime committed against Nandalwe. Nandalwe said Waluke and his group have accused him of being behind an incident last month in which DP William Ruto’s convoy was almost blocked in Misikhu on his way to Kimilili’s  Amutala Stadium.
