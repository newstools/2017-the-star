Secondary school principals have passed 16 resolutions in the just-ended 42nd Kenya Secondary School Heads&rsquo; Association Annual Conference at Wild Waters in Mombasa.The more than 8,000 principals, led by Kessha chairman Indimuli Kahi, have agreed to support peaceful polls and abide by the ministerial requirement of being politically non-aligned.&ldquo;We promise to keep our schools and resources free from politics and political activities,&rdquo; said the principals in the resolutions read out by their secretary Grace Watuku.They have also agreed to tackle violent extremism in schools.Many secondary schoolchildren, especially at the Coast, were victims of extremism radicalisation.The principals agreed to support the ongoing curriculum reforms and commit to continue playing their role in ensuring its successful implementation.They also said they will work closely with the Teachers&rsquo; Service Commission, support implementation of performance contracts and work with the Kenya National Examinations Council to ensure the integrity of national exams is restored.The principals called on the TSC to harmonise the medical scheme for teachers by tackling the confusion arising from using AON and National Hospital Insurance Funds cards.&ldquo;Ensure the AON card is acceptable in most hospitals across the country and also disclose charges incurred upon getting services,&rdquo; read parts of the resolutions.They supported the recommendation by the Ministry of Education to review the Basic Education Act to remove students from the Board of Management and reduce the number of members.On Tuesday, Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang&rsquo;i said the inclusion of students in the Board of Management led to the increase in cases of indiscipline.&ldquo;We shall ensure the students&rsquo; participation in school administration is well monitored and guided by both principals and teachers,&rdquo; said the principals.Kessha and the TSC will embark on establishing the Principal Code of Conduct after the collective bargaining agreement elevated the principals&rsquo; status.TSC chief executive Nancy Macharia said, &ldquo;Much is now expected from the principals who will be paid responsibility allowances and for any other additional job.&rdquo;Secondary school teachers welcomed plans by both the opposition and the administration to introduce free secondary education next year.Kahi said, however, it&rsquo;s necessary to expand infrastructure and increase the number of teaching staff for the programme to be effective.He said teachers are ready for the new programme.&ldquo;First, we should ensure the infrastructure is in place to handle the increased number of children joining secondary schools,&rdquo; he said.Kahi said the country has a shortage of teachers and it will be difficult for the programme to run smoothly if the teacher-student ratio is too big.
