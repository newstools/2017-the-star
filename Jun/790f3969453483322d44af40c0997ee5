Lisa Kieti: I remember dating a guy like this&hellip;smh! Don&rsquo;t ignite his fire by responding to his texts. Go cold turkey&hellip;. Cut off communication and live your life Vee. It&rsquo;s hard I know but try ignore him as much as possible. Don't let him control you even passively. I will pray for Gods peace to surround you.Rauha Paulus: It feels like de ja vu. Only, it&rsquo;s not! I was in a similar relationship recently. Threats, blackmails, promises, insults. It&rsquo;s a circle. Why I relate to Vee it&rsquo;s because I remained as calm. Answer in such a very intelligent manner. Sometimes I hardly reply. It gets better with time. And you become numb to all bad things thrown at you. I think you are an amazing person, Vee one love.Francene Chettle: I was engaged to a Yoruba, he was controlling and violent possessive. I ain't saying they are all like that, But I'vebeen in other relationships like this. It don't get any better but worse. Best you've got out of it now.
