The National Council of Churches of Kenya wants the IEBC to publish the voters register audit report by KPMG.NCCK secretary general Peter Karanja said, &ldquo;Consider and verify the voters register as the bedrock of a credible election come the General Election in August.&ldquo;It is important that you constantly apprise and update Kenyans on your processes to reassure them that the register is devoid of all anomalies.&rdquo;Karanja added that all election disputes that emerged in the 2007 election were due to the perceived delays in the announcement of results, leading to accusations of manipulated results.&ldquo;The dramatic failure of the electronic voter identification device in 2013 was a great disappointment to Kenyans.We must ensure the disappointment is not repeated again in the 2017 General Election ... I call upon the IEBC to move with speed to conduct national verification and testing of the entire system. This will assure Kenyans on the functionality of the entire IEBC systems,&rdquo; he said.
