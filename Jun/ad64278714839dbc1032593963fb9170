NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga has promised servant leadership and to lower the cost of living within 100 days if elected as Kenya&rsquo;s fifth President.NASA will not tolerate autocratic leadership that Jubilee has employed during its tenure, he said.&ldquo;NASA government will lower the cost of living within 100 days. We shall strive to ensure the country&rsquo;s economy has changed and many job opportunities have been created.We shall also ensure that nursery, primary and secondary education students access free education. We are not Jubilee whose promises have failed to be realised,&rdquo; Raila said.He spoke at the weekend in Busia county when he made stopovers at Mau Mau, Port Victoria, Ganga, Funyula and Bumala. Raila said he will increase the cash for elderly persons from the current Sh2,000 to Sh3,500.&ldquo;We shall retain the chiefs contrary to claims by Jubilee that we shall fire them. The salaries for the police will also be increased to stop the culture of &lsquo;kitu kidogo&rsquo; on artificial road blocks and arbitrary arrest of chang&rsquo;aa drinkers,&rdquo; he said.Raila cited the laptop projects, 10,000km of tarmacked roads and job opportunities among other pledges Jubilee had made to Kenyans but has not fully implemented.He slammed the Uhuru administration for taking over projects that he initiated when he was the Prime Minister and minister for Roads and Transport.&ldquo;The Sigiri Bridge is a good example of the project he initiated. Uhuru, who was then the minister for Finance, refused to release the funds for the project. I was also behind the tarmacking of Mayoni-Port Victoria road.He is now using the bridge to cheat the people of Busia that he knows their problems more than me. The President is only interested in your votes and not in helping you,&rdquo; Raila said.He said his government will end the arbitrary arrests of Kenyan fishermen on Lake Victoria by Ugandan security officers and Migingo Island will be reverted to Kenya.
