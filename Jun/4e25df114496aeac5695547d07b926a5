Garissa Senator Yussuf Haji yesterday dismissed claims that he is too old and does not deserve a second term.Haji, a former long-serving provincial administrator and a three-term Ijara MP, is 77 years old.He told his rivals that he is still fit.&ldquo;In Somali, we have a proverb that says a homestead that does not have an elder with grey hair should get one, even if it means buying. Old age is not a disability or disease,&rdquo; Haji said.He spoke to the press in his office yesterday after meeting elders from Governor Nathif Jama&rsquo;s Aulian clan and women from his Samawadhal clan.Haji said he is happy with the support he has so far received from different quarters. Haji also defended himself against accusations that he has failed to play his oversight role by not pointing out the misuse of public resources in Jama&rsquo;s administration.&ldquo;Those accusing me, including my opponents, should direct their grievances elsewhere,&rdquo; he said.Haji said he has helped to push for more than Sh30 billion and send it to the county for four years.He said he has, on many occasions, tried to personally speak to the governor to express his dissatisfaction on how he was running the county, but Jama would hear none of it. &ldquo;I have also written countless letters to the governor to point out what I thought was mismanagement of county resources.&rdquo;Haji went on, &ldquo;I have tried my best to reconcile the governor and the county MPs more than five times to create harmony. I wonder what people mean when they say I did not play my oversight role correctly.&rdquo;He urged the electorate to vote for Ali Korane for governor, citing an agreement which brings together the Abduwak and the Samawadhal clans, dubbed the Telamuge Alliance.&ldquo;I have closely worked with Korane for many years and I can say without any fear of contradiction that he is a person who can be entrusted with our resources and do a far much better job,&rdquo; Haji said.
