The group has been moving door-todoor selling Jubilee in Mombasa. On Saturday, the group toured several parts of Mvita constituency as they preached peace. &ldquo;Apart from selling the Jubilee agenda, we have become peace ambassadors, spreading the message that there is life after the General Election,&rdquo; Warda said. She said the lobby has 47 county chairpersons, who oversee the activities of the 20-member committees in each constituency.
