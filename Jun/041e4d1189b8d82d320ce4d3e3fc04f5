A Meru senator aspirant Kobia Maranya (pictured) has promised to root for the construction of Meru-Mombasa super highway, which will pass through Kitui. He said the road will shorten the distance between Meru and  Mombasa. “I will lobby for this road. It must be a super highway with eight lanes,four on each side. Mombasa is only 375 kilometres from Meru if the road is built,” the independent candidate said, adding it will boost tourism. Maranya spoke at Ruiri market, North Imenti, on Tuesday.
