Early one recent morning, when we entered the park through the east gate, everything looked so dry and in need of rain. Right then we decided that our drive was not going to be fast and far, but rather to be slower and shorter. &ldquo;Driving in circles&rdquo; on the exact same loops often reveals completely different sightings when repeated. The drive was very rewarding, with so much game still in the Athi basin. We managed four different lion sightings, including the Lioness Athi and her two cubs, the young King Sirikoi, and others, due to repeated slow driving along river and dam routes.It is interesting that there have been many occasions over the years when &ldquo;hidden species&rdquo; pop up on the return drive when we missed them the first time. The reality is that when vehicles are moving and species, especially predators, are camouflaged, the possibility of sighting them is restricted, unless they reveal their position by movement like standing up. It is also good practice while driving in loops to simply stop and quietly wait and survey the area for a few minutes. Often, the behaviour of other species like herbivores can reveal the possible location of predators. I always tell people that when going &ldquo;bird watching&rdquo;, many other interesting species can &ldquo;get in the way&rdquo; of your enjoyment and interest.So once again, our method of slow &ldquo;driving in circles&rdquo; for a short distance bore fruit. Many vehicles go through the gate and drive fast and far for many hours in the heat and dust with lesser rewards and exhausted people. So why not try the &ldquo;repeat the route&rdquo; method? Hopefully you will all enjoy many interesting sightings.The park is open daily from 06h00 to 19h00.For more information on the park you can link to the following websites www.kws.org or www.nairobigreenline.com or on Facebook.
