The Kenya National Chambers of Commerce and Industry Kiambu county chapter has asked to be assured of a conducive business environment. Members met Jubilee governor candidate Ferdinand Waititu in Ruaka, Kiambaa constituency, on Monday.They said the current county government did not provide a good environment for the business community and hiked rates, which hurt their businesses."Since devolution, business people in Kiambu have complained and held demonstrations but their grievances fell on deaf ears," chairman Richard Ndung'u said. "Now we have reached out to Waititu's team to tell us how they will address our issues and give us a conducive environment to conduct business without being oppressed."Waititu said once elected he will encourage public participation and have the people of Kiambu make decisions on how they want business conducted.James Nyoro, his running mate, said their government will be people-oriented.
