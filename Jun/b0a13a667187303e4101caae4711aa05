NASA leaders Raila Odinga and Kalonzo Musyoka have reportedly been unsuccessful in their latest efforts to convince Mombasa Senator Hassan Omar to shelve his governor bid.Raila and Kalonzo are said to have offered Omar a government position should they win the August 8 polls, amid worries that the Senator is eating up Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho's support base.In a meeting on Saturday, Omar reportedly turned down the offer saying he has no interest in a position in the national government.He is said to have told the principals he has invested too much in the race to give up now. Omar is gunning for Joho's seat on a Wiper ticket.Read: NASA will punish 'dead horse' governor Joho for forgery, says OmarAlso read: : I am proud of my D- in KCSE, was not as privileged as Uhuru - JohoJoho is said to have attended the meeting at which it was proposed that an opinion poll be conducted to determine the more popular candidate.He said the results would determine who between them should vie for the post in the Opposition. NASA brings together Raila's ODM, Kalonzo's Wiper, Musalia Mudavadi's ANC, Moses Wetang'ula's Ford Kenya and Isaac Rutto's CCM.But Omar reportedly told the coalition principals that if they felt Joho is the stronger candidate, they should have no fears in the general elections. The Senator added, however, that he has done enough to beat Joho in the ballot.Raila is said to have expressed fears that NASA would lose seats to VDP leader Hezron Awiti or Jubilee's Suleiman Shabhal.He also referred to Omar and Joho as his sons and urged them to work together. When contacted by The Star on Wednesday, the Senator said he would address the matter but he had not done so by press time.He was later quoted in the Daily Nation saying: "At the moment there is no turning back because we have already done a lot and gained ground. Whoever might even be thinking of such a thing should forget it."Mombasa county director of communication Richard Chacha told The Star on Thursday there was no such arrangement.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know about it (the meeting),&rdquo; he said, adding that Joho is in the ballot and there would be no opinion poll.&ldquo;He is not going to be subjected to any other test."Read: Joho hijacks Iftar dinner, irritated Omar pulls out amid power tussleWiper Kwale governor candidate Charau Mwakwere confirmed that they attended the meeting, but said they only held discussions on strategies to win the elections.&ldquo;Those are my leaders in NASA and when they are around it is only normal that we are close so that they know they have soldiers on the ground,&rdquo; Mwakwere told the Star on phone.But he said there were no talks of Omar stepping down for Joho."That is what (US) President Donald Trump calls fake news. I don't know about that. I am hearing it from you," he said on Wednesday.ODM candidate Issa Chipera told the Star on Thursday he was also at the meeting and that the discussions were confidential."Mostly it was an emphasis on NASA," he added.Close confidants to the Senator said the same trick was used in the run up to the 2013 general elections."Team Joho has panicked. They were riding on the surge of emotion brought about by the tiff between Joho and President Uhuru Kenyatta, which has now quelled. They have nothing to rely on," said Wiper Jomvu MP candidate Mathais Shipeta.Joho, who is ODM deputy party leader, has been on the campaign trail for NASA over the last few months, a move that has worried his aides.
