An Elgeyo Marakwet governor candidate has said he will not allow county staff to live in the neighbouring Uasin Gishu county if he wins.Moses Changwony, an independent candidate, accused Governor Alex Tolgos&rsquo;s administration of allowing county executives and staff to live in Eldoret town.Changwony said the move has limited the economic growth of Iten town &ndash; the county&rsquo;s headquarters. He said it is unreasonable for the county government to ferry staff from Eldoret using county vehicles. Speaking in Iten on Saturday, Changwony said he will also live within the county if elected in the August 8 polls. He termed the decisions by top county staff to live in Eldoret town as wastage of county funds and time. Tolgos has told Changwony to seek votes from all communities in the county, instead of &lsquo;misusing&rsquo; the Keiyo community for his selfish interests.
