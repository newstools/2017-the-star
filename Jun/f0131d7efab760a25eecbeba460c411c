Traders selling government subsidised flour at Sh140 per 2kg packet instead of Sh90 risk prosecution, Budalang&rsquo;i MP Ababu Namwamba (pictured) has warned. &ldquo;With effect from today, I want chiefs and their assistants in the sub-county to be on high alert and ensure shops within their areas of jurisdiction are selling the maize flour to the consumers at the price recommended by the government and also ensure you report those violating the directive,&rdquo; he said. Namwamba was addressing residents at Budalang&rsquo;i trading centre on Sunday. &ldquo;Those selling the maize flour above the recommended price are out to discredit the effort the Jubilee government has made to ensure Kenyans do not go hungry. But I want to put them on notice that the long arm of the law will soon catch up with them,&rdquo; said the MP.
