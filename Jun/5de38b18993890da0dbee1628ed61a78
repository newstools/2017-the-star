Coffee theft is haunting the industry struggling to survive in Murang&rsquo;a county as the harvest begins.On Monday night, a gang attempted to raid Thangaini coffee factory in Kigumo subcounty.The gang is believed to be part of a cartel behind coffee theft in the county. It tried to access the factory&rsquo;s stores before the thugs were intercepted by a guard who alerted neighbours and the police.It is said the factory&rsquo;s management was to transport the dried coffee to a miller on Friday but the plans stalled after the truck that had been hired arrived late.Farmers also raised concerns that the theft may have been planned by an insider who had information that coffee had not been transported to the miller.Murang&rsquo;a county commissioner John Elungata praised the local community for responding fast.&ldquo;The Nyumba Kumi initiative has been very instrumental in maintaining peace and improved security,&rdquo; Elungata said.He added that all factories are required to instal alarms and sufficient security lights to enable guards to patrol the compounds efficiently.
