Maendeleo Chap Chap leader Alfred Mutua yesterday said his differences with Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka are ideological, not personal.The Machakos governor termed Kalonzo a personal friend, but said he quit Wiper to form his own party after realising its leaders had no development agenda.&ldquo;I respect Kalonzo, he is a decent man. My differences with him are purely ideological,&rdquo; Mutua said.He said during the four years he was a Wiper member, most party meetings never addressed issues affecting the people.&ldquo;I can say without fear of contradiction the meetings were usually used as forums to cut other leaders down to size,&rdquo; Mutua said.The governor said Wiper also lost key leaders like senators Johnson Muthama and David Musila due to lack of focus.&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I quit to form my party before I was fixed,&rdquo; Mutua said.He used stronger language on May 17 when he said he quit Wiper because it tried to sabotage his government. He called its politics retrogressive and said he was &ldquo;tormented&rdquo; during his stay. The MCC boss accused Wiper of supporting MCAs&rsquo; efforts to impeach him and slow his development agenda.Wiper has nothing to offer the Kamba nation, Mutua said at that time.He was speaking at his office where he hosted cooperative society officials. Mutua said his party is confident of winning many county seats. He said he is confident of reelection on August 8. The governor said his party had emerged among the three top parties with the largest number of candidates.&ldquo;In coming years this party will be a force to reckon with. We will offer transformative leadership,&rdquo; Mutua said.Machakos assembly chief whip Timothy Kilonzo said Mutua&rsquo;s development track record is enviable. &ldquo;He has initiated tangible development projects that have impacted positively on the lives of the people,&rdquo; Kilonzo said. He added that Mutua is qualified to run for President in 2022.
