Vets are demanding plum salaries to match Kenyan medical doctors pay.They have also given the government three months to employ 1,500 new vets and raise their salaries to match those of medics.The professionals, who include veterinary surgeons and veterinary doctors, yesterday said they are tired of discrimination by the government.Medics under the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union in March received a pay hike of more than 40 per cent to end their three month-long strike.An intern from university now earns a monthly salary of Sh196,989, up from Sh140,244.Vets said most earn less than what medical interns earn despite having accumulated years of experience.&ldquo;The Salaries and Remuneration Commission must address the issue of unmotivated work force within the veterinary profession by harmonising their salaries and allowances with that of the other health workers as stipulated in the Constitution,&rdquo; said Kenya Veterinary Association chairman Samuel Kahariri.He said animal doctors are just as important as those who treat people because they safeguard the environment that people live in.They have presented a memorandum to the SRC outlining their demands.&ldquo;We expect nothing less than full harmonisation in order to continue offering the essential veterinary services and safeguard the health of animals, human and environment,&rdquo; he said at a press briefing in Nairobi.The meeting was attended by officials of the Kenya Veterinary Paraprofessionals Association and the Kenya Livestock Marketing Council.Kahariri said although the government has started an internship programme for veterinary professionals, they are not paid.&ldquo;We also demand that the government pays the interns stipends that have been outstanding for the last four months without any further delays in order to avoid negating the gains of the veterinary internship programme,&rdquo; he told journalists.The government stopped hiring veterinary surgeons and paraprofessionals while implementing the structural adjustment programmes in the 1980s.The officials urged the government to disband the Kenya Meat Commission Board, accusing it of failing to cushion livestock farmers from losses. &ldquo;The KMC has played a key role in the current food insecurity as a result of incompetence,&rdquo; Kahariri said.
