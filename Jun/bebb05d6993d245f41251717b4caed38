Starring: Tom Cruise, Annabelle Wallis, Sofia Boutella, Jake Johnson, Courtney B. Vance, Marwan Kenzari, Russell CroweDirected by: Alex KurtzmanRelease date: June 9Once again, Hollywood tries to retell an old story with a new cast amidst the tumult of modern cinematography. The Mummy series is a highly successful franchise that started in the early 30s. In the 2017 reboot, Tom Cruise stars as Nick Morton, who stumbles upon the remains of Princess Ahmanet, daughter of the Pharaoh, Menehptre. Ahmanet is resurrected, bringing disaster and leaving havoc in her wake. The movie simply tries too hard; it throws a lot of information and action at the audience. It just barely manages to entertain, mostly because of the captivating performance by Sofia Boutella. Starring: 4/5
