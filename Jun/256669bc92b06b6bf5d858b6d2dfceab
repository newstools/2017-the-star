President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto yesterday launched a blistering attack on Raila Odinga, accusing NASA's presidential candidate of scheming to sabotage the August polls. Speaking in towns along the way to Nyeri, they said the former Prime Minister and NASA were "erecting roadblocks" to the August 8 General Election because they face defeat and know it.They said the opposition's game plan is to delay polls and then push for a nusu mkate, or coalition, transitional government in which it would share power."Today he (Raila) went to court as part of his plot to block Kenyans from voting. Kenyans have a right to vote to choose their leaders," Kenyatta told Karatina town residents.However, Supreme Court Justice David Maraga yesterday said the judiciary will not make any decision that could lead to postponing the election.Raila dismissed the oft-repeated and increasingly shrill accusations of sabotage, saying Kenyatta and Jubilee are panicked because it is they who have sensed defeat."If they they are winning, why are they panicking? The die is cast because Kenyans are determined to execute a revolution and nothing will stop them," Raila said in Kitale.Yesterday NASA made good its threat to seek an injunction stopping the printing of 120 million ballot papers, saying Al Ghurair Printing and Publishing company is in bed with the President. It wants the tender blocked and cancelled.Today the High Court will hear NASA's petition challenging the controversial Sh2.5 billion tender to the Dubai-based firm.The opposition protests that the decision by the electoral body to award the tender was unreasonable, biased and unlawful.NASA appeared before High Court judge George Odunga on Thursday evening but were not heard.Instead, he directed NASA to immediately serve the IEBC, Al Ghurair and the Jubilee Party that sought to be enjoined in the suit.&ldquo;Let the applicant serve the respondents with the suit papers today and parties appear before court tomorrow morning for further directions," Odunga said. On May 29, the IEBC awarded the tender after a protracted legal battle with NASA.Last week the coalition said the President has close ties with the firm's owners.NASA also wants the IEBc compelled to reconsider its decision and cancel the tender.Unless orders are granted, the suit will be worthless and meaningless, considering the fast-approaching polls.CJ Maraga yesterday ruled out the possibility of postponing the election due to court cases.Speaking during groundbreaking for construction of a Sh367 million court building in Homa Bay town, Maraga said the judiciary will strive to ensure the polls take place as scheduled.&ldquo;The judiciary is ready to handle all matters regarding the August 8 General Election, hence, every Kenyan with grievances is welcome to file petitions,&rdquo; he said.The CJ said all cases will be handled with speed, based on evidence and in accordance with the law.NASA's suit filed through Murumba and Awele Advocates also says the tender was awarded without consultations with key stakeholders as constitutionally mandated.&ldquo;By awarding the tender for printing of election materials, knowing very well the fears and suspicions members of the public had against the firm, and without taking into accounts consideration the contribution of stakeholders, IEBC acted unfairly and unlawfully,&rdquo; NASA said.The award was made in total regard of pertinent, available facts, it said, thus, "the decision is illegal, unfair and contravenes the Constitution."&ldquo;Cost effectiveness and similar equally important constitutional precepts of transparency, inclusivity and accountability are expected of every procurement process by a state organ under the constitution," it said.Uhuru and Ruto, on a campaign blitz of Nyeri county, started their day in populous Mathira constituency where they said Raila lacks confidence and is clutching at straws to stall the election processThey said the latest lawsuit indicates NASA is unprepared and resorting to legal action, desperate to share power if it cannot have it all.Uhuru urged Kenyans to remain united and continue to reject opposition attempts to divide them into tribal groupings, calling that a recipe for chaos.&ldquo;Everyone has a right to settle anywhere in the republic so along as he is a Kenyan citizen, regardless of ethnic background,&rdquo; the President said.The Deputy President said the opposition leader was jittery because lacks a credible agenda for progress or a track record to show he cares about Kenyans.record to show he cares about Kenyans.Kenyatta got a rude shock when Karatina residents in Nyeri rejected his plea for six-piece suit voting &mdash; a straight Jubilee ticket and no one else.
