The month-long voter verification drive by the IEBC ends today, with only 20-30 per cent voters turning up.IEBC communications director Andrew Limo attributed the low turnout to most people having verified their registration details through SMS and during the previous two mass voter registration drives.Ten thousand Kenya Integrated Elections Management System gadgets were tested and worked.Limo said verification was necessitated by fears that dead voters are still in the IEBC&rsquo;s register.&ldquo;The requirement for voters to verify their details by use of finger scans or biometrics was provided for as the most stringent method of authentication,&rdquo; he said.Limo continued, &ldquo;Kenyans were able to confirm the accuracy of their details in the voters&rsquo; register and make corrections.&rdquo;Limo said the process was in line with the IEBC timelines to take place for at least one month and three months to the polls. He said the verification using the new KIEMS provided a tremendous opportunity to test the technology to use on Election Day.&ldquo;We only received the &lsquo;check in&rsquo; gadgets on the eve of the polls in 2013. We deployed 10,000 gadgets and they have worked very well,&rdquo; Limo said.He continued, &ldquo;There has also been a call for activation of SMS-based and online query systems. Both have been developed and will be rolled out soon in the next phase of public access to the register.&rdquo;
