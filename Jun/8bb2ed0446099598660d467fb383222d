The Sh327 billion standard gauge railway is not worth the money, says Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho, promising to show how SGR will hurt the economy.He spoke on Thursday at his office, saying Jubilee&rsquo;s flagship project will be his focus when he returns from his pilgrimage to Mecca.He left for Mecca on Friday.Joho said he will resume campaigning on July 1, with a &ldquo;major press conference&rdquo; to be attended by all those who have been affected by the SGRThey include transporters, container freight stations, warehouse operators and port users.The first phase of the SGR from Mombasa to Nairobi cost about Sh327 billion, while it is estimated the second phase from Nairobi to Malaba will cost Sh507 billion.Joho suspended his national and county campaigns when Ramadhan, the Muslim fasting month, began.The governor said he will show that the SGR will hurt the economy and Kenyans are not getting value for money.&ldquo;Sh700 ticket price for economy class is political. So is Sh50,000 to transport a single container,&rdquo; he said.Jubilee plans to increase charges after September, Joho said. &ldquo;If NASA wins, the entire deal and engagement will be reviewed,&rdquo; he added.Joho said it should not have been funded by a commercial loan.SGR is a bad idea as it has been established to aid transportation of imports, not exports, he said. &ldquo;How is this economy going to grow if it will be importing more than exporting?&rdquo; he said.
