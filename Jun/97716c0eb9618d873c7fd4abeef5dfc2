ODM National Treasurer Timothy Bosire has accused Jubilee of stoking tribal tensions and blackmailing some communities to vote for President Uhuru Kenyatta in the August 8 polls.The Kitutu Masaba MP said the President and the Jubilee brigade have been misinterpreting opposition presidential candidate Raila&rsquo;s Odinga's statements to advance a divisive political agenda."Jubilee wants to trigger chaos by misinterpreting Raila&rsquo;s statements. They are trying to stoke anxiety and prepare the ground for chaos...they are thirsty for chaos but Kenyans are thirsty for peace.""Kenyans will not allow them (Jubilee) to use chaos and fear to ascend to power like what they did in 2013," the lawmaker said on Sunday.Bosire said Raila&rsquo;s statements touching on land in Kajiado last week have been deliberately taken out of context by Jubilee.He said they suspect the intention of the claims is to advance a narrative of blackmailing Kenyans to reelect Uhuru."Raila owns properties all over Kenya. It is Jubilee who have created a situation where vulnerable Kenyans are forced to sell the little they have for survival," Bosire said.Raila was quoted last week telling the Maasai community not to sell their land to 'outsiders' trying to occupy their ancestral territory.The remarks sparked fury from Jubilee leaders who called upon the National Cohesion and Integration Commission and the Directorate of Public Prosecutions to probe the ODM leader for incitement.More on this: Probe Raila over 'hate' remarks, Jubilee asks NCICThe Directorate of Criminal Investigations, NCIC, and the DPP is said to have opened investigations into the alleged inflammatory remarks.Read: Is Raila under probe for incitement?However, Bosire said the opposition chief&rsquo;s statements do not amount to incitement or hate speech.He said they were meant to enlighten the Maasai community against impoverishment by occasioned by selling their land."Raila was trying to explain how the community has been impoverished and being forced to sell their land at throwaway prices to eke a living.""He told the community that it is Jubilee that is responsible for their impoverishment," Bosire said.
