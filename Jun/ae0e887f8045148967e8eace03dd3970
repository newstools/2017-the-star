NASA presidential flagbearer Raila Odinga has accused the Jubilee government of mismanaging the agricultural sector.He said nothing meaningful has been done by the government to improve food production.Raila, who led the NASA team in Trans Nzoia on a campaign trail, accused Deputy President William Ruto of being behind the supply of the alleged poor quality fertiliser and other farm inputs which have hurt the country&rsquo;s efforts to become food secure.He said if elected, the NASA government would ensure no state official conducts business with the government.&ldquo;All five principals have agreed that we will not allow government officers to do business with the government. We want to allow other Kenyans to also benefit from tenders and other business opportunities,&rdquo; Raila said.He slammed the Jubilee government for ignoring experts&rsquo; warning on the maize shortage, saying the hunger being experienced in the country should be blamed entirely on the government because &ldquo;it failed to tackle the issue when the matter was raised&rdquo;.Raila alleged that the Jubilee government imported maize unfit for human consumption instead of empowering farmers to produce enough maize for Kenyans.He said during the grand coalition administration, the government bought maize from farmers at Sh3,200. Raila said the current administration reduced the price to Sh2,200, and discouraged maize farming.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s unfortunate the government is now buying maize from Mexico farmers at Sh4,600 when the same government refused to buy maize from farmers at a favourable price,&rdquo; he said.Raila said the economy has been grounded by the government and this has raised the cost of living. He said Kenyans can no longer afford to buy basic commodities like unga and milk.Raila said the Jubilee government has failed to honour its campaign pledges to the people of Trans Nzoia county.He said a number of development projects promised to the residents have not been initiated. Raila said the Trans Nzoia people have no reason to reelect the Jubilee government.&ldquo;We have Barbaton to Enebess and Kitale to Kolongolo roads that the government claimed will be tarmacked, but up to date, nothing has been done and that is the reason we want you people of Trans Nzoia to send this regime home,&rdquo; he said.Raila said all road projects being undertaken in the county are initiatives of the grand coalition government.He said the government has neglected IDPs in the country, adding that only a few have been resettled.Raila said the NASA government will give first priority to the issue if it wins by ensuring that IDPs are resettled.On the issue of crude oil, the NASA flagbearer said it is &ldquo;laughable&rdquo; that the government plans to transport it by road. Raila said the NASA government would ensure a pipeline is constructed to ensure Kenyans benefit from the discovered oil. &ldquo;I am surprised the government plans to transport the crude oil by road,&rdquo; he said.
