When the author breaks up with the girl next door, with whom he embarked on an epic adventure to Central America &mdash; as detailed in his book The Full Montezuma &mdash; he dives into a mad trip across Africa this time, from Cape Town to Cairo, by any means possible. Why Africa? One might wonder. Let&rsquo;s just say that as is the case with adventurous foreign millennials and generations before them (this book was actually published in 2002), this continent struck him as the perfect place to find himself in the face of his personal anguish. Beware, however, that contrary to what the book title might have you believe, there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any heartbreak- the author seems to have gotten over that one pretty fast.This is the perfect book for anyone keen on backpacking across Africa on a very tight budget, especially if you are a bit of a daredevil, since the author has a penchant for taking the advised-against route, sometimes staying in some pretty questionable places. He zig-zags through expansive game parks, awe-inspiring pyramids, overpopulated cities and much more, but this book is more about his often hair-raising misadventures and the animated characters he encounters rather than &lsquo;the beauty of the continent'.Expect hilarious accounts of exhausting rides in rickety listing vehicles packed with chicken, being thrown out of Robert Mugabe&rsquo;s birthday party in Zimbabwe &mdash; at gun point no less &mdash; encountering a wild hyena seemingly suffering from halitosis, hiding in a coffin shop to avoid getting swept up in a riot, and evading over 20,000 single women intent on attracting the King of Swaziland during an annual Reed Dance.&ldquo;In retrospect, that wasn&rsquo;t exactly the best idea&rdquo; and &ldquo;I probably shouldn&rsquo;t have done that&rdquo; are recurring phrases in this book. You will laugh your head off in some chapters, but secretly, you&rsquo;ll be glad it was Peter Moore and not you.
