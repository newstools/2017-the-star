Mwendwa spoke after touring the facility, where he led a delegation of CAF officials to inspect the progress of the ongoing upgrade at the stadium.&ldquo;We have checked the work done by the county government of Meru and we are happy with the progress since the stadium is one of the facilities that will host Africa Nations Championship. The County Government is expected to finalise on Phase One by July 15. The phase includes building of fans stands and fencing the ground. Phase Two will be done by the national government through Sports Kenya and Local Organizing Committee of Chan,&rdquo; added Mwendwa.He applauded the works at Kinoru, saying the progress was much better as compared to Eldoret&rsquo;s Kipchoge Keino Stadium. He said the stadium will host two rounds of matches this weekend and next weekend before being closed for Phase Two upgrade.&ldquo;After that, Kinoru will not host any more matches. We will close it for five months until November since we need to uproot all the grass and plant new grass,&rdquo; Mwendwa said. He said the stadium will host group D of the Chan Cup.
