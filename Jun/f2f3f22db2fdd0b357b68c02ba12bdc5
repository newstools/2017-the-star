This year’s election will be won on voter turnout. The
eventual results will be determined by who was the better mobilizer. It will all
depend on the strategy that Jubilee has put in place for their supporters to
come out and vote and the strategy that NASA has put in place for their people
to come out and vote. And
for Jubilee, you can see their rallying call is what they term as their
achievements. Whether their so- called achievements such as the standard gauge
railway, despite its inflated cost, have had an impact on Kenyans to an extent
that they will feel compelled to come out in large numbers, is something we are
waiting to see. But it’s their messaging to the electorate that will motivate
their people to come out and vote. They
are trying to reawaken the ICC ghost, a strong rallying call in 2013. From
where I sit, the ICC is a dead issue. It can no longer excite. For
NASA, their most potent arsenal is the cost of living. They will have to
sustain the narrative of how Jubilee has flatly failed, despite the skyrocketting
food prices. You have seen that even as the President moves around, Kenyans
openly confront him on the issue of unga. He was asked for unga in Budalang’i
and again in Kakamega. This is good political fodder for NASA. Then there are
the issues of unfulfilled promises, the laptops, stadiums, etc. But
it’s a fact that Raila has made inroads in some erstwhile Jubilee turf: Meru,
Bomet, West Pokot and Nakuru, for instance. In
the Kalenjin Rift Valley, just a few weeks ago, NASA registered a lot of
defections from former and sitting Jubilee MPs – the likes of Peris Simam and
David Koech. In politics, defections don't just happen. It’s either he is
gaining a foothold or becoming popular in that region. Then
there is the Maasai community, also in the Rift Valley. In 2013, Narok and
Kajiado almost voted evenly for Raila and Uhuru. Today, the support traction
that NASA has gained in the two counties is so massive that they are no longer
a swing vote: It’s Raila turf. Uhuru
and team have spent a lot of time campaigning in Western Kenya and Coast. In
the former Western province, they have registered some defections from NASA. Politics
sometimes is won entirely on perception. Ambasa is a political
