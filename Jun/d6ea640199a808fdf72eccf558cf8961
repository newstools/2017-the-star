Wiper’s Garissa Township  MP candidate Farah Maalim yesterday expressed confidence that he will win on  August 8. He will face Majority Leader Aden Duale and ANC deputy party leader Abdi Yarre in what has been described as a battle of titans. Speaking to the press shortly after being cleared to run by IEBC returning officer, Maalim said he is not worried by criticism coming from his rivals. “In my campaigns, I only talk about issues, areas and sectors that need to be changed,” he said. “I’m not the kind of politician who responds to statements. All I can say is ‘Bring it on!’ Let the people of Garissa decide. They will vote for positive change.” Maalim said  no efforts by any politician will divide residents. Maalim urged them to rise above clan politics. He was accompanied by former rivals Nasir Dolal and Abdi Majid, and his supporters. The two are from the same clan but stepped down in his favour. “People have matured. The shenanigans spun by politicians to revalidate themselves after failing to deliver are no longer  going to work in this part of the country,” Maalim said. Duale is to be cleared by the IEBC today. He has warned his rivals to prepare for a resounding defeat. Duale has on several occasions dismissed Maalim’s candidacy and described him as a village politician who was rejected by his people in Dadaab. “I want to tell him for free that he has no votes in this constituency. I will send him ino early retirement,” he said last month. “Nobody will ever hear about him again.” The incumbent is from the Abduwak clan, while Farah comes is from the Aulihan. The two are the predominant clans in the constituency and how they vote significantly influences the outcome of elections.
