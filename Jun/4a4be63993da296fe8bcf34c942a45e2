A seven-year-old pupil stunned his teachers by writing "Jubilee 2017" as his name in a Mathematics exam paper.Roy Kiplangat from Kecheyat Academy in Nakuru wrote "Jubilee 2017" after his name, then "DP Ruto" in the slot allocated for the date.He scored 100 per cent in the examination.When asked, the top-performing student said he would like to be like Deputy President William Ruto when he grows up.His class teacher Agnes Koech said Kiplangat ranked second in the previous exam."This boy is extraordinary in everything. He is confident, talkative and bright in class work," she told journalists on Thursday.Kiplangat's father Richard Tole said his son is obedient and calm."I have learnt from his teachers that he is a good singer and story teller in school, but he talks less at home," Tole, a shopkeeper, said.Tole said Kiplangat always complains when he fails to see the DP in the news."He is always happy when he sees Ruto talk on the television."Head teacher Ann Cheruyiot said the DP visited the school in April and left Sh50,000 for pupils who stopped and entertained him at the gate."I can attest that the boy is unique in everything he does," she added.When the Star sought to know more about him, Kiplangat came forward for a dance as other students sang and clapped for him.
