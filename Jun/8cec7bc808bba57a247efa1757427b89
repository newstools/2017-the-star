The High Court yesterday directed that a case seeking to stop Murang'a Governor Mwangi Wairia's reelection be heard in Murang'a.Voter Jackson Ndegwa last week sued to stop Wairia over what he says are unresolved corruption allegations against him.Justice John Mativo said the court cannot go against its rules. The rule stipulates that every case shall be instituted within the local limits of the jurisdiction where the violations took place provided there is a High Court.Addressing the court yesterday, Ndegwa said he filed the case in Nairobi because he lives in the city and all the respondents, including the governor, have offices in the city.In his petition, Ndegwa has asked the court to direct the DPP to investigate ad institute criminal proceedings against Wairia for alleged corruption and abuse of office.He further wants the EACC to furnish the court with progress, status of investigations and recommendations on the governor&rsquo;s integrity.Ndegwa says the governor does not meet the constitutional threshold on leadership and integrity under Chapter 6 and faces unresolved claims touching on his integrity.He is seeking an order restraining Wairia from contesting and a declaration that it would be unconstitutional for any state organ to clear him.Ndegwa argued that the governor violated Chapter 6 of the Constitution, which does not have geographical boundaries, hence the reason he filed the case in Nairobi.But Mativo said the petition should have been filed in Murang'a and not Nairobi, according to the High Court rules.He directed the deputy register to ensure that the file is transferred to Murang'a and placed before the duty Judge for mention on June 16.
