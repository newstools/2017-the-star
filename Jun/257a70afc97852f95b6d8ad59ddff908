The government has told off the opposition for allegedly spreading propaganda that the SGR project was overpriced by Sh100 billion. During the weekly press briefing, State House Spokesperson Manoah Esipisu said the project was completed within the set timelines and budget. "Today, more than 1,300 people were booked on the service to Mombasa from Nairobi, an oversubscription and a clear signal that the service is an important cog in Kenya’s infrastructure development," he stated. He stated that the launch of both Freight Service and the passenger service “Madaraka Express” by President Uhuru Kenyatta was an opportunity for all Kenyans through job creation and travel. "It is common knowledge that propagandists and purveyors of empty rhetoric, not believing that the train would be delivered on time and on the budget, have now focused their noises on the notion that the SGR was somehow overpriced," Esipisu added. He challenged anyone really interested in the story to get details from the Transport Ministry and Kenya Railways. He further said the President will seek re-election on his fulfilled promises. Last week Mombasa governor Hassan Joho was barred on from attending President Uhuru's SGR launch in Miritini.

He accused the President of "oiling the wheels of corruption at the expense of service delivery". During the launch, Uhuru asked the Governor to concentrate on justifying his re-election to residents.
