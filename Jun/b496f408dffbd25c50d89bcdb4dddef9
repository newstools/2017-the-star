NASA affiliate party candidates for the Bungoma Senate seat have rejected ODM leader Raila Odinga&rsquo;s proposal that they step down for incumbent and Ford Kenya chief Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula.On Saturday, ODM candidate Bonny Nyongesa and ANC&rsquo;s David Makali dismissed Raila&rsquo;s endorsement of Wetang&rsquo;ula.Nyongesa said it was wrong for their party leader to endorse a candidate from an affiliate party, yet ODM has a nominee.His sentiments were echoed by branch chairman Ali Majani, who said ODM is not willing to sacrifice its candidate.He said Wetang&rsquo;ula should let other contestants seek votes, instead of seeking endorsements. &ldquo;Our candidate will be on the ballot and Ford Kenya should realise every candidate has a democratic right to contest for the seat,&rdquo; Majani said.He said as a NASA co-principal, Wetang&rsquo;ula is guaranteed a Cabinet post if the alliance wins, so &ldquo;he should not come down to the Senate seat.&rdquo;Majani said there is an agreement among co-principals to share seats and that Wetang&rsquo;ula&rsquo;s Senate bid is a sign he is not confident NASA will win.&ldquo;He is trying to look for a fallback and such negativity is not needed,&rdquo; he said.
