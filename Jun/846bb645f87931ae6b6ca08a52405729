The endorsement complicates the Jubilee equation of former Interior CS Joseph Lenku's bid to unseat Nkedianye.Kores fell out with Jubilee, along with Senator Peter Mositet, after the two claimed they were rigged out during the April primaries.The new development will keep Jubilee heads spinning for a while, given an earlier assumption that Kajiado could be Jubilee&rsquo;s granary for swing votes in August.Kores and Mositet called a press conference in Kiserian and claimed DP William Ruto tampered with the party nominations. Speaking in Iloodokilani, Kajiado West on Sunday evening, Kores said he has no business left in Jubilee and is now drumming support for Nkedianye and NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga.He also said he will campaign for ODM senator nominee Daniel Tenaai to revenge to what DP Ruto &ldquo;did to us&rdquo;."I thank all Iloodokilani people for the votes you gave me during the failed Jubilee Party nominations. We really wanted the seat as Iloodokilani people, but the Deputy President and the Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery joined hands to ensure I don't get the ticket," Kores said.He claimed he won the nomination, but those opposed to him and Mositet ensured they were rigged out."I won with more than 18,000 votes and Mositet also won with more than 40,000 votes," Kores said.
