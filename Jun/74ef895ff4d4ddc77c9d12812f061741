Kenya for Justice and Development Trust is demanding full disclosure from the government about the Amu Power Company dealings. The organisation said there is no current demand for the power that will be produced by Lamu Coal Power to justify the hefty investment of about Sh200 bilion. The lobby is apprehensive that the government made concessions against the public interest, including Kenya Power, which will be forced to purchase power it does not need or face punitive sanctions. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s suspected t the government has undermined the public interest by entering into concessions to restrict its investments in power generation to accommodate the Lamu coal-fired power plant,&rdquo; Okiya Omtatah said in a letter. The Kejude executive director addressed the letter to Attorney General Githu Muigai, National Treasury PS Kamau Thugge and his Energy counterpart Andrew Kamau. The June 8 letter threatened legal action over nondisclosure.
