Tension between Kenya and Uganda over Lake Victoria is fuelled largely by lack of official international boundaries and contradictory national laws.That&rsquo;s what emerged on Wednesday in a meeting in Bondo aimed at quelling constant conflict and tension involving fishermen and marine officers from both countries.Kenyan MP Gideon Ochanda (Bondo) and Ugandan MP George Abbot (Bukooli) said it&rsquo;s necessary to harmonise laws and establish a common framework to manage the lake.They promised to try to end bad blood through diplomacy. Five Kenyans are being held in Uganda&rsquo;s Namaingo Prison.It was revealed that in three months one Ugandan police officer solicited Ush18 million (Sh600,000) bribes from Kenyan fishermen.It was also reported many Ugandan marine officers have turned into pirates, moving to Kenyan shores.
