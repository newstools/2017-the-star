"Counties have done their bit. We have already increased their allowances and salaries. It is only the signing of the CBA they are after. Please, nurses, return to work and give SRC more time for implementation," he said.He spoke at Kanthiari Dispensary in Igembe South where he presented a cheque of Sh500,000 for completing the construction of a maternity wing.Munya also said the health workers should allow the SRC to take other government workers' demands into account.&ldquo;It is an agreement that will take many years. Give the SRC and government time to explore the salary structures of workers including clinical officers so no group gets more money than others,and to protect the taxpayer."The SRC said implementing the Sh40 billion agreement is unrealistic as figures quoted were exaggerated. The commission also termed a uniform allowance of Sh40,000 for each of the 25,000 union health workers unsustainable.The Council of Governors, through chair Josephat Nanok (Turkana) has also disowned the CBA saying the pay demand is illegal.The council further said nurses downed their tools while negotiations for the deal were at an advanced stage.Several patients have died since the strike began while others are being transferred to private facilities.Government spokesman Erick Kiraithe said the nurses&rsquo; union leaders could be taking orders from some opposition politicians.
