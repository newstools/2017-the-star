He is such an experienced driver and will definitely be the man to beat,&rdquo; said Jaspreet Chatthe who has been the closest of all the locals in the battle against the Flying Finn.Chatthe, a former African champion and multiple Safari winner, has a lot of catch up work to do following an error in Safari which dipped him further below the KNRC log.Tapio has won two out of three rallies held thus far and will be going for a hattrick of wins at halfway stage.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure that the focus will be on Tapio. Whenever he has had a good run he has swept the ground with all his opponents but we don&rsquo;t really know how much he can go,&rdquo; said Chager.Tundo has had a good season scoring podiums in the last three rallies. Duncan has finished second twice in the season and Chatthe hoping to make up for his Safari error.The event will witnessed quite a good number of super cars.
