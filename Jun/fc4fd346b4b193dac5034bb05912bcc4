Adelle Onyango has set in motion an aggressive youth movement to empower young minds by providing them with opportunities to make a difference in the workforce.&ldquo;Because I'm passionate about my fellow young people! We are so misunderstood and I want to create a space where young people celebrate their individuality instead of having it labelled as wrong. And also to give wholesome access to industry stakeholders who can really teach those of us at the beginning stages of our journey a thing or two. I want to build unity amongst young people," Adelle said.She added that it will "solidify the team and build a movement of self-aware young Kenyans" able to bring change in the country. "After campus I did not have a similar opportunity to grow myself. That is why I think it's important for these opportunities to be there. The programme will be in bi-yearly calendars with different activities and talks,&rdquo; Adelle said. The movement, named #TeamAdelle, offers the youth "access to mentorship talks from skilled individuals in creative industries, apprenticeship - a chance to spend a day with these individuals, internships, a chance to be part of our charity events and hangouts!"A while back, Adelle denied that she bought designer shoes, Human Race by Pharell Williams, for Sh80,000. Asked what she would like to tell Pharell if they ever met, Adelle said: "I'd ask him to collaborate with me in opening a creative hub for East Africans. I'd like to co-partner with him on that and just have a space for creatives to learn more about their different skills, earn from them and grow them, too. If I can't do that alone, then I'd definitely do it with Pharell!"
