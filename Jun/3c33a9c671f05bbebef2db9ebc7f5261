Opposition Chief Raila Odinga has warned the government against deploying KDF to man the forthcoming August general elections.Speaking in Vihiga on Saturday, Raila said the move is the latest plot by Jubilee to rig the election after Court of Appeal maintained a ruling favoring the opposition that presidential results be announced at the constituency level.He said deploying military on any assignment without the approval of the parliament was a violation of the constitution."It is not the responsibility of Kenya Defense Forces to get involved in issues of internal security. Army is set in place to guard the country against external forces. If the government wants to use military in the coming elections they must get an approval from the parliament," Raila said.He said, "I want to warn the CS for Defense my sister Raychelle Omamo please trade carefully. Don't be tricked in somethings that do not apply. Let Military remain non partisan when it comes to elections as their General said".Raiila maintained that they have credible information that the government was using NIS and other security agents amid efforts to rig the elections."They have convened a meeting for all regional coordinators and some other security agents, they want to strategically position them to steal the elections but this round we shall not allow we are very alert," he said.He maintained that the coalition will have 5 agents in every polling station to monitor the process.Raila reiterated that Jubilee regime is to blame for the current high cost of living.According to him, Jubilee's poor leadership had seen many investors shift their businesses to other countries which has rendered many youth jobless.We have traversed many parts and everyone is crying of high cost of unga, sugar, and fare among others. When we ascend to power we shall ensure we reduce the cost of living in the first 100 days, he said.
