Trans Nzoia Governor Patrick Khaemba has said it is not unfair for the KMTC Kitale branch, sponsored by his government, to only enrol three students from the county during each intake. He faulted the national government for allocating a few places for students from the county, yet &ldquo;many of Trans Nzoia&rsquo;s resources are used by the institution&rdquo;.Speaking in Kitale yesterday, Khaemba said the county referral hospital being constructed by his government will have a training facility that will give priority to students from Trans Nzoia.He said 70 per cent of the students who will be admitted at the hospital will come from Trans Nzoia.&ldquo;The national government is doing badly because after we used a lot of resources as a county, they have denied our students training chances,&rdquo; Khaemba said.The Trans Nzoia government is putting up the facility at a cost of Sh1 billion.Khaemba said his government will soon sign an MoU with an insurance company to pay for the elderly to be treated at government facilities.President Uhuru Kenyatta held a meeting with Jubilee Party aspirants from Trans Nzoia last Sunday as he searches for votes. Uhuru urged them to rally their supporters to turn up in large numbers to vote.
