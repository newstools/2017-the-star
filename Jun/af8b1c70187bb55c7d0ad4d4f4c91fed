Nyatike MP Edick Anyanga has said he will move to court to challenge trade union leader Tom Odege&rsquo;s win during the repeat ODM nomination last Friday.Anyanga said the exercise was stage-managed with returning officer Mark Orem given instructions from above to ignore irregularities.Speaking to the Star on the phone yesterday, he said while the Court of Appeal gave directions for universal suffrage to be used in nominations, only 35 polling centers were used out of more than 100 in the constituency.&ldquo;The exercise was ordered by the court, which was to deliberate on the outcome before making a final decision. I will move to challenge the decision which was marred by irregularities,&rdquo; Anyanga said.He claimed the results were &ldquo;cooked&rdquo; in Migori town by party officials from Nairobi. He said Orem refused to act on complaints raised.Orem said he did not know any candidate personally.
