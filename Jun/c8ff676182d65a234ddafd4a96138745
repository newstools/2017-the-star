Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero and his Deputy Jonathan Mueke have promised to bring together all leaders from NASA affiliate parties to avert possible fallouts.The governor and Mueke on Friday met 400 Nairobi Wiper leaders, where they promised to ensure all NASA affiliate parties are fully involved in the campaign.Kidero called for unity and warned against any attempts by either party to undermine the rest. He said the coalition risks losing seats to Jubilee if rifts among NASA parties are allowed to dominate their campaign agenda.&ldquo;We have worked together with a great sense of respect for the last four years and we cannot risk making a mistake at this hour of need,&rdquo; Kidero said. The governor was taken to task by the Wiper leaders to ensure the party, together with Ford Kenya and ANC, are accorded respect by leaders from ODM. They complained that the governor&rsquo;s political rallies have been turned into an ODM affair, to the dismay of aspirants from other parties. Mueke said they could be forced to seek help from ODM leader Raila Odinga.
