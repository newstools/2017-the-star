It is only until I visited the family on Sunday that I knew he succumbed to a serious beating by rowdy youth" said Chemjor.He said as the government, "we condemn the mob justice purported to be disciplining the man and assure that action shall be taken to ensure all the criminals are brought to book" he said.
