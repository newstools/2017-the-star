Kisumu voters will have to choose between mediocrity and impunity in the governor race, a former governor contender has said.Businessman Hezron Mc&rsquo;Obewa, who lost in the ODM nominations, yesterday said incumbent governor Jack Ranguma is the hallmark of mediocrity, while ODM candidate Anyang&rsquo; Nyong&rsquo;o represents impunity.He spoke during a morning talk show on a local radio station. Mc&rsquo;Obewa said residents must choose between the two.He said Ranguma has handled about Sh30 billion, yet residents are still crying foul and Nyong&rsquo;o also controlled hundreds of billions when he was Medical Services minister, but has nothing to show for it on the ground.Mc&rsquo;Obewa, however, seems comfortable with mediocrity after he said he will vote for Ranguma &ldquo;for having reached out to me around eight times for my vote&rdquo;.
