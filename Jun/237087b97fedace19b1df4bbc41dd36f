Mavoko ODM parliamentary candidate Michael Mutuku has laughed off claims by MP Patrick Makau that he has been endorsed by NASA top leadership to defend his seat.Mutuku said the Wiper legislator has lost grip of Mavoko votes and is seeking political sympathy from NASA presidential candidate and ODM party leader Raila Odinga.&ldquo;How on earth can a leader of a political party support the candidature of an opponent while his own party has a candidate for the same position?&rdquo; he said.Mutuku addressed a public rally at Slota slum, Athi River town, on Tuesday.Mutuku said most of the projects in the constituency were done by the former Kathiani MP Wavinya Ndeti.&ldquo;We wonder where Mavoko CDF goes, there are no tangible projects implemented by the fund since 2013,&rdquo; he said.Mutuku said the residents were confused since Makau tells them that all projects had been devolved, &ldquo;we wonder the role of CDF. Makau has evaded responsibility, he says everything is devolved,&rdquo; said Mutuku.But Makau dismissed the claims of misuse of CDF.He said he only oversees implementation of the fund as a patron, &ldquo;How is it possible for someone to steal from the fund when there are many actors and signatories involved, including government officials? Hiyo ni fitina, na haita wapeleka mahali,&rdquo; said Makau.
