Two Kadu Asili politicians have told the Jubilee and NASA presidential candidates to stop imposing their preferred Kilifi governor hopefuls on residents.Governor candidate Kazungu Kambi and Lucas Maitha for senator said residents will vote for whoever they feel will make a better governor.They said ODM&rsquo;s Amason Kingi and Jubilee&rsquo;s Gideon Mung&rsquo;aro are puppets of NASA flabearer Raila Odinga and Jubilee&rsquo;s President Uhuru Kenyatta. Wiper&rsquo;s Gabriel Katana dropped out of the governor race after the IEBC failed to clear him because his name appears in two party registers.&ldquo;There will be no six-piece voting in Kilifi. If you want votes, come and talk to us and then go away,&rdquo; Maitha said at Matano Manne , Ganze constituency, on Saturday. &ldquo;The Mijikenda people are not &lsquo;yessir&rsquo; people,&rdquo; Kambi said.
