Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga got a reprieve after the High Court reversed a decision by the Political Parties Tribunal cancelling his nomination.High Court judge Justice Enoch Chacha Mwita last Friday evening set aside the judgment of the tribunal which had barred ODM from presenting Rasanga&rsquo;s name as its candidate for Siaya county to the IEBC. The judge said the tribunal reached its verdict without tangible evidence. The judgment arose out of an application filed by Rasanga to challenge the cancellation of his nomination. The tribunal, chaired by Kyalo Mbobu, on June 2 cancelled the nomination certificate issued to Rasanga by the returning officer for the ODM primaries held in April, saying the exercise had been marred by electoral malpractices. However, Mwita held that the tribunal erred in law when it failed to find out whether two petitioners - Jeckonia Okungu and Julius Okayo - were registered members of ODM.According to the judge, the tribunal should have asked the two to bring the full list of members of ODM from party headquarters to prove they were bona fide members who have rights to file a complaint against Rasanga.
