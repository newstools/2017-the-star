President Uhuru Kenyatta will begin a campaign tour of Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka&rsquo;s Kitui county tomorrow to hunt for votes.He has a tight and hectic schedule that will see him address an average of seven campaign meetings, according to the tentative itinerary. The President is scheduled to launch key projects and hopes to reap big from the apparent political fallouts in Wiper. Already, a number of former Wiper MPs are seeking reelection on the JP ticket. Mwingi Central MP Joe Mutambu said the finer details of Uhuru&rsquo;s programme are still being discussed, but he kicks off the campaign tour on Friday with the launch of the Kiambere&ndash;Mwingi water project in Kyuso.He will then commission the construction of the Nguni&ndash;Nuu road and address a rally in Mwingi town before flying to launch the Inyuu Bridge in Kitui East constituency.&ldquo;The President will address another rally in Kitui town before going to inspect the construction of the Kitui&ndash;Kibwezi road in Kitui South. The last of his activities is to launch a new road at South Eastern Kenya University,&rdquo; Mutambu said.Uhuru is also expected in Makueni county today.Recently, Kitui West MP Francis Nyenze (Wiper) appeared to lean towards Jubilee when he publicly endorsed Uhuru&rsquo;s reelection.Nyenze has since said he was just impressed by the Jubilee administration under Uhuru for giving jobs to youths in his constituency.
