About 20 employees are jobless.&ldquo;We are not aware what the cause is, but police are investigating,&rdquo; Wamukota said, as MP Chris Wamalwa called for swift investigation.Elsewhere in Kitale, Sh3.4 million property was destroyed after a timber yard next to a petrol station at Posta Grounds was burnt.A lit cigarette caused the fire. It was thrown at the back of the yard.Property owner Jacob Mwashi said the fires was only extinguished after many items had been destroyed.He said he was informed of the fire by a passerby.Mwashi said the structures were semi-permanent, causing the fire to spread fast. &ldquo;We were in the process of insuring the business as it was still semi-permanent,&rdquo; he said, adding that he plans to refurbish the yard.Infrastructure CEC member Wycliffe Kiiya, who visited the scene, said the county fire brigade acted swiftly after being informed.The team collaborated with Khetia&rsquo;s Gigamart&rsquo;s firefighters though it had consumed most of the items. The county has over 20 firefighters and two fire engines.
