President Uhuru Kenyatta focused on maintaining his grip on the Kalenjin community votes, amid growing splits and threats of disunity that could deny him the support he needs to faceoff with the Opposition in August.He and DP William Ruto consider the region a Jubilee stronghold, but insiders in the party told the Star they are concerned that Kanu, Chama Cha Mashinani and independent candidates may cause splits within the community.Uhuru, who camped in the North Rift from Thursday met with Jubilee candidates at private meetings, where he asked them to ensure they do not give a chance to opponents to infiltrate the region and deny Jubilee crucial votes.&ldquo;Our focus during Uhuru&rsquo;s visit has been unity, which is key to the success of the party and we agreed that we will work as a team to ensure we achieve the six-piece voting pattern in the region,&rdquo; Rift Valley candidates&rsquo; spokesman and Nandi Senator Stephen Sang said. He is running for Nandi governor on the JP ticket.Sang is emerging to be a close ally of the President and the DP and he denies there are opponents undermining Jubilee in the region.The President visited Trans Nzoia, Uasin Gishu, Nandi and Elgeyo Marakwet counties.&ldquo;We have done what previous governments did not achieve since Independence. We want to continue this journey so that we can take this country to the next level of development,&rdquo; Uhuru said in Chepkorio, Keiyo South.During the trip, there was focus on Ruto as most Jubilee candidates expected him to declare support for them.Ruto yielded to pressure from a camp of politicians led by Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago, who had threatened to back NASA if the DP failed to meet their demands.&ldquo;Please do not embarrass me in this region. Vote for Uhuru and Jubilee in August,&rdquo; Ruto said in Kapseret, where he had been hosted by MP Oscar Sudi.On Saturday, Ruto said that Mandago won the primaries in Uasin Gishu and deserves to be supported by all those who lost, including Bundotich Kiprop, alias Buzeki.Mandago, led by Oscar Sudi (Kapseret) and Alfred Keter (Nandi Hills), had demanded that Uhuru and Ruto publicly back the governor and ask Buzeki to step down.Mandago and the two MPs threatened to urge the Kalenjin community in Uasin Gishu to support the Opposition to protest against Buzeki&rsquo;s bid. The rivalry between Buzeki and Mandago has sparked heated politics in Uasin Gishu, Eldoret town in particular, where Buzeki enjoys massive support. Rifts between the Kalenjin and Kikuyu communities in Eldoret over the position of governor are also a major concern for Uhuru and Ruto to tackle, but analysts say they appear to have widened as a meeting of elders and leaders failed to materialise.&ldquo;By declaring support for Mandago, Ruto achieved a lot than if he would have gone without talking about it. He may not have pleased everyone, but he needed the crucial backing of the Kalenjins,&rdquo; Mandago&rsquo;s campaigner Joseph Chumba said.Uhuru was also forced to change tack during his campaigns in the North Rift, where he largely dwelt on asking for his own votes after deep divisions played out between Jubilee candidates and the independents.Elgeyo Marakwet Governor Alex Tolgos was forced to cut short his speech in Chepkorio after people shouted in support of independent candidate Moses Changwony.Uhuru, who was present, watched helplessly as Tolgos was forced to invite Changwony to address the meeting. &ldquo;We can assure you that your votes as the President are safe, but for other seats, we request that you let us sort it out on the ground,&rdquo; Changwony said.The President and Ruto did not comment on the incident.The two will be in Eldoret today and Elgeyo Marakwet tomorrow.
