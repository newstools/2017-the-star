DEMOCRACY is about far more than elections. However, the holding of transparent, accountable and credible elections is an important cornerstone of the democratic process in any country, and domestic election observers can make a significant contribution in this process.According to the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (International IDEA), election observation is the purposeful gathering of information regarding an electoral process and the making of informed judgments about the process on the basis of the information collected. In addition to providing credible information on the electoral process, the presence of election observers builds voter confidence in the integrity of the process as well as the integrity of the electoral management body.Non-partisan election observation also helps to deter or expose violence or intimidation, as well as cheating or manipulation of the vote or election results.Observing elections can be divided into three phases: Observing what occurs before, during and after an election.The pre-election period includes all activities that occur before the actual day of voting. The Election Day observation covers all activities that occur on the day of actual voting.The post-election period includes all activities that occur ex post facto (for instance, the adjudication of disputes over election results, petitions and the formation of the government).Objectives of election observation include helping to avoid fraud and exposing fraud where it occurs; helping identify human errors in the electoral process; promoting citizen confidence in the electoral process; verifying the results of elections and referenda, to provide systematic information about whether elections are conducted according to established rules and regulations and to provide recommendations to improve future elections.The principles of election observation are impartiality; non-interference and non-obstruction; factual, verifiable information; respect for the laws of the land; unimpeded access to all phases of the process, all stakeholders and territory; protection by the authorities and freedom to issue a public opinion on the process.It is important to have sources of information that can help one compare to ensure that the data gathered is credible. International observers in particular come in with an international eye because they have not been part of the politics. They are able to access information more objectively than local observers and come on board with international best practices.We push for accurate data in the report that should be shared very widely, depending on the focus of observers.
