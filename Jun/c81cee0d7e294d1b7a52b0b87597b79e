Some farmers in the Rift Valley have praised Jubilee&rsquo;s plan to further reduce the price of subsidised fertiliser to Sh1,200 per bag from Sh1,800 by December. President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto launched the Jubilee Party&rsquo;s manifesto on Monday.The farmers said Jubilee had already implemented some of its agenda for the agriculture sector in its 2013 manifesto, which will boost crop and dairy farming, citing the reduction of fertiliser prices from more than Sh4,000 to Sh 1,800 per bag.&ldquo;We just hope that they will do more so that farmers can make profits from farming and produce more food so that we do not have food shortages as we have experienced this year,&rdquo; said chairman of the Kenya National Farmers Union Musa Barno.He said the setting up of milk coolers in the region, the revival of the New KCC factory in Eldoret, and the payment of more than Sh500 million owed to farmers had given them impetus to work harder.Ruto on Monday said the government will invest more in irrigation schemes, like it is doing for the Galana-Kulalu project. But Kipkorir Menjo, a farmer, and a director at the Kenya Farmers&rsquo; Association, said Jubilee should focus more on research to reduce crop diseases and pest invasion.
