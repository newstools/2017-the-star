Tanzania&rsquo;s most loved band, Yamoto Band, has split, reports say.Dogo Aslay, real name Siaka Nasor, has been blamed by his fellow band members for the split.During a recent radio interview in a Tanzanian local radio station, band member Bakar Abdul, alias Beka, admitted that they have been forced to release singles because Aslay departed.Aslay released a new single, Kida, without consulting his bandmates.&ldquo;We were shocked by his move, but after we informed our boss Mkubwa Fella, he said we can go ahead and release our songs because we are growing in the industry,&rdquo; Beka said.However, Aslya said he is still in good terms with his colleagues.&ldquo;Whatever you have heard about the split are just rumours doing rounds on social media. They cannot be substantiated,&rdquo; he said.Mkubwa Fella, a financier of many Bongo artistes, including East Africa&rsquo;s finest Diamond Platnumz, said Yamoto Band is still strong and united.&ldquo;They are still a team because they still perform together,&rdquo; he said.Word Is has, however, established that Aslay has frequently been seen with Ali Kiba, who is the biggest rival of Diamond. Team Kiba and Diamond&rsquo;s Wasafi Classic are always in competition.
