A Ugandan thief rushed into a police station in Bungoma yesterday with a swarm of bees hot on his heels and confessed to stealing a car.Francis Sikadigu said the bees appeared every time he drove the car that was stolen on Friday.Yesterday, he jumped out of the car as the bees stung him and a curious crowd watched, he ran into the Bungoma police station, confessed, and kept running around the compound asking for assistance.The bees did not sting anyone else.When Sikadigu was still in the compound, the car owner came in with a traditional healer and the Ugandan ran to the healer and pleaded to be set free.The healer made the bees go away and Sikadigu was arrested.Bungoma South OCPD David Kirui said they are investigating.Vehicle owner John Wafula said that Sikadigu approached him on Friday evening and asked to hire five cars as he had won a contract to offer transport services for five days.Wafula said they met at a hotel in town to discuss the terms.&ldquo;He told me he wanted [Toyota] Premio and [Toyota] Axio models only, claiming he had been approached by some clients ... I told him that could be arranged as I have colleagues who could help him,&rdquo; he said.Wafula said they agreed on a cost of Sh5,000 for each car per day. He then stepped out to buy airtime to contact his colleagues.Wafula returned to the hotel and continued drinking his juice. He felt dizzy and woke up in hospital on Saturday morning. He did not have his car keys.Wafula then went to the traditional doctor, who assured him that his car will be found in three days and the thief will be attacked by a swarm of bees. &ldquo;I decided to visit one of these traditional doctors who assured me the suspect will not leave Bungoma town,&rdquo; he said.
