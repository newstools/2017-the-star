The electoral commission yesterday slapped Bungoma Governor Kenneth Lusaka and his rival Wycliffe Wangamati with Sh1 million fines each over the chaos in the county that claimed the life of one person.The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission held the two responsible for the June 2 chaos when their rowdy supporters clashed after being cleared to contest for the governor seat.The five-member IEBC Electoral Code of Conduct Enforcement Committee chaired by Wafula Chebukati said Lusaka and Wangamati violated the code by failing to prevent their supporters from clashing when they conducted separate rallies in Bungoma town.IEBC vice chairperson Consolata Nkatha, who read the ruling, said the committee&rsquo;s inquiry into the violence established that it &ldquo;was a case of show of might&rdquo; between Lusaka&rsquo;s Jubilee Party and Wangamati&rsquo;s Ford Kenya camps, impeding free and peaceful campaigns. &ldquo;We find that there was outright breach of the electoral code of conduct by both. Both are found culpable of the penalty. Lusaka and Wangamati are to pay Sh1 million fines each to IEBC within 24 hours from the time of pronouncement of this judgment, defiance thereof one stands to be disqualified as a candidate in the August 2017 General Election,&rdquo; she said.Lusaka had launched the complaint.
