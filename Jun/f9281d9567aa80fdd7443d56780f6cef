Embu Governor Martin Wambora has said he has finished many crucial projects, despite serious political wrangles, and he needs another term to complete unfinished ones. Wambora requested the residents to elect Jubilee aspirants as they are development conscious and have the best leadership qualities. He spoke on Wednesday at County Primary School in Embu Town, when he officially commissioned a milk feeding programme for all nursery school pupils in the county at a cost of Sh40 million a year. The governor said despite facing turbulent situation from his detractors, including being impeached and fighting the verdict, he has achieved milestones such as providing all local public schools with 12,000-litre water storage tanks. He said were it not for wrangles in the county, he would have done more. The governor said the county has hired more than 800 nursery school teachers on permanent and pensionable terms and provided a successful Sh20 million Youth Fund to help start businesses. This year, the amount will be increased to Sh25 million, he said. Wambora said the county obtained the governorâ€™s award for the most improved energy lighting system outside Nairobi. He said the Embu government has installed floodlights in 80 townships. The governor added that the county last year scooped the second position countrywide for the most improved maternity health services. Wambora further said Embu is the leading county in health information digital records keeping and dissemination. He promised that if he is reelected, he will work harder, implement more projects and recall investors who had signed agreements worth Sh441 billion with the county, but shied away because of wrangles. Wambora said the county will provide ploughing tractors at a subsidised fee to farmers so that more land is tilled and more food produced.
