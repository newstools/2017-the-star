An experimental therapy known as low-intensity shock wave treatment has been backed by doctors as a successful way to improve erectile dysfunction.A new survey has found a staggering seven in 10 physicians would use it on patients suffering impotence despite "contradictory research" on its effectiveness.It's news that would peak the interest of sufferers of the condition &ndash; where a man can&rsquo;t achieve or maintain an erection &ndash; which affects 60 per cent of men over the age of 60. Last year cricket legend Sir Ian Botham admitted to having the treatment &ndash; which involves jolts delivered through a probe applied to the penis &ndash; to keep his love life robust.Like popular medications for erectile dysfunction, low-intensity shock wave therapy focuses on the main cause of the problem, which is insufficient blood flow to the penis that makes it difficult to get and maintain an erection.But these pills are issued on an as-needed basis and may work for only one sexual encounter at a time, explain the study authors in the journal Sexual Medicine. Unlike oral medications such as Viagra, shock wave therapy could actually treat the cause of the problem &ndash; not just its symptoms, they suggest.However, shock wave therapy isn't approved to treat impotence in the US and UK but it is available privately from &pound;3,000. In an interview with the Sun on Sunday last year, Botham revealed he had a branded form of the treatment known as &lsquo;Vigore&rsquo;, for which he is an ambassador."It&rsquo;s prevention rather than cure. I didn&rsquo;t need the treatment but I didn&rsquo;t want to be worrying about it in ten years&rsquo; time," he said.KEY FINDINGSA team of international researchers surveyed 192 clinicians at the 18th Congress for the European Society for Sexual Medicine.Most of these specialised in urology, which commonly deals with erectile dysfunction. Overall, 103 of 144 (71.5 per cent) reported that they considered low-intensity shock wave treatment an effective treatment for the problem. Only 27 had performed the treatment themselves but of the physicians who recommended it, 37 had referred patients for the treatment.In recent years, the treatment has also been proposed for peyronie disease &ndash; the development of fibrous scar tissue inside the penis that causes curved, painful erections.But only 10 of all respondents (seven per cent) considered it a beneficial treatment for this condition."The overwhelmingly positive attitude toward low-intensity shock wave treatment in sexual medicine is somewhat surprising considering the limitations in the available literature," the researchers wrote."Although results have generally been disappointing for peyronie disease, there is currently hope that the method might provide a cure for ED."More those who thought it beneficial for impotence, more than 80 per cent recommended combining it with drugs such as Viagra. What exactly is shock wave treatment?Shock wave therapy, has been around since the 1980s and is used to treat patients with gallstones, kidney stones, heart problems, fractures and joint inflammation. In erectile dysfunction, it uses &lsquo;low acoustic&rsquo; sound waves to encourage new blood vessels to form, helping to improve blood flow to the region.Blood flow is critical to a man&rsquo;s erections. When a man is sexually stimulated, arteries widen so that his penis can fill with blood. To administer therapy, a clinician applies a probe to the penis, which is coated in a special gel.Different areas of the penis are usually targeted in treatment sessions that may last for up to 20 minutes.Men usually don&rsquo;t need anaesthesia or experience pain, although they might have a tingling sensation in the treated area, according to the International Society for Sexual Medicine (ISSM). What's the evidence? Dr Tom Lue of the University of California, San Francisco, examined data from 14 previously published studies including 833 patients from 2005 to 2015. "Basic research and clinical trials suggest that low-energy shock wave therapy can improve penile blood circulation," he previously told MailOnline.However, he warned that the long-term risks and benefits of shock treatment are still unknown."More studies are needed to determine the best dosage, the therapy may offer an alternative to men who can't take Viagra or didn't get the results they wanted from a pill," he added. Clinical trials of shockwave therapy for impotence have had 'encouraging results' and show it is 'well tolerated by patients' according to the ISSM.But men with more severe symptoms may still need to take medication in addition to having shockwave therapy, they noted.
