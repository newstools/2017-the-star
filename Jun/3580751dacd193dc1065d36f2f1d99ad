All revenue collection and enforcement agencies have been informed about the decision,&rdquo; he said.Mutua spoke to journalists in his Machakos office. He was with Finance executive Elizabeth Mutheu, chief officer Jacinta Masila and acting county secretary Grace Munguti.He also directed that all penalties for single business permits rates charged on salons, shops, barber shops, shoe shiners, kiosks and M-Pesa shops be lifted immediately.&ldquo;Any officer found charging increased fees or harassing traders should be reported to the relevant office for immediate disciplinary action,&rdquo; Mutua said.Mutua said he is committed to improving residents&rsquo; lives by offering key services for free.&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why the government has pioneered in offering free ambulance services to those in need,&rdquo; he said.Later, speaking at the Machakos People&rsquo;s Park during an Eid luncheon, Mutua urged politicians to stop inciting communities against each other.The Maendeleo Chap Chap party leader said leaders should not make statements that could trigger chaos.&ldquo;Some leaders are on record urging certain tribes to be kicked out of some areas. This is wrong,&rdquo; he said.Mutua said the politics of hate have no space in Kenya.&ldquo;Voters must shun tribal leaders who want to cause anarchy like it happened after the [disputed] 2007 polls,&rdquo; the governor said.He said Kenya cannot afford a repeat of the 2007-08 post-election violence, in which more than 1,000 people were killed, more than 600,000 displaced and property was destroyed.
