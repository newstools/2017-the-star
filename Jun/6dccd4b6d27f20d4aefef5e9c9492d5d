Kisumu residents are living in fear over increased robbery incidences in the past three weeks.Victims said thugs spray them with chloroform at night, which puts them into a deep sleep, giving the robbers enough time to steal. Some of the affected areas include Mamboleo, Lolwe, Kenya-Re and Nyamasaria.Last week, thugs raided Ritz Hotel in Mamboleo and stole mattresses, two TV sets, a table, an iPad, mobile phones and bags.The Ipad belonged to an American patron who was injured alongside a receptionist during the Wednesday night incident.They were treated and discharged.This comes barely a week after Nation journalist Justus Ochieng&rsquo;s house was robbed. Thugs made away with electronics and other household items.In Nyamasaria, suspects broke into a shop and stole goods worth thousands of shillings. County police commander Titus Yoma said some of the robberies have not been reported. Kisumu Residents Voice Association chairman Audi Ogada asked police to beef up security.
