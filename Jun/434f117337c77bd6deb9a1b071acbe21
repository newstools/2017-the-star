There is need for a strategic reserve of conserved feed for livestock to sustain milk production during periods of depressed rainfall, milk processing giant Brookside has said. &ldquo;Dairy farmers need to engage in smart farming now and for the future, and feed conservation is paramount towards succeeding in tackling the vagaries of weather,&rdquo; said John Gethi, Brookside director of milk procurement in a statement. He said there is need to strengthen strategic reserves for milk products which would be used to trigger a market correction during periods of drought, adding that recent rains have been insufficient in key raw milk production sheds in the country, affecting farm fodder and water supply for livestock. &ldquo;Milk production needs to be sustainable. In order to succeed in this, constant training of farmers is paramount, more importantly because it empowers raw milk suppliers with priceless knowledge on ways to grow production,&rdquo; Gethi said. He said vagaries of weather induce seasonal fluctuations in milk production, leading to both surplus and scarcity in periods of abundant rainfall and drought, respectively.He called for the involvement of youth in key interventions for the industry is critical in increasing milk production. &ldquo;The youth need to continue embracing dairy farming as a source of livelihood. They will be better placed in employing modern and smart techniques of dairy farming. The market for milk continues to expand, and the supply must grow hand in hand with the demand for this country to continue being self-sufficient with milk and continue creating employment.&rdquo;
