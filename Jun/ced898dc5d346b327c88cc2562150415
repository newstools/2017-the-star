It pains me as CS in charge of security that we have once again lost many good men and women," he said. "We assure you of government support during this hard time." His sentiments were echoed by the Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet who assured the service is still determined to win the war on terrorism."May 24 to May 30, 2017 remains the darkest period in the entire police fraternity. We lost 17 gallant officers through acts of terrorism," he said."They lost their lives in defense of our motherland and we owe them tribute for the ultimate price they paid."Boinnet said police will employ fresh approaches in dealing with al Shabaab insurgents so they are completely weeded out.The IG asked recruits at the college to remain patriotic and loyal to the service while dispensing their duties."We are engaged in a very complicated war but the losses will not dampen our spirits to overcome," he said.
