On Page 16 of this pullout, Prof Anyang&rsquo; Nyong&rsquo;o, the Senator from Kisumu county and ODM Kisumu governor candidate, ruminates on whether a free and fair election will be possible on August 8. Nyong&rsquo;o&rsquo;s focus is on the presidential poll. He remarks at one point, &ldquo;One could as well envisage a situation where this leads to a crisis, which paralyses voting on Election Day should agents disagree on the impartiality of this system. This would be a recipe for chaos ab initio&rdquo;.The number of agents in polling stations is going to be unprecedented for a Kenyan General Election when the independents, who number almost 5,000 are factored in. This will be a logistics nightmare, given there are some 41,000 polling stations nationwide. Is the IEBC foreseeing and preparing for such novel factors, or will the Wafula Chebukati-led team just stumble into an Election Day of unprecedented proportions and send out all the wrong signals?This year&rsquo;s is easily the biggest ballot paper in Kenyan electioneering, the electorate is the most numerous ever at 19 million to the nearest round number. And all signs are that turnouts will be in record numbers too.Polling station infrastructure might need a redesign. And it is only 44 days to Election Day.
