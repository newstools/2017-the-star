A fresh rift has emerged between Deputy President William Ruto and his allies in Uasin Gishu.Governor Jackson Mandago, Oscar Sudi (Kapseret) and Alfred Keter (Nandi Hills) have threatened to urge the Kalenjin community in Uasin Gishu to support the opposition to protest against businessman Bundotich Buzeki&rsquo;s bid for governor as an independent candidate.This declaration has angered a group of leaders in the county. They accused the trio of perpetrating tribal politics. Mandago on Sunday said he would urge his supporters to to vote for NASA if &ldquo;the other communities residing in Eldoret, especially the Kikuyu, decide to vote for Buzeki&rdquo;. Buzeki&rsquo;s bid is causing unease in Mandago&rsquo;s camp amid claims he is being supported by Ruto and some of his aides. A group of Mandago&rsquo;s campaigners, led by Joseph Chumba, met at Kuinet and said President Uhuru Kenyatta and Ruto should prevail upon Buzeki to step down just as they did with Nakuru Governor Kinuthia Mbugua. Mandago said, &ldquo;We also know how to vote . We will monitor on voting day. If we discover you are joking, we will tell our people we don&rsquo;t have to have the government on our side.&rdquo;
