Ivan Ssemwanga was laid to rest in an opulent ceremony - just the way he led his life - complete with money showers on the coffin and in the grave.It has been reported that the Ssemwanga family feared grave robbers could exhume the body to steal the expensive coffin bought in South Africa and the money which was thrown into the grave. So they did the only logical thing and got two Ugandan police officers armed with AK47 rifles to keep an eye on Ssemwanga&rsquo;s grave. This is a move that no one saw coming.The family also had an issue with Zari in terms of Ivan&rsquo;s wealth. Ivan was wealthy and there&rsquo;s bound to be drama when it comes to inheritance.
