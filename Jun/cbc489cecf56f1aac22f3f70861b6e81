The
Kwale government has denied colluding with Base Titanium to authorise extended
exploration of minerals in lands adjacent to the allowed
area. Governor
Salim Mvurya’s opponents, among them Wiper’s Chirau Mwakwere, have been
bashing him over an alleged underhand dealing to have the mining company and his
office grab some land and explore it for minerals. County director of communication Kauli Mwembe in a statement on Wednesday, said, "The claims are not only inaccurate but also misplaced, ill
conceived and at best a figment of the proponents imagination." Mwakwere,
Issa Chipera of ODM, Gereza Dena (independent) and Sammy Ruwa (independent), all eyeing Mvurya’s seat, have been using minerals and land issues to
discredit his administration. They claim his defection to Jubilee was a scheme
to grab and exploit land and minerals with "outsiders". In his visits to the county in February and May, President Uhuru Kenyatta defended
Mvurya against the allegations and threatened to expose Mwakwere’s "dirty deals",
while he was in government. In February, he said, “Those claiming Governor
Mvurya joined Jubilee to grab land in Kwale should know we have no interest in
anyone’s land. Everyone has the right to live anywhere and own land. If you
sell your land it is okay.” On Thursday, Mwembe said the Constitution and the Mining Act 2016, have vested the responsibility of issuance of special
mining licence in the national government. “There exists specific roles between the two levels
of government in regard to mining," . “It is evident therefore that the proponents of
this misleading narrative are deliberately choosing to misrepresent facts,
hence the need to set the record straight,” said Mwembe. In the statement, the director of communication
explained the chronology of events that led to Base Titanium admitting to its
intention to conduct further exploration in the county. Mwembe said the county has always acted in the
best interests of the locals. “Sometime in early September 2016, the Office of
the Governor learnt with shock and disbelief about the publication of an
application for a Special Prospecting License in the Kenya Gazette of 12th
August 2016m,” he said. Mvurya’s office learnt that the alleged renewal of
the current mining agreement by Base Titanium was for a further term of two
years from May 26, 2016. This caused anxiety and tension in the affected
areas of the Mrima Hills, forcing Mvurya to write to Mining CS Dan Kazungu, urging
him to revoke the whole process due to the apparent procedural and legal
inconsistencies. Kazungu attended a leaders
meeting at the Kenya School of Government in Matuga over the matter, Mwembe said. “After listening to all the stakeholders, the
CS directed that the exploration exercise be put on hold,
awaiting further direction from the ministry,” he said. “It is evident the county government of Kwale
has consistently advocated for the rights and the well-being of the people of Kwale,
and in particular, those in the areas targeted for exploration.”
