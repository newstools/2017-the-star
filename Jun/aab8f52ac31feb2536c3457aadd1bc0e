President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday returned the Finance Bill back to the National Assembly with recommendations that tax on betting, lotteries and gaming activities should be at 35 per cent.The National Treasury had proposed a uniform tax of 50 per cent rate in the Bill.Following stakeholder meetings, Parliament passed the Finance Bill 2017 by deleting the contentious clause on taxation for betting, lotteries and gaming activities.The MPs amended the clause reducing the taxable rate to a uniform 15 per cent.Uhuru, in a memorandum to speaker Justin Muturi, said he refused to sign the bill into law following the omission of the clause designed to discourage youth and vulnerable members of society from participating in betting activities.&ldquo;This totally negates the spirit underlying the proposal to have the betting tax rasied as pointed above,&rdquo; the president said.He instead recommended that clause 29 of the Bill be reinstated with amendment reading: &ldquo;Section 59B of the Betting, Lotteries and Gaming Act is amended in subsection ( 1 ) by deleting the word &ldquo;fifteen&rdquo; and substituting therefor the words &ldquo;thirty-five.&rdquo;While presenting the 2017-18 budget statement on March 30, Treasury CS Henry Rotich noted that betting and gaming had become widespread with very minimal regulation.Rotich had proposed the taxes be raised from 7.5 per cent (betting), 12 per cent (lottery), 15 per cent (gaming) and 15 per cent (competition) introduced in the Finance Act 2016 to a uniform tax rate of 50 per cent.Tax proceeds from these activities are set to go into the newly-established National Sports, Culture and Arts Fund to support development of sports, culture and arts in Kenya.Consultants at KPMG in an analysis of the Finance Bill 2017 had, however, argued the proposed 50 per cent tax is on the profits of the betting, lottery, gaming and prize competition entities and not on the winnings which may not achieve the policy objective of discouraging the youth and vulnerable members.&ldquo;This tax shall be chargeable to betting and gaming companies and it remains to be seen whether the 50 per cent tax will be in addition to the normal corporation tax of 30 per cent,&rdquo; stated the report.KRA commissioner general John Njiraini told the National Assembly on February 21 that the agency collected about Sh4.7 billion in corporate tax from betting firms in the last three financial years.
