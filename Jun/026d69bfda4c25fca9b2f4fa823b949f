Cancer patients are set to benefit from a modern treatment machine donated by the Indian government to the Kenyatta National Hospital from July.The Cobalt and simulator radiotherapy machine was pledged by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his visit to Kenya in July last year.It arrived in the country in October.The machine costs Sh120 million and is currently in its final stages of installation. Upon operation it will serve approximately 200 patients daily. The machine has adopted new treatment technology and will revolutionise the treatment of cancer. It kills cancer cells through &ldquo;pinpoint therapy&rdquo; without damaging surrounding tissue.This type of treatment is different from the old system, where tissue surrounding the tumour is also damaged. Speaking when she visited the Radio Africa Group offices in Westlands, Nairobi, Indian High Commissioner to Kenya Suchitra Durai said the equipment was set to restructure the Health sector and take it to a different level. &ldquo;It is a modern state-of-the-art machine that will bring a big change in the fight against cancer,&rdquo; Durai said.According to the 2016 Economic Survey, cancer is rated the third leading killer disease in Kenya after pneumonia and malaria. The disease accounts for seven per cent of total deaths per year.It records an estimated 40,000 new cases each year in the country and 60 per cent of those affected are younger than 70 years old, with the most common cancers affecting the breast, cervix, prostate and esophagus.Durai further said the Indian government is considering constructing a top-notch comprehensive cancer treatment centre at the Kenyatta National Hospital.&ldquo;We have received drafted proposal from the Kenyan government on the construction of a cancer treatment hospital and the Indian government is looking into it,&rdquo; the envoy said.The machine will strengthen KNH&rsquo;s capacity to handle cancer cases after suffering machine breakdowns in the recent past.Up until 2015, KNH was the only government facility that offered cancer treatment in the country. But in 2015, the government started opening up cancer centres across the country under the Managed Equipment Services programme that cost Sh38 billion. Currently, at least 94 hospitals across the country - two in each county - are set to have fully functional cancer treatment centres when the programme is completed.
