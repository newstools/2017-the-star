Garissa woman representative JP aspirant Annab Subow on Thursday launched her manifesto in Garissa town.She said atop her list would be to empower women through the Affirmative Action Fund and improve girls&rsquo; education.Subow said she would closely work with the county government to improve healthcare and reduce the mortality rate.&ldquo;I want to do things differently if elected. Our people have reached a point where they see no need of having this seat, thanks to the underperforming incumbent,&rdquo; she said.Subow criticised incumbent Shukran Gure, saying she is a big let down to the people of Garissa county.&ldquo;A honest assessment of her leadership reveals that she performed way below standard. She made no effort to empower our marginalised women and the youths. Even when she did so she focused on areas she comes from, displaying open bias,&rdquo; she said.Subow is the sole candidate from her Abuwak clan and a beneficiary of the negotiated democracy that brings together the Abduwak and the Samdahal through the Telamuge Alliance.She said Gure&rsquo;s leadership has failed.&ldquo;The people of Garissa have realised they made a big mistake in electing her. She lost touch with the electorate immediately she assumed office. The same voters are now ready to correct the mistake,&rdquo; Subow said.Gure has expressed confidence she will be reelected. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s meet at the ballot. I&rsquo;m sure of emerging victorious, especially now that I have become an experienced politician.&rdquo;
