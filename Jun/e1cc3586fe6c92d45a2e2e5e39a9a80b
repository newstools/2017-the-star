Raila is just an Opposition leader...I mean...a normal Kenyan."Ken Winda said the NASA flag bearer played his part by attending the function."Had he not attended he would have been branded unpatriotic but he beat them to it," Winda said.Nyar Joram said she was glad Raila did not speak since the ideal is to "tenda wema nenda zako (do good and leave) whether invited or not".Joram noted Raila would have demonstrated cowardice by giving the occasion a wide berth.Richard Cole asked: "Isn't it amazing thatRaila trends even without delivering a speech after being ignored?"Hundreds of Kenyans arrived as early as 6am at Kabiruini ASK showground despite the chilly weather.Guests walked into the venue as directed by police officers manning the gates.
