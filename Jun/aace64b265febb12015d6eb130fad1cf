Eleza wakenya."(The planes we have landed with here today are eiether goven to us by our loyal supporters, or we have leased them, i want to challenged Ruto to tell us the source of his helicopters)The governor also tore into the DP for the recent cases of Cholera in Weston hotel which is associated with Ruto."Huyo jamaa anaitwa arap Kipindupindu. Huu ugonjwa wa kipindupindu unaosambazwa kwa hoteli moja Nairobi tunatahadhari kwamba unasambaza kwa hoteli zingine Nairobi na Mombasa ambako umenunua kwa njia ambayo hatuelewi," he said.(The guy is now called the son of Cholera.
