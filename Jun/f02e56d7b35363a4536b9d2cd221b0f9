Meru Governor Peter Munya (pictured) on Thursday alleged deputy county commissioners are wrongly curtailing his freedom of movement. He said they are Igembe Central deputy county commissioner and his Tigania East counterpart. Munya said Nguyuyu Primary School head teacher was told to bar him from going to the school, but he still went. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need DCCs permission to hold a public rally in any school,&rdquo; he said. On Friday, Igembe Central deputy county commissioner Buston Mayabi said the Education ministry has long banned political meeting in schools.
