More than 2,500 Mau Forest IDPs from Nakuru have threatened to vote out President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto for omitting them in the ongoing resettlement process.The people who were kicked out of Mau Forest in Kuresoi by the grand coalition government question why they were left out in the list that DP Ruto announced last Sunday during his tour to Naivasha.The group visited by Ruto will be compensated next month.IDPs&rsquo; chairman Robert Mutai said Jubilee promised to fully compensate them when they came into power four years ago, but forgot them. &ldquo;DP Ruto has been pushing the blame of forceful eviction to Raila but we have proven that he is worse than Raila,&rdquo; Mutai told the journalists in Nakuru town on Tuesday.Mutai said the families living in Kipkongor, Kurpanyat, Kipkoris, Kipkongor, Saina and Kiletien camps lost their property during the eviction by Kenya Forest Officers who burnt their houses.They have been victims to poverty and diseases that have claimed several lives.&ldquo;It is unfortunate that we have lost children, old people and pregnant women to cold-related diseases for almost a decade but the government ignores us, saying we are not genuine IDPs,&rdquo; Mutai said.He said Ruto, who hails from the region, has remained quiet while Uhuru is dishing out money countrywide.&ldquo;We will not vote for them. It is better for us to vote in Raila so that we can bargain with him to resettle us with the help of Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto,&rdquo; Mutai said.The group chairman added that they will soon come out in large numbers to protest and rally the families and all locals to vote out Ruto and Uhuru.&ldquo;He used to be a sweet talker but we are dying under his watch.
