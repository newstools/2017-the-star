Baringo governor aspirant on the Jubilee ticket Stanley Kiptis yesterday dismissed claims he has hired county employees, saying he has got &ldquo;no pen to do so&rdquo;. Kiptis (pictured) said the propaganda is being spread byhis rivals to discredit him ahead of the August 8 polls.&ldquo;All the same, they will use all types of propaganda and malicious rumours. But I am full of confidence that the people who trusted and voted for me during the party primaries shall stand with me at the final election,&rdquo; Kiptis said.He said county employees under Governor Benjamin Cheboi are recruited competitively. &ldquo;Every qualified servant went through the Public Service Board. Who am I to disqualify them?&rdquo; Kiptis said on the phone. However, he acknowledged 71 per cent of youths in Baringo are jobless.
