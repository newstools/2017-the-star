ODM national chairman John Mbadi has dismissed claims the party imposed candidates on the people after shambolic nominations.He said the list of party nominees submitted to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission through the party&rsquo;s National Elections Board came from the returning officers who presided over the exercise.&ldquo;The nomination hitches ODM experienced during the polls should not be blamed on the party leadership. It rests with returning officers who announced the winners,&rdquo; Mbadi said.The Suba South MP said the returning officers mishandled the primaries conducted in April. Speaking on Ramogi FM&rsquo;s morning talk show yesterday, he apologised for the bungled polls.&ldquo;They conducted themselves in a manner that suggests they had been compromised. Some declared results with wrong figures, while others were at venues away from the tallying centres,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;In view of the above, the party regrets the poor way in which the elections were managed.&rdquo;Mbadi said the failure by ODM to vet aspirants seeking the party ticket could have contributed to the shambolic nominations. He accused political aspirants, whom he did not name, of riding on the ODM popularity, despite being friendly to rival parties.The lawmaker alleged aspirants wanted to cause confusion in the nominations. &ldquo;They were not ready to accept defeat,&rdquo; Mbadi said.He called for calm and urged party members to focus on helping the NASA presidential candidate, Raila Odinga, win the presidency.&ldquo;I appeal for concerted efforts from everyone who means well for NASA leadership to ensure they mobilise support for a win,&rdquo; Mbadi said. He said members should forget the past and unite for a common cause.
