Forced off ancestral land for an anti-terror operation, the Boni minority in Bar’goni and Pandanguo want to return to Boni Forest, calling it their only source of livelihood. The evicted community was urged to adopt farming but the majority say they can’t adapt to the new way of life. On September 11, 2015, the forest was declared a no-go zone by Kenya Defence Forces and the community ordered to keep away. A multi-agency onslaught — Operation Linda Boni — is trying to flush out al Shabaab militants hiding deep within the dense forest. The state periodically says the operation is a success but hasn’t called it off. In fact, 200-300 US Special Operations troops reportedly have partnered with Kenya in combatting the Jaysh Aman cell of the terror group. The operation followed a wave of attacks in Lamu county. The Bonis rely on the forest for a living. They hunt, gather fruits and harvest honey. They say the forest is a rich source of foods, animals and water that are essential to their way of life. Their shrines are in the forest. “Our lives have been miserable since the forest was declared a no-go zone. We can’t adapt to farming, it’s not what we enjoy doing,” a member of the community complained. Many say they are poorer and needier now than when they lived in the forest. They need assistance and handouts. They praised the anti-terror operation but said it’s high time they were considered. “We are forest people and our lives are tied to the Boni forest. We can’t do without the forest, just as we cant metamorphose overnight from hunters and gatherers into farmers,” Guyo Guratho said. “It’s like trying to turn a black baby white,which is impossible.We need to be allowed access to Boni Forest, that’s just how we have been socialised.” Elder Doza Dizo urged the government to compensate them for the entire period they have forced away from the forest. In April, Boni elders told the government to help them get the monthly stipend allocated to the elderly. They said they had never received the money. They accused the government of marginalising them and deliberately excluding them from the programme. “Why must there be double standards where the Boni people are concerned? Why must we be left out of everything? Are we not deserving?” Musa Guyo asked.
