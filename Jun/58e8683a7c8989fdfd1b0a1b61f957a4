The IEBC disputes' committee should have investigated the coalition agreement between CCU and Wiper before barring Wavinya Ndeti from running for governor, the High Court ruled yesterday.The IEBC had barred Ndeti, saying she belonged to two parties. But yesterday Justice George Odunga gave her the green light to run for office. He said the Political Parties Disputes Tribunal had made earlier made a decision that Ndeti was a bonafide member of Wiper and the IEBC committee had no powers to nullify that decision.Odunga said the court had found that the other issues raised before it as basis for justification of the committee&rsquo;s decision were not the grounds upon which it made its decision.The court said the committee had taken into account irrelevant material, hence its decision was irrational and unreasonable.On June 8, the IEBC committee nullified Ndeti's nomination, saying she belonged to two political parties.This is after Machakos MCA Peter Kyalo lodged a complaint with the committee, saying the former legislator was still a member CCU even though she had been nominated by Wiper.Wavinya then moved to the High Court to get orders to quash the decision to bar her.The IEBC, in its submissions, had argued that Wavinya was guilty of party hopping, which is an electoral offence because she had not resigned from her party before joining Wiper.The commission wanted the court to do uphold the decision it made and declare that she belonged to two political parties.Odunga said had the committee based its decision on the issues that were raised before him then the court might have reached a different outcome, but that is not the matter that was before him and he could not speculate.&ldquo;I find that the only basis upon which IEBC committee arrived at the decision made on June 8 cannot stand legal scrutiny and it was with due respect hopelessly unreasonable,&rdquo; he said.Odunga ordered the IEBC to include Wavinya&rsquo;s name as the Wiper governor nominee.
