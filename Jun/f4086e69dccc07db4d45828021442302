NASA is taking its war against the Sh2.5 billion ballot paper tender awarded to Al-Ghurair Publishing Company to the courts, 46 days to the general election.The opposition has accused the Dubai-based printer of having links with President Uhuru Kenyatta, who is seeking reelection for a second term in office on August 8.NASA wants the court to block the "tainted" Al-Ghurair company from printing 120 million ballot papers and a neutral printer selected through a consultative process involving all stakeholders.NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga said they have information that Al Ghurair has already printed presidential ballot papers, despite protests from the opposition.&ldquo;The tender is tainted. We are getting information that already ballot papers have been printed. We will go to the courts to block the tender,&rdquo; he said.Raila was accompanied by co-principal Musalia Mudavadi, who also heads the presidential campaign team.On Tuesday, IEBC chief executive Ezra Chiloba, during an interview with a local television, station ruled out cancellation of the tender, citing time constraints.He said printing of the ballot papers will start by the end of the week.Chairman Wafula Chebukati has also maintained the same stance, saying the commission is not keen on reviewing engagement with the Dubai printer.&ldquo;The position of the commission is very clear. We have given our reasons and invited NASA to give us theirs. If there are any grounds...any evidence that their allegations are true, then that can be considered,&rdquo; Chebukati said on Tuesday.Speaking yesterday at Okoa Kenya headquarters in Lavington, Raila announced they will move to court to block the contract, which he said will give Uhuru's Jubilee undue advantage in the election.He accused Jubilee officials of exerting pressure on the electoral body to award the tender to Al Ghurair "as if it was the only company".&ldquo;[The] IEBC is not acting on their own, they [Jubilee] are pushing the IEBC 'we must go to Dubai',&rdquo; Raila said.NASA has linked the firm to members of the Kenyatta family and senior players in Jubilee.
