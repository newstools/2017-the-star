A new report by the World Bank shows that Nairobi is among African cities that lack formal, planned housing that is connected to jobs and services. The report, "Africa's Cities opening doors to the World", says that three distinct characteristics constrain economic development and stifle growth: they are overcrowded, disconnected and costly. "Two [of the characteristics] appear directly in cities' physical structures and spatial form: They are crowded with people and dwellings and they are disconnected by lack of transport and other infrastructure.” Thirdly, and in part because they are disconnected, cities are costly. Indeed, they are among the costliest in the world, both for firms and for households - not least because of their inefficient spatial form," the report released last month says. According to the 162-page report, many cities in Africa are packed with people who live in unplanned, informal downtown dwellings to be near their jobs, with Nairobi topping the list. This, according to the report, is because the urbanisation of people is not accompanied by an urbanisation of capital. "Housing, infrastructure and other capital investments are lacking. Across the region, housing investments lag behind urbanisation by nine years," the report notes. The report says the underlying cause of crowding is that many African cities are not economically dense or efficient enough to promote scale economies and attract capital investments. It says cities should in principle benefit businesses and people through increased economic density. Firms clustered in cities should be able to access wider market on inputs and buyers, with reduced production costs as a result of economies of scale, it says. The report says workers should consume more diverse products and services, pay less for what they consume and enjoy easier commutes because of proximity to their jobs. However, this is not the case. Without adequate formal housing in reach of jobs, and without transport systems to connect people living further away, Africans forego services and amenities to live in cramped quarters near their work. Often informal, these downtown districts are likely to lack adequate infrastructure and access to basic services, the report notes. TRAFFIC JAMS According to the report, the prevalence of expansion and especially leapfrog development is one pattern that makes urban commuting challenging in most African cities, with the other being deficient transport infrastructure. Traffic congestion can hobble the economy with long commuting times, the report warns. It says the average journey-to-work travel time in Nairobi is one of the longest for global cities studied, with walking accounting for 41 per cent. But even if more city dwellers could afford transport by car or minibus, commuting would remain impractical for lack of roads, it says. According to the report, roads occupy far lower shares of urban land than in other cities around the world in eight representative African cities. The deficiency of urban road infrastructure is made worse by its extreme concentration near the core of African cities, leaving outer areas disconnected, the report says. Globally, over 50 per cent of the population live in urban areas today. It is expected that 95 per cent of global growth over the next 90 years will occur in developing countries, leading to increased exposure of population to climate change. Currently, the population in Nairobi, Kiambu and Gatanga stands at 6.1 million people, with 4.9 million in urban and 1.2 million in the rural part. The population in Nairobi county and its satellite towns is projected to rise to 13.4 million people by 2035. Mombasa and Kisumu are set to undergo major urbanisation. Report co-author Somik Lall said there is no country that has grown into middle income without urbanisation. Countries must grapple with how to tap challenges brought about by urbanisation into opportunities, he said, adding that the economic performance of Africa's cities is being limited by their urban form. Lall warned that if cities are not made livable, it will pose major problems. "Cities in Africa are experiencing rapid population growth that has not kept pace with economic growth," he said. Lall said that no matter the income levels, cities must have infrastructure in place. World Bank global lead of city management Roland White says that as cities grow, the negative impacts on natural environment, if unchecked, pose problems. He said cities such as Nairobi must step up measures to ensure encroachments are prevented. The report says African roads are disproportionately clustered near the centre. In Addis Ababa, Dar es Salaam, Kigali and Nairobi, paved roads drop off so abruptly outside the down town area that they nearly disappear. COST OF LIVING According to the report, spatial fragmentation of cities in Africa continues to prevent firms from reaping both scale and agglomeration benefits. This prevents scale economies by reducing workers’ access to jobs, thereby constraining firm size, the report adds, saying Africa's urban firms employ 20 per cent fewer workers on average compared to other firms elsewhere. Spatial fragmentation has also hindered agglomeration economies by preventing job market pooling and matching as well as the transfer of skills and knowledge — a special concern in light of African cities' low human capital endowments. Urban agglomeration economies thrive on knowledge spillovers, which presuppose a mix of specialised cognitive skills in the labour market. African urban workers are relatively poor in such skills, the report says. It adds that if workers are to be sorted by ability, then African cities will need, among other things, to restructure their labour market by attracting and growing more specialised talent. The report says city land is fragmented, with insufficient transport infrastructure making matters worse. It says that while underlying causes of the problems are regulatory and institutional, the effects of spatial fragmentation are material, limiting urban economies. The report attributes the higher cost of living in most cities to lack of dense spatial form and infrastructure connections. It says that while a higher cost of living affects workers, it ultimately is borne by urban firms. Higher wages means lower returns, unless workers are more productive. And without economic density that give rise to efficiency, African cities do not seem to increase worker productivity, and the result is that investment expectations remain low for cities in the region, the report adds. According to the report, Africa's cities higher urban living costs appear in rents, food prices, and prices of other goods and services. City dwellers pay around 35 per cent or more for food in Africa, as compared to low-income and middle-income countries elsewhere, a premium that looms larger given the high share of African household incomes that goes to food. The report says that even higher differentials apply to urban housing, which is 55 per cent higher in urban areas of urban countries, relative to their income levels and transport at 42 per cent higher than that cities elsewhere. Overall, urban households pay 20-31 percent more for goods and services in African countries than in other developing countries. The report says that urban workers in Africa incur high commuting costs or they simply cannot afford to commute by vehicle at all and must walk to work. SUPPRESSED LIVING STANDARDS It says the informal, often colourful, minibus systems that dominate collective motorised transit in most cities are far from cost-effective. For the poorest urban residents, especially, the cost of vehicle transport is prohibitive. The need to walk to work limits these resident's access to jobs, the report says. And since food and building costs are so high for households, workers and businesses, potential investors and trading partners have had to shy away. The need for higher wages to pay higher living costs makes firms less productive and competitive, keeping them out of trade-able sectors, the report says, adding that workers are also finding it hard to take and keep jobs that match their skills. The report blames underinvestment that has lead to low infrastructure. It says business investment decisions depend on the presence of other businesses — a firm's customer and its suppliers — and how a workplace that can be reached from residential areas. The report says that over the next 20 years, the growth of Africa's urban population will propel new demand for infrastructure, housing and other physical structures and amenities. And to meet the demand, city planners, city leaders will need adaptable strategies with plans and regulations that must allow the best use of land, but must also permit uses and users to change over time as demand evolves further. Other ills facing African cities that the report needs addressed are capital misallocation, institutional constraints and unclear property rights. It says the Kibera slum, whose land is owned by the government but managed by slumlords and political elites, for instance, has the potential, but those controlling have no interests in redeveloping it because they do not own it. The report says that rough calculations based on 1,000 acres of land at 4km from the center suggests that the gains of converting Kibera would reach Sh100 billion. The surplus generated by such transformation could be used to help relocate tenants and potentially buy off the people blocking redevelopment, but transformation would require making deals with slumlords, the report says. It also recommends for the adoption of a bus rapid transit, saying evidence shows that BRT reduces commuting times.
