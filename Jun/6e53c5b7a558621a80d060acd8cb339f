Children from the age of 10 years use bhang and cocaine in schools, a child and adult psychologist and anti-drug campaigner, Gladys Chania, has said.She said on Monday that the problem is worsening.Chania (pictured) spoke during the International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking &mdash; IDADA 2017 &mdash; in Ndumberi Grounds, Kiambu town. She blamed this on the fact that &ldquo;children are not supposed to be rehabilitated, but taken to approved schools, which do not cater for rehabilitation&rdquo;.&ldquo;We are having a problem when we have addictions among the underage because we cannot put them in the rehab centres together with the adults. Nacada should step in and provide solutions,&rdquo; Chania said.She proposed that students be tested for drug use when being enrolled in secondary schools, to check spiralling addiction.
