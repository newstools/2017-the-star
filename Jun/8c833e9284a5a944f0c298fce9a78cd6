NASA affiliate party candidates for the Bungoma Senate seat have rejected ODM leader Raila Odinga’s proposal that they step down for incumbent and Ford Kenya chief Moses Wetang’ula. On Saturday, ODM candidate Bonny Nyongesa and ANC’s David Makali dismissed Raila’s endorsement of Wetang’ula. Nyongesa said it was wrong for their party leader to endorse a candidate from an affiliate party, yet ODM has a nominee. His sentiments were echoed by branch chairman Ali Majani, who said ODM is not willing to sacrifice its candidate. He said Wetang’ula should let other contestants seek votes, instead of seeking endorsements. “Our candidate will be on the ballot and Ford Kenya should realise every candidate has a democratic right to contest for the seat,” Majani said. He said as a NASA co-principal, Wetang’ula is guaranteed a Cabinet post if the alliance wins, so “he should not come down to the Senate seat.” Majani said there is an agreement among co-principals to share seats and that Wetang’ula’s Senate bid is a sign he is not confident NASA will win. “He is trying to look for a fallback and such negativity is not needed,” he said.
