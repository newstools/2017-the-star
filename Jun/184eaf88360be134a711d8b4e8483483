The nurses&rsquo; clamour for better pay could be thrown into disarray following a fallout among the health workers union officials.The fallout and infighting among the leaders of the Kenya National Union of Nurses were laid bare yesterday when officials led by secretary general Seth Panyako, stormed and interrupted a press briefing called by chairman John Bii at Railways club.Bii was expected to issue a statement calling off the ongoing nurses&rsquo; strike, which enters its 13th day today (Saturday).It took the intervention of police to quell the heated altercation between the two camps, which almost degenerated into a fistfight.&ldquo;You are not an official of the union, we don&rsquo;t recognise you and you cannot talk on our behalf ,&rdquo; one of the men said.The more than 23,000 nurses across the 47 counties are demanding the registration of a collective bargaining agreement they say was negotiated and concluded in January.But the Council of Governors has termed the go slow illegal and ordered the health workers to resume work or be sacked.&ldquo;The return-to-work formula signed in December 2016 ended the strike in 2016. It is therefore unjustified that the current strike is a continuation of the last one,&rdquo; CoG human resource, labour and social welfare committee chairman and Kisii Governor James Ongwae said on Thursday.Bii, who had been removed from the union in February before being reinstated by the Employment and Labour Relation Court, had opposed the strike, terming it illegal.He argued Panyako, who is running for Kakamega governor at the August 8 polls, had not followed the procedure in calling for the strike.But Panyako, addressing journalists at the same venue moments after Bii&rsquo;s briefing was disrupted, maintained the strike is on. &ldquo;Those saying that the negotiations on the CBA had not been concluded are timid,&rdquo; he said.
