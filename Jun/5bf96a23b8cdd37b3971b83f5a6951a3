The petition to compel the IEBC to declare the provisional presidential results within seven hours will be mentioned next Monday. Kisumu High Court judge Justice Thripsisa Cherere directed the petitioners&rsquo; advocate, Kennedy Amondi, to serve the respondent [IEBC] with the application.Cherere further ordered that the suit be mentioned on June 19 before High Court judge Esther Maina for direction.Three voters in Kisumu Titus Alila, Jackline Otieno and Francis Ogada &ndash;want the court to compel the IEBC to declare provisional presidential results within seven hours after closure of polling stations to avoid anxiety.They filed the application under a certificate of urgency, saying delays in announcing the results are likely to cause violence. Th e petitioners who filed the application on their own and as registered officials of Sumawe Youth Group, said delays in announcing the results may trigger chaos.Through lawyer Amondi, the applicants said the suit is of public interest since Kenyans have invested Sh3.8billion in the Kenya Integrated Election Management System. In their application, they say KIEMS is meant to ensure credible electronic results transmission from the polling stations to the national tallying center. &ldquo;It is in the public interest that the IEBC is compelled to release tallying provision presidential election results at least six hours after the closure of the polling stations,&rdquo; reads the suit. Th e petitioners said experience has shown that the delay in announcing presidential election results is a harbinger for creating anxiety, confusion and at worst,violence.Th e suit also says that delay in re-leasing the provisional presidential results winner may give room for ballot stuffing, thereby compromising the integrity of the entire electoral process.
