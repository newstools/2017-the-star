A Senate aspirant who was late after travelling to Nairobi to seek a document was denied clearance by the IEBC.PNU Embu Senate seat nominee Pitts Mugambi was on Tuesday barred from contesting for presenting his papers a day late after reportedly travelling to Nairobi to seek a crucial document needed for clearance.Mugambi, who resigned from the Embu County Public Service Board to run, was turned away from Tana and Athi Water Authority offices where parties&rsquo; nominees and independent candidates have been presenting their papers.IEBC Embu county returning officer Daniel Lenarum declared Mugambi time barred and declined to accept his papers for clearance.Efforts by Mugambi to persuade the officer to accept the papers by explaining to him that he was delayed by unavoidable circumstances fell on deaf ears. The officer adamantly declined to accept them.Mugambi said he went to Nairobi on Monday to collect a &lsquo;crucial document&rsquo; that was required for the nominations by the electoral commission.He said he called the returning officer to tell him about the mission and asked him to wait for him as he expected to arrive in Embu in the evening.Mugambi said two of his car tyres had punctures and by the time he had bought and changed them, it was too late. He said he informed the returning officer about the incident.Mugambi said on calling the officer, he advised him to deliver the papers on Tuesday morning. He, however, said when he met the returning officer he refused to clear him.
