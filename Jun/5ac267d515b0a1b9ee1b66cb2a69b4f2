NASA has given a seven-day ultimatum to Director of Public Prosecutions Keriako Tobiko to prosecute seven CSs for allegedly using state resources in championing Jubilee&rsquo;s reelection.The Opposition top brass wants the IEBC to penalise President Uhuru Kenyatta for allegedly bankrolling his reelection from state coffers and using government funds to lure voters.In what signals a tough political battle ahead, NASA has pledged to institute private prosecutions against the key Uhuru allies if Tobiko fails to crack the whip in seven days.&ldquo;Take notice that if you do not take appropriate action against the said officers within seven days from the date hereof, NASA will have no alternative but to instruct our lawyers to institute private prosecutions,&rdquo; a letter by Raila&rsquo;s lawyer Paul Mwangi reads in part.Education CS Fred Matiangi, Eugene Wamalwa (Water), Mwangi Kiunjuri (Devolution) and Joseph Nkaissery of Interior are among leaders targeted by NASA.The alliance wants James Macharia (Transport), Najib Balala (Tourism) and Cleopa Mailu (Health) charged, in a precedent-setting move.Addressing a press conference in Nairobi yesterday, the NASA chiefs led by Musalia Mudavadi also singled out Energy PS Joseph Njoroge and KRA boss John Njiraini for bankrolling Uhuru&rsquo;s campaigns. &ldquo;When the head of government&rsquo;s chief revenue collection agency KRA is a direct donor of taxpayers&rsquo; money to a political party, then the National Treasury and the economy is in jeopardy,&rdquo; said a tough-talking Musalia.Njiraini and Njoroge are part of the technical committee operating under the umbrella of the Friends of Jubilee Foundation that last Friday raised Sh500 million for Uhuru&rsquo;s campaigns. The Law Society of Kenya had also censured the two government officials and called for their prosecution. The state-funded Kenya National Commission on Human Rights had protested that Uhuru is using state resources and claimed some of his moves amount to voter bribery.Yesterday, NASA protested the IEBC does not need prompting to penalise Uhuru for using the Presidential Delivery Portal to advertise Jubilee messages.&ldquo;In any case, the government and the state of the Republic of Kenya are not on the ballot. It&rsquo;s Uhuru Kenyatta who is on the ballot,&rdquo; Musalia said.Siaya Senator James Orengo said nothing bars the DPP from launching a probe against Uhuru.
