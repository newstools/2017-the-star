PHOTO/SPNIn a cagey first half, the record 15-time Kenyan champions did not take long to impose themselves in the game, bossing possession as the Zanzibari side sat back deep.Assistant head coach Zedekiah &lsquo;Zico&rsquo; Otieno paired Kagere with Timothy Otieno up front for Gor with 2016 SPL Player of the Year, Kenneth Muguna pulling strings behind the pair.Kagere bought space in the 18th minutes at the edge of the box when he lost Jang&rsquo;ombe&rsquo;s right full back on the turn but opted to fire just wide with Otieno better placed for the finish.Gor went forth and in the 30th, Kagere&rsquo;s header from a corner flew wide before Otieno missed another chance as the sides went level on the break.Former Harambee Stars coach, Otieno threw on former SPL Player of the Year, George &lsquo;Blackberry&rsquo; Odhiambo on minutes after the break for Mike Simiyu to add more impetus to attack.The substitute let fly from range in the 61st but his shot fizzled out just wide but three minutes later, Jang&rsquo;ombe finally cracked when Kagere got his first.With Odhiambo dominating the left, it was only a matter of time before they extended their lead and Kagere put the match to bed when he converted from the spot following a handball in the area.
