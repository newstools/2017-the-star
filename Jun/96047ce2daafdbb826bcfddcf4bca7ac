Embu Governor Martin Wambora has referred to Senator Lenny Kivuti as a liar for claiming that Wambora had misused over Sh23 billion in the last four years.In a campaign rally on Saturday, Kivuti claimed that in his four years of governance Wambora had received more than Sh23 billion from the national government which he, as the senator, had negotiated for the county.But Wambora denied the allegations and said, &ldquo;Kivuti has not at all negotiated for any funds to be given to Embu county. What we got is our rightful share according to the allocations.&rdquo;Kivuti is just using lies as a campaign tool to alarm voters so he can win the August 8 election, he said.The governor added that Embu has not received more than Sh4 billion from the state in any year.Kivuti said after the money was disbursed to the county, but there is nothing to show for it in terms of developments at the grassroots.Speaking at Umau Stadium in Kiritiri town, Mbeere South, the senator said he is the most qualified person to be governor, as he has negotiated for many projects from the national government.
