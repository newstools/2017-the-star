Meru Senator Kiraitu Murungi has said he is the one who made Meru Governor Peter Munya what he is today and vowed to bring him down.Kiraitu said in 2013, he vigorously campaigned for him and were it not for him Munya would not have clinched the governor seat.The senator spoke on Monday at Kithangari, South Imenti constituency, where he held a vote-hunting campaign just a day after Munya raided the area that is his backyard.Munya held a PNU rally in Shabba Stadium, where he presented an Ajua game to residents, and told them to give it to Kiraitu.He said Kiraitu will play the game when he retires on August 8. But Kiraitu has come out guns blazing. The &ldquo;Meru King of politics&rdquo; (as he is often called) has said he is the one who put the tortoise on the tree.&ldquo;The people are tired of this tortoise since it has become arrogant. I am the one that will put it down since the time has come,&rdquo; Kiraitu said. He was referring to how he will trounce Munya in the governor election. &ldquo;I am the one who taught Munya when he was a law intern. I admitted him to my law firm,&rdquo; Kiraitu said.He asked Meru voters to vote out Munya for failing to initiate water projects.Kiraitu said the mismanagement of county funds presided over by Munya pushed him to run for governor to rescue Meru. &ldquo;I am doing this out of the pain of seeing Meru people suffer under Munya&rsquo;s leadership, yet he is misappropriating county funds,&rdquo; Kiraitu said.The senator said Munya has embezzled Sh68 million meant to upgrade Kinoru Stadium, and Sh37 million for a grass-planting project in Meru town.Kiraitu also questioned why Munya is renovating Meru County Hotel at a cost of Sh200 million, instead of building a new one.He said the renovation cannot cost more than 100 million.On May 18, the paths of Munya and his rival Kiraitu crossed in Muthara,Tigania East, during campaigns.Kiraitu had just finished addressing a rally at Muthara market and the crowd had not yet dispersed, when Munya arrived in a convoy.Kiraitu promised to address water shortage if elected but Munya urged residents to ignore Kiraitu and reelect
