The IEBC had ordered and received 50 per cent of required ballot papers by June 22, lawyers said on Tuesday at the beginning of hearings on a NASA petition.Three High Court judges will determine a petition by the National Super Alliance, which says President Uhuru Kenyatta influenced the tender to Dubai-based Al Ghurair printing firm.The Dubai firm is to print about 130 million ballot papers for the August 8 polls.In a statement earlier on Tuesday, the firm denied having links with the President and claims that their officials met him at State House.More on this: We have never met Uhuru, Al Ghurair now claims in affidavitIn their submissions, defense lawyers further said the commission has received approvals to print ballot papers for governor, senator, and woman MP and is awaiting the approval for others."It is worth noting that 80 per cent of the governor ballots and 25 per cent of the woman representative [post] were completed by the time of swearing this affidavit," they said.They added the electoral agency has committed a huge amount of resources into the procurement of ballot papers and other raw materials which typically constitute 85 per cent of the production cost.The Opposition coalition suffered a setback last week after the High Court refused to cancel the controversial Sh2.5 billion tender.Judge George Odunga directed Chief Justice David Maraga to form the three-judge bench.Read: Odunga refuses to suspend Al Ghurair tender, asks Maraga to assign judges to caseAead: IEBC won't cancel Al Ghurair tender, NASA free to boycott poll - ChebukatiBearing in mind the election is just 41 days away, IEBC has raised concerns that it might not be able to meet the deadline of printing the papers.Chairman Wafula chebukati said the commission is looking into a speedy conclusion to the matter as printing has begun for elective posts with no disputes.&ldquo;The commission approved ballot printing for most of the candidates where there are no issues. There are a few cases in court...that percentage is still being worked out because we have received some court orders which we want to enforce,&rdquo; he said.
