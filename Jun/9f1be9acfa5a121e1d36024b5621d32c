Murang&rsquo;a Governor Mwangi Wairia has been cleared by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission a day after a resident filed a petition in court seeking to have him barred from running over integrity issues.In a low- profiled clearance, uncharacteristic of Wairia, he presented his papers to the IEBC at 8.30am amid fears he would not be cleared.On Wednesday, Jackson Kiroko moved to court. Kiroko claims Wairia has not passed the integrity test as required by the Constitution, and urged the court to direct the Director of Public Prosecutions to investigate him and institute a criminal case against him for corruption.The governor, running on the Jubilee ticket, praised the IEBC for clearing him and thanked Murang&rsquo;a residents for nominating him.Wairia will faceoff with Moses Mwangi on the Mzalendo Sabasaba ticket. The governor picked former Kandara MP Maina Kamau as his running mate to replace Gakure Monyo, who openly criticised his leadership and teamed up with his rival Jamleck Kamau. &ldquo;Maina has a lot of experience in leadership and public service,&rdquo; Wairia said.
