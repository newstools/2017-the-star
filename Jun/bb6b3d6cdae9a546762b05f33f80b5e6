Two journalists based in Meru have quit their jobs and have been issued certificates to run for MCA. Titus Mutuigi and Muthaura Njogu, running as  independents, aim to represent Nyaki East and Nkuene wards, respectively. They resigned from  Meru FM. Speaking to supporters at Nkubu on Wednesday after being cleared by the South Imenti returning officer, Muthaura warned against six-piece suit voting. He urged residents to vote based on candidates’ ability to deliver. There was no immediate comment from Mutuigi. “If election is about parties, then President Uhuru Kenyatta who was elected on the TNA party, Governor Peter Munya and Senator Kiraitu Murungi on the APK party tickets would not be in office. Buuri MP Kinoti Gatobu was elected as an independent ticket and he has delivered. “The six-piece suit is retrogressive because it makes people cry for five years after electing incapable leaders,” Muthaura said. He said if elected he will use his wide network and knowledge to improve healthcare, get rid of middlemen and cartels who fleece farmers. Muthaura said he would push for the establishment of a state-of-the-art music studio.
