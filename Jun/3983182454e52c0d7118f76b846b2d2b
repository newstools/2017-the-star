NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga will today take his campaigns to Nakuru county in a bid to amass support in the region ahead of the August 8 polls.Raila will be accompanied by his running mate Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper), Musalia Mudavadi (ANC), Isaac Rutto (CCM), and Moses Wetang'ula (Ford -K). The opposition team will address rallies in Naivasha and Kuresoi.Nakuru CCM governor aspirant Peter Koros and woman representative Gladys Kamuren said all is set for the opposition leader's tour."I can now confirm that everything is set for Raila's tour to Naivasha and Kuresoi," Kamuren said on Wednesday.Locals living in lower parts of Nakuru within the Mau forest complex want Raila to clear the air on whether he plans to carry out massive eviction if he wins the Presidency as rumoured."We want to support NASA but we fear that Raila will make us IDPS again. So we want him to come and tell us his plans if he wins. Otherwise, NASA principals are performers," John Koech, resident, said.While visiting the county in May, NASA principals threatened to boycott the elections if an appeal logged by IEBC goes through.The electoral body wants the appellate court to overturn a High court ruling that election results announced at the constituency level are final.But the opposition agues that such an environment is likely to give room for manipulation of poll results. The commission has anchored its argument on the constitutional provision that gives it the mandate to declare winners during elections."We will not allow IEBC to tamper with the court ruling on the tallying issues. If they will, let them know that no elections will be held," NASA coalition flag bearer Raila Odinga said.More on this: NASA threatens to boycott polls if IEBC appeal on vote tallying goes through
