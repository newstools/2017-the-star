Electricity bills are set to drop slightly from next month when the Isinya substation is switched on, enabling the evacuation of geothermal power from Naivasha to Mombasa, the Kenya Power said yesterday.The transmission will enable the near-monopoly power distributor to cut some of the expensive thermal electricity from the mix at the Coast, acting chief executive Ken Tarus said.The 400-kilovolt Suswa -Isinya transmission line was completed last month, he added, and is set for commissioning by President Uhuru Kenyatta by the end of the month.Addressing reporters during the Great Energy Debate in Nairobi, Tarus attributed the recent rise in the cost of power to hydrological conditions caused by inadequate rainfall. This followed a biting drought from fourth quarter of 2016 through the first quarter of this year.The cost of 50 kilowatt-hour (units) averaged Sh573.67 in May, according to data collated by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, a rise of 7.4 per cent from Sh534.30 the year before.&ldquo;We have since increased power generation coming from geothermal, and reduced generation of power coming from thermal which is very expensive,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This in itself is a big contribution to the reduction of the cost power,&rdquo; Tarus said.The country has installed capacity of 2,333 MW of electricity with demand standing at 1,650MW.The government had planned to install an additional 5,000 MW in 42 months from September 2013 under the ambitious 5,000MW-plus project through public-private partnership. This has, however, been shelved due to low demand which is largely driven by building and construction sector as opposed to manufacturing sector which was envisaged when the plan was mooted.In the 2016-2017 financial year, Kenya power invested Sh35 billion to refurbish their network and intends to pump Sh109 billion for the next four years in bid to provide quality supply to customers.The power distributor is implementing a Sh13.2 billion underground cabling project in Nairobi aimed at providing alternative electricity supply in case of a blackout.
