A man was stabbed to death following a confrontation between Awendo MP Jared K'Opiyo and Walter Owino's supporters on Sunday. North Sakwa chief Joseph Nyogilo said Odhiambo Kangilo alias Singh died after he was stabbed several times in the back. The chief said the death occurred hours
after Owino (ODM candidate) had just held a rally in the area and left. But Owino distanced
himself from the incident saying that he has been away in Nairobi. "I only learned about the unfortunate incident on Monday morning. It is very sad to lose people because of politics," Owino said. The victim of the fracas passed on while being rushed to a private
hospital in Kisumu after being referred from Migori referral hospital. "It is most likely that he was chased, fell down before he was
attacked by a mob armed with knives," Nyogilo said. Angry villagers took Kangilo's body from
the ambulance and marched with it on the hospital stretcher towards his
village. "They burned down a boda boda shade
erected by one of the politicians they accused of being behind the death," the chief said. "The youths had also threatened to burn several homes belonging to the suspects before we called for
calm." The body was taken to a mortuary in Awendo town. "So far, we have informed police about two key suspects who will help with further investigations once arrested," the chief said. K'Opiyo, who is vying as an independent candidate in the August polls, did not answer phone calls and messages when contacted.
