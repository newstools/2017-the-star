The East African countries are likely to adopt changes in TB diagnosis, treatment of malaria and use of antibiotics to treat diarrhoea, following findings of a four-year regional research project.The findings presented at a meeting in Arusha on Friday, make key recommendations with significant policy implications in public healthcare for the five regional countries. For instance, on TB laboratory diagnosis, the study presented by Dr Willie Githui from the Kenya Medical Research Institute calls for complementary use of GeneXpert and Microscopy.&ldquo;While regional countries are adopting the use of the GeneXpert as the ideal tool for TB detection due to significantly higher sensitivity than microscopy and incremental benefit in smear negative specimens, LED-FM microscopy has a significantly higher specificity than GeneXpert,&rdquo; Githui said. Githui said LED-FM microscopy has better likelihood of detecting culture positive, which is a confirmation of the disease.The researchers therefore recommend that LED-FM microscopy should complement the GeneXpert technology, especially in regions with inadequate capacity, including infrastructure, human resource and high workload.On malaria, it was established there is reduced efficacy of the artemisinin-based combination therapy.However, this reduction was not significantly different between the artemether lumefantrine and dihydroartemisinin.The study therefore recommends that DP, which is a second-line drug due to previous efficiency above the expected WHO recommended levels, be adopted as a first-line drug.The 10th East Africa Public Health Laboratory Networking Project meeting was attended by at least 40 experts, including respective Ministry of Health officials from the five East African countries of Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda and Tanzania.
