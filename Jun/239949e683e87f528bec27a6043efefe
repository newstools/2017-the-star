The Council of Governors takes great exception with the treatment of one of our members, the Governor of Mombasa County, H.E. Hassan Joho during the launch of SGR in Miritini.This is the second time in less than six months that the State Department of Interior and National Coordination has quarantined H.E Hassan Joho to prevent him from attending a public event in his own County.Article 6(1), (2) of the constitution clearly states that Kenya is divided into Counties and that the National and County Governments are distinct and interdependent and shall run their business through mutual relations. Therefore, Council of Governors wishes to state:-1. While we appreciate that Kenya is in an electioneering period, State Department of Interior and National Coordination must note that the Office of the Governor is a constitutional office that must be treated with the respect it deserves. The Governor&rsquo;s Office must be afforded constitutional protections. H.E. Hassan Joho holds Constitutional office until the next Governor of Mombasa County is sworn in.2. National Government should state whether through State Department of Interior and National Coordination it has suspended the constitution of Kenya to engage in strong arm tactics practiced by former Romania&rsquo;s leader the late Nicolae Ceau&#537;escu.3. While the National Government can exclude a Governor from its lineup of speakers at its functions, it cannot bar the Governor from attending a public event being held in his County Government and attended by his voters.Council of Governors affirms that department of Interior and National Coordination is bound by the constitution of Kenya and cannot operate like a rogue government agency. Council of Governors expects that the above rights will enforced without exception before the department extends its illegal orders of quarantining Governors to House arrest.H.E.
