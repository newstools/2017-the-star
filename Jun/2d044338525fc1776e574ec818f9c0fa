Environmentalists now want the sisal sector revived so that sisal baskets can be used as an alternative packaging material when the proposed ban on plastic bags is implemented. The water hyacinth weed, which has invaded Lakes Victoria and Naivasha, could also be used to weave baskets to replace the plastic papers. This emerged during celebrations to mark the World Environmental Day at Naivasha G.K Prison, where stakeholders joined inmates and warders in planting trees. Addressing the press during the function, the executive director of Center for Environmental Action Karanja Njoroge welcomed the move to ban the plastic papers. &ldquo;We have continued to witness mountains of garbage in our towns with the plastic bags contributing to this and it&rsquo;s time we got rid of this menace forever,&rdquo; he said. He noted that, for years, the papers which are hard to recycle have continued to affect the environment and also killed hundreds of livestock. Sisal baskets, he said, could come in handy to replace the plastic bags, creating job opportunities for those who will be laid off when plastic bags firms close down. &ldquo;Traders involved in the sector have opposed the ban but we are fully behind the CS for Environment (Judi Wakhungu) in this fight,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;The invasive hyacinth weed in Lake Naivasha and Victoria can be used to weave baskets which will be used for shopping instead of the plastic bags.&rdquo;
