A group of elders on Sunday handed NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga the Nandi traditional instruments of leadership inherited from the legendary Laibon Koitalel Samoei.The elders also crowned Raila during an elaborate ceremony in Kapsabet showground on Sunday.The same elders had been sent away away from a presidential function in Kimondi on December 9 last year by security officers as they prepared to crown President Uhuru Kenyatta.The infuriated Talai elders left the venue in a huff, vowing never to return the cloak &ldquo;Sambut&rdquo; and a peace rod &ldquo;shariit&rdquo;.Raila was made to seat on a four-legged stool that was sprinkled with oil and milk. Elders led by Christopher Koiyoki and Christopher Meli represented the Nandi subclans.Koiyoki said a heavy downpour that preceded the ceremony was a sign of good fortunes that await the NASA leadership.&ldquo;We have waited for this day for a long time&hellip;Some people did not want us to give you our blessings, but we have finally succeeded,&rdquo; he said.A similar ceremony was carried out in December 1964 on founding President Jomo Kenyatta at State house in Nakuru.
