Gunmen killed three people, including a police officer, outside Equity Bank in Mandera's Elwak town on Friday morning.Northeastern regional coordinator Mohamud Saleh confirmed the attack but said they had not established the number of gunmen.&ldquo;They opened fire and indiscriminately killed three people. The officer had been guarding the bank,&rdquo; he said.Another officer was stationed inside the facility.The other victims, who were civilians, were standing outside the bank.Saleh said police responded swiftly but that the assailants had escaped by the time they arrived.&ldquo;We are seeking to establish whether it was an attempted robbery or if al Shabaab militants were involved," he said.The terrorists who cross over from Somalia have been carrying out sporadic attacks in North Eastern.But a witness said the gunmen seemed to have planned to kill the police officer.&ldquo;I think the civilians were only victims of circumstance. They may have been killed to make it harder to identify the attackers," said the source who did not want to be named.Officers from the military and regular police cordoned off the area and launched a search for suspects.More on this: Mandera curfew extended after al Shabaab IED attacksAlso read: Suspected al Shabaab militants kill chief, abduct two KPRs in Mandera
