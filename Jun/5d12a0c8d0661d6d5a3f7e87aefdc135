NASA presidential running mate Kalonzo Musyoka on Friday criticised the Jubilee administration for &ldquo;an exclusive Madaraka Day fete&rdquo;. He accused Jubilee of mocking the 54th celebrations of Kenya&rsquo;s self-rule by ignoring the true champions of democracy. In a statement, Kalonzo (pictured) hit out at the President for perpetuating division even during national events by ignoring leaders who have made big sacrifices to expand the democratic space.
