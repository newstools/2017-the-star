Four pupils killed in a landmine have been buried at Kiunga in Lamu East.The four were killed alongside four police officers when the vehicle they were travelling in hit a landmine suspected to have been planted by al Shabaab at Mararani.Community leaders urged the Kenya Defence Forces and other security personnel in Operation Linda Boni to stick to their designated operation routes and avoid those marked for civilian use.The initial burial location was in Mararani village but was changed at the last minute to Kiunga in Lamu.The decision was informed by the inaccessibility of the area under heavy military operation.The four bodies were ferried by the KDF for burial in Kiunga. The ceremony was conducted under heavy security from the KDF and regular police.Meanwhile, five AP officers and four children that went missing shortly after the attack at Mararani on Tuesday afternoon tracked their way back to the Mararani Rural Border Patrol Unit camp by Wednesday morning.A police statement issued to the media showed one AP officer and two children who were seriously injured were airlifted by a KDF chopper and taken to the hospital. According to police reports, four police officers and four pupils hid in the forest after which they crawled to the RBPU camp at Mangai, where they received help.Residents told the government to address the issue of insecurity and terrorism in Basuba and Lamu East urgently.Community leaders urged KDF and other security personnel to stick to their designated operation routes.They said civilians are becoming collateral damage when militants pursue the officers. When the Linda Boni Operation was commissioned in 2015, civilian and security routes were clearly marked, with either side told to stick to their respective sides.But residents say the security units have been using civilian routes and the militants have begun planting IEDs and landmines and launching attacks on routes used by the civillians.During the burial, the community urged the military and other security agencies not to use the Kiunga-Mkokoni highway since it is the only road available for civilian use.&ldquo;The KDF made it clear that we were to keep off Basuba-Kiunga highway and we did respect that.We were told the Mkokoni-Kiunga road was to be used by civilians but police also use it,&rdquo; said resident Yunus Mohamed.He said the only groups that should use the civilian route should be businessmen, farmers transporting their produce, fishermen and county government officers out to supervise projects and community development plans. Residents say there is a need for more soldiers and police to be deployed to the area.
