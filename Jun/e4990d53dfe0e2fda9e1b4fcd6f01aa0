They are headed home," he said.He spoke on Friday during campaigns in Cheptais, Sirisia and Bumula in Bungoma county where he asked National Super Alliance supporters to abstain from sex on the eve of elections."When you are going for war, sex is a bad omen," he said.The Opposition chief said their coalition will now embark on tallying and announcing their own results."We will keep vigil at all polling stations, tally our own results, announce what we have and compare it with what the IEBC will have."Read: Raila warns police against rigging, says NASA will go toe to toe with IEBCThe ODM leader said the August 8 vote will be one of protest by Kenyans who have been facing tough economic times.A maize shortage saw the rise of prices of flour alongside those of basic commodities including rice, milk and rice."The elections are going to be about the unga revolution. We can no longer sit and watch as they rape our economy," he said.Raila termed the Jubilee administration a corrupt regime that is insensitive to the plight of Kenyans."This is a government of thieves. They have looted in every ministry. It is high time we sent them home," he said.The presidential candidate wondered why the government refused to buy maize from farmers at Sh4,200 yet imported the food item from Mexico."They are killing the morale of our farmers. They are not interested in helping them but stealing."NASA principal Moses Wetang'ula, who is Bungoma Senator and Ford Kenya leader, said Jubilee leaders do not deserve a second term as they have ruined the country.Wetang'ula said Deputy President William Ruto has a long history of corruption and that this is why he has never been employed."Since he left university he has just been on a looting spree," he said.Ruto has denied the allegations.Regarding his decision to vie for re-election as Senator, the party leader said he had to sacrifice his presidential ambition to emancipate Kenyans from Jubilee.They are only duping Kenyans with projects initiated by the Mwai Kibaki regime, he said.Read: NASA principal Wetang'ula will vie for re-election as Bungoma Senator - Ford KenyaWetang'ula castigated Bungoma Governor Kenneth Lusaka and Water CS Eugene Wamalwa for supporting Jubilee, saying they were being guided by selfish interests.
