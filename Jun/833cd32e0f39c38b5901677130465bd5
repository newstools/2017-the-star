A Naivasha court has released police impostor Joshua Waiganjo (pictured) on bond. Naivasha chief magistrate Dominica Nyambu set the bond at Sh500,000 and a surety of the same, or Sh200,000 bail. The move comes a week after Waiganjo was charged afresh with five charges of impersonation and being in possession of police uniforms. Waiganjo denied the charges, but the prosecution opposed his release on bond. The court set the hearing for October 12.
