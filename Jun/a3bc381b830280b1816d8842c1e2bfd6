Ruling party Jubilee has lately prided itself on its infrastructure projects &ndash; the SGR, electrification, roads and healthcare. However, the hospital equipment scheme is lying idle in large swathes of the country, for instance in Western, bereft of both technical personnel and maintenance.The SGR will be managed and maintained by the Chinese for at least a decade. Essentially, they will recover their money.As for the roads so far constructed, under construction and planned to be built, some of them are highways to nowhere in terms of economic value. A good example is the Madaraka Day announcement that the Thika Superhighway will be extended to Nanyuki, Nyeri and Isiolo.This is a misplaced priority, considering the fact that the Mombasa-Malaba highway (part of the Trans-Africa Highway) should have priority for expansion.We recommend that Jubilee and, or NASA, if they win on August 8, reviews all infrastructure projects and prioritises quick and high economic value.The medical equipment scheme too should be reviewed with an eye on technologists to operate the state-of-the-art apparatus as well as repair and maintain it.
