Meru Governor Peter Munya (pictured) has asked President Uhuru Kenyatta not to endorse Senator Kiraitu Murungi for governor. &ldquo;You know Meru has no problems of reelecting Uhuru, but let him stop endorsing or accompanying people, because this will cause voter apathy,&rdquo; he said. Munya spoke at Mikinduri Primary School on Thursday. Kiraitu will run for Meru governor on the Jubilee Party ticket.
