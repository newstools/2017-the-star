Police have arrested six supporters of Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto and confiscated a truck for allegedly breaching the electoral laws.The six men included a driver of a Chama Cha Mashinani party vehicle. They are accused of creating a disturbance by moving around at night to popularise the party, which according to Bomet police boss Samson Rukunga is an electoral offence.&ldquo;We have been trailing them for a while now. They have been moving around daily at odd hours and playing loud music, which is against the electoral regulations,&rdquo; he said.Rukunga said his officers arrested the individuals in Bomet town at 8pm on Saturday.He said the time was beyond the stipulated campaign hours. But Rutto has denied claims that the vehicle has been moving around the streets in town and playing loud music.He said this was an excuse to impound the vehicle.&ldquo;The truck was in fact parked when it was impounded. It had developed mechanical problems while at a function in Mismis, Chepalungu, and it had to be fixed at that time of the night in readiness for next day&rsquo;s events,&rdquo; communication director in the office of the governor Vitalis Kimutai said. &ldquo;All the amplifiers mounted on that truck are not working and anyone who wants to confirm can go test because even a technician who was working on it was arrested.&rdquo;Rukunga, however, maintained the vehicle has always been operating in town in violation of the rules governing the election as agreed by every politician and the electoral agency.&ldquo;We have every right to take action on anyone going against the law. We cannot allow such things to continue happening, because it is not only a breach of law but also a threat to security,&rdquo; he said.Rukunga said the six will be taken to court tomorrow.Reached for a comment, county IEBC election manager William Ndungu urged the candidates to follow the law during this electioneering period.&ldquo;The law will be applied equally, because they all signed and agreed to abide by the Electoral Code, as to the time when campaigns start and end,&rdquo; he said.
