Independent presidential candidate Joseph Nyagah has told off critics who say the State House race will be between JP&rsquo;s Uhuru Kenyatta and NASA&rsquo;s Raila Odinga.He said his name means &ldquo;ostrich&rdquo;, which runs fast and said he will shock Uhuru and Raila when the results are announced after the August 8 polls. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an ostrich and will run faster than Uhuru and Raila and win. I will be the fifth President of the Republic of Kenya,&rdquo; Nyagah said.He spoke when he met more than 100 clerics from Kirinyaga county at a Kagio hotel on Thursday evening.The aspirant said unlike his competitors, he and his family are clean.Nyagah said Deputy President William Ruto is the problem in Uhuru&rsquo;s government, claiming he enriches himself at any chance and cannot be trusted with the presidency. &ldquo;Jubilee Party has not delivered in the four years it has been in power. I will emulate former President Mwai Kibaki who brought development to this country,&rdquo; he said.Nyagah said he will not launch a manifesto, saying his agenda is to make sure Wanjiku&rsquo;s problems are solved. &ldquo;We have problems because of cartels that act as brokers and inflate government tenders. Once I win, my government will not have such people and tenders will be aboveboard,&rdquo; he saidNyagah reiterated he will form an all-inclusive government that will reflect the face of Kenya.He promised to pick a Cabinet Secretary from the Ogiek community.Nyagah was accompanied by Isiolo senator hopeful Kia Hassan Baraka.Also present was his political strategist Magerer Langat, a former ODM executive director.His running mate from Bungoma county, Moses Morango, criticised NASA for seeking the cancellation of the ballot paper printing tender awarded to Dubai-based firm Al Ghurair Printing &amp; Publishing Ltd. He said the timeline for the IEBC to conduct polls is running out and the election date cannot be changed, unless a referendum is conducted before the August 8.Morango said NASA wants the election to be postponed, since &ldquo;they are not ready.. Nyagah will face seven other candidates in the race to State House in August.
