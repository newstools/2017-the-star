A Meru governor aspirant yesterday bowed out of the race in favour of incumbent Peter Munya.Mwenda Mbijiwe, who was running on the ODM ticket, said he failed to get the party&rsquo;s nomination certificate in time to run for the seat.He addressed a press conference at the Three Steers hotel in Meru.Mbijiwe said Meru is solidly behind NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga but in 2022 he will support a Meru candidate.Asked why he is backing Munya and not Senator Kiraitu Murungi, Mbijiwe said the senator should retire because he has been in politics for too long. He said Munya&rsquo;s political wave is unstoppable and his 2022 presidency bid puts him at the helm in the August polls.&ldquo;I will move around the county campaigning for Munya as I would have campaigned for myself. I would not have left my supporters orphaned. Munya is a likeminded leader,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Kiraitu should prepare to retire to his home in Murungurune and leave his seat for youthful people. He should have gone for the presidency like his agemates Raila Odinga and Kalonzo Musyoka instead of staying home disturbing budding politicians.&rdquo; Mbijiwe quit Jubilee before primaries, fearing they would not be fair. &rdquo;I urge my supporters to elect Munya,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Meru has been used like a donkey carrying nappier grass for cows &mdash; then they are left without anything.&rdquo;
