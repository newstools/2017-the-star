French Open champion Rafa Nadal has withdrawn from next week&rsquo;s Aegon Championships at The Queen&rsquo;s Club after advice from his doctors to rest, organisers have announced.&ldquo;I am very sorry to say that I am not going to be able play Queen&rsquo;s next week. I am sad to make this decision because I love Queen&rsquo;s, I won the tournament in 2008 and every time I reached the Wimbledon final it was after playing Queen&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Nadal.The Spanish world number two is back to his best after being hampered by injuries in recent years and claimed a 10th Roland Garros crown on Sunday after winning titles in Monte Carlo, Barcelona and Madrid over the past two months.&ldquo;I was hoping to take some days off and then be ready, but at 31, and after a long claycourt season with all of the emotions of Roland Garros, and after speaking to my team and doctor, I have decided my body needs to rest if I am going to be ready to play Wimbledon.&rdquo;The Aegon Championships will feature world number one and defending champion Andy Murray, U.S. Open champion Stan Wawrinka, 2014 winner Grigor Dimitrov, and last year&rsquo;s runner-up Milos Raonic.
