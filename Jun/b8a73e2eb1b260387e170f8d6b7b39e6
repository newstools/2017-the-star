Mt Elgon residents have been assured of clean water, if they vote out the current administration.UDP&rsquo;s Peter Sirai said certain areas in the constituency did not have access to clean water, although the area is a water tower.Speaking in Toywondet, Kapkateny ward, Sirai said many residents in far-flung areas have to travel long distances to access the commodity.&ldquo;We know our people are suffering as they travel long distances to fetch water from rivers. We need to have a way of getting this water closer to the people and we need to use that through allocating some funds from the CDF kitty,&rdquo; he said.Sirai said his previous experience in the water sector in Nairobi is enough to help him secure water for the people in Mt Elgon.&ldquo;We have proper natural resources and we do not need to see our people suffer. We also supply other areas beyond Mt Elgon with water and we need to conserve and preserve these resources so that it is enough for all of us,&rdquo; he said.He said that the area was home to the Sabaots, Bukusus and Tesos who have been living together peacefully for years and should not fight because of elections.&ldquo;We have been living peacefully in this area for years and we should not allow politics to make us fight. We should rise above that by being peacefully now and beyond,&rdquo; he said.
