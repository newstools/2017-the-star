Lamu woman representative Shakilla Abdalla has dismissed as wrongly timed the recent announcement by Coast regional coordinator Nelson Marwa that the county is a violence hotspot.Other counties listed are Tana River and Kilifi.Abdalla said the announcement was unnecessary, adding that security officers should focus on ensuring order, instead of making unwarranted comments that might disturb the peace of the region.The Wiper candidate, who is defending her seat, wants residents protected against any individuals who migth be hell-bent on causing chaos.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the duty of the government to stamp out any possible causative factors that could lead to violence during and after the election to ensure peace,&rdquo; Abdalla said.
