Budalang'i MP Ababu Namwamba was booed off the stage by constituents during a tour with President Uhuru Kenyatta in Busia on Tuesday.Ababu was invited to address supporters by Uhuru but the crowd shouted him down."Kwa sababu hatuna muda, safari bado ni refu ... na n aona Ababu amefika hapa apate nafasi ya kuwasalimu ..."&nbsp;Uhuru said. Loosely translates to: "Because we don't have much time and we have a long way to go ... and I see Ababu is also present ... let him get a chance to address you."But the crowd jeered and started shouting, accusing the MP of associating with the Jubilee administration. Others claimed Ababu lacked godwill of residents in Busia county.With the noises and booing that continued to rent the air, Uhuru who was trying to calm the crowd was forced to intervene."... hehehehe... haya basi, hiyo ni haki yenu... sawa sawa ..." he concluded. (All right ... it's your right.) Ababu decided to back Uhuru after he ditched ODM and formed his labour party. He accused Opposition leaders of practising politics of dishonesty, insincerity, and mistrust.
