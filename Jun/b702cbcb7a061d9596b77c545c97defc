Transport on the busy Jogoo Road was disrupted for more than five hours yesterday after St Anne&rsquo;s Primary School pupils barricaded it, protesting against the knocking down the crossing guard.Parents and the school principal were with the pupils.They said a bus belonging to Embassava Sacco knocked and injured Martin Luganji at 6.30am on Tuesday as he led them across the road.&ldquo;The bus was speeding and the driver ignored the sign that was lifted to let us pass,&rdquo; a pupil said.The learners sat on the road, chanting, &ldquo;We want justice for our colleagues. No bump, no learning&rdquo;, forcing motorists to look for alternative routes.Principal Mary Cheruiyot said accidents have been rampant on the road.&ldquo;We cannot keep quiet as our children are knocked [down] every day. We want a permanent solution to this problem,&rdquo; she said.The road was reopened at 1pm, following the intervention of Governor Evans Kidero.He ordered the county Transport department to immediately erect bumps on the section of the road to prevent more accidents.&ldquo;We are going to have a crossover here but now I want a bump erected before 2pm. Our children have been out of classrooms since morning because of the negligence of a few people. That is unacceptable,&rdquo; he said.He said the county will pass a by-law that all PSV drivers undergo eye testing every year to ensure safety on the roads.Education CS Fred Matiang'i, who also visited the school, said that was the first incident.He urged the Transport department to move with speed to address the problem &ldquo;We also have a school in the North Rift that had the same problem. So we are going to talk to our colleagues in the Transport department so that this problem can be solved once and for all,&rdquo; Matiang'i said.
