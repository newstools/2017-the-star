Leveraging on technology has become a &ldquo;key pillar of banking strategy&rdquo; after last September&rsquo;s interest cap which pushed lenders to re-assess their processes and business models, consultants at PricewaterhouseCoopers say.Kenya Bankers Association last Friday officially launched an inter-bank mobile cash transfer platform, Pesalink, through its financial technology (Fintech) arm Integrated Payment Services. KCB and CBA have mobile money platforms through partnership with Safaricom, while Equity Bank has own Fintech subsidiary under Equitel brand.&ldquo;As financial institutions work ever more closely with innovators, consumers will begin to feel the benefits,&rdquo; PwC&rsquo;s financial services leader for East Africa Richard Njoroge said. &ldquo; The costs and frustrations customers often encounter when interacting with their bank, insurer or fund manager will hopefully begin to subside as they feel the benefit of streamlined, efficient businesses producing more tailored, customer centric products.&rdquo;PwC analysts said while majority of global banks, insurers and investment managers intend to increase partnerships with Fintech companies in three to five years, Kenyan insurance industry lags.The partnerships are expected to yield an average return on investment of 20 per cent on innovation projects, according to the PwC&rsquo;s report, Redrawing the lines: FinTech&rsquo;s growing influence on Financial Services, released last week. About 1,300 firms which are &ldquo;getting to grips with innovations&rdquo; participated in the global survey. &ldquo;One driving factor behind these partnerships is an increasing fear within the industry that revenue is at risk of being lost to standalone Fintechs, with 88 per cent of financial services respondents seeing it as a real threat. On average, up to 24 per cent of revenue is thought to be at risk,&rdquo; the report states.
