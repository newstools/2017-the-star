Embu governor aspirant Leonard Muriuki (Narc Kenya) has promised to subsidise the cost of boda boda insurance covers, and water for domestic use and irrigation.He spoke yesterday in Embu North when he and his running mate Sylvester Gakumu met boda boda operators.The bitter boda boda operators said Kairuri residents suffer unbearable high costs of water.They said although they have piped water, they pay too much for it and that eats into their farming profit.The operators said residents of Embu East and North pay between Sh500 and Sh1,000 a month for the water, yet the water is not always available.They said they will only elect a candidate who will assure them that he will reduce the water costs to a level they can afford.Muriuki said the county government has enough money to subsidise the water prices.He said it is possible for the county government to charge a maintenance fee of Sh200 per month.
