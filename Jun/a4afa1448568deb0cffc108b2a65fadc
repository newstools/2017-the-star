Arsenal have told Alexis Sanchez they will not cave in to his attempts to engineer a move to a Premier League rival this summer.The Gunners remain determined to secure the Chile star on a new long-term contract but will be forced to sell their star player if he refuses to sign.Sanchez's representatives have explored moves to Manchester City and Chelsea in recent weeks.But Arsenal are adamant they will not entertain any offers from English clubs regardless of whether or not he signs a new contract.That leaves Bayern Munich or Juventus as the South American's most realistic escape routes if he leaves the Emirates this summer.City and Chelsea are both willing to pay in excess of &pound;45million for Sanchez.But Arsenal are not interested in strengthening one of their direct rivals. Despite the season having drawn to a close Sanchez is still showing himself to be in fine form, providing a vital assist in Chile's recent 1-1 draw with Russia.The Arsenal man came on as a substitute in the game and, with his first meaningful contribution, sent Mauricio Isla through on goal.Arsenal are hoping to tie up Sanchez's future sooner rather than later before they can press ahead with transfer intent of their own.
