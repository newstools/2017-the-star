The Commission on Revenue Allocation yesterday warned of serious consequences if the Senate and the National Assembly fail to compromise on county funds.They are stalemated over the Division of Revenue Bill.CRA chairperson Jane Kiringai, vice chairman Humphrey Wattaga and CEO George Ooko urged legislators to negotiate and reach consensus on the amount proposed by Senate and Treasury.She addressed a press conference at their offices in Nairobi. The Senate wants the county governments to be given Sh314 billion equitable share, while the Treasury proposed Sh299 billion.The National Assembly, however, slashed it to Sh291 billion.&ldquo;Both Houses of Parliament should reconsider their hard positions and negotiate a mediated allocation to the counties that lies between the National Treasury recommendation and the Senate provision. This will pave way for the enactment of the County Allocation of Revenue Bill, 2017,&rdquo; Karingai said.She said since the commission recommended Sh323 billion for the counties in September last year, revenue has been sharply limited.Kiringai cited the drop in total collections and severe drought that has affected the country, requiring relief food. Rains have been inadequate and the drought is expected to continue.
