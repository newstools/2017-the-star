The Teachers Service Commission is seeking to hire 5,000 additional teachers in primary and post-primary institutions, chief executive officer Nancy Macharia has said. This will be an addition to the 10,000 vacancies the commission advertised in March this year as it sought to hire principals, headmasters and deputies in primary, secondary and tertiary institutions. In a statement yesterday, Macharia said 2,205 slots are open for primary school teachers, while 2,795 are open for tutors in post-primary institutions. Applicants for posts in primary schools must have minimum qualification of a P1 certificate, while those seeking vacancies in post-primary institutions must have a minimum of a Diploma in Education Certificate. “Successful candidates will be deployed to serve in stations in any part of the country and not necessarily in the county where they were recruited,” Macharia said. Applications for primary posts should be addressed to TSC county directors, while applications for vacancies in post-primary Institutions should be addressed to secretaries of boards of management of respective institutions. “A copy should also be sent to TCS county director on or before June 14, 2017,” Macharia said. Applicants are advised to visit the TSC website at www.tsc.go.ke for detailed information on the available vacancies. Those who had previously applied but were unsuccessful must apply afresh “since a new merit list for the 2017-18 financial year will be generated”.
