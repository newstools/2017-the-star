The opening batsman scored 17 runs before retiring with hurt.His knock alongside Daniel Sabwa&rsquo;s 19 helped his side to 81 runs in the allotted 10 overs. The two had put on an opening stand of 31 runs before they all retired hurt.Frenke continued with his performance with the ball when he later went on to pick 3 for 10 in an over to help his side in bowling out the Simbas for 32 in just six overs.Frenke&rsquo;s bowling and Samson Wafula&rsquo;s 2 for 3 was so fierce that none of the Simba&rsquo;s batsmen managed to get the double figure in an inning that included five ducks. James Kamote&rsquo;s and Fred Omwega&rsquo;s top score of 16 for Kifaru was canceled by David Mutua&rsquo;s 19 runs which led Swara to seven wickets win with eight balls to go.
