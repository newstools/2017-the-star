Celebrated city pastors Allan and Kathy Kiuna's son Jeremy is off the market. The young lad is enjoying the warmth of a sexy woman by the name Shamein Joy. Jeremy Kiuna likes to keep away from the limelight. That's why little is known about him. Jeremy, who is a DJ, singer and rapper, at least according to his social media account, is deeply in love with his girlfriend, and the young lovebirds are never afraid of showing off their affection in public. Wanapendana kama chanda na pete. In a mooshy wooshy Instagram post, Jeremy wrote, "Why does she make me miss her more #myâ¤ï¸ LOVE YOU and happy three years now YOU ARE AMAZING IN EVERY WAY since we missed anniversary together I wanted to post this for #MyQueen."
