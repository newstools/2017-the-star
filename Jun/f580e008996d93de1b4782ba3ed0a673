Khayega sports ground is set for a major face-lift, according to Kakamega County governor Wycliffe Ambetsa Oparanya. Addressing a capacity crowd after inspecting the ground, Oparanya said he is shocked with the encroachment on the playing field by private developers.&ldquo;My aim is to restore and save Khayega social ground from the hands of the greedy grabbers. I will send surveyors from my office to check the field and give a report before we commence with the construction of the ground.&ldquo;This is one of the historic grounds around that has produced the top football stars not only in the region but in the country,&rdquo; Oparanya stated. He warned that any private developer found to have encroached on ground should prepare to face full force of law. He said through his ministry of sports together with other stakeholders, they will work out right structures that will enhance nurturing and development of sports activity in the county. Some of the best stars who came through Khayega ground include the late Anthony Mukabwa, Elijah Lidonde, Nick Yakhama, Washington Muhanji, Reginald Asibwa, Bonface Ambani, Gerson Likono and Collins Shivachi among others.
