Mandera politicians aligned with the Economic Freedom Party who have endorsed President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s reelection have threatened to review their relationship with the ruling party.This follows recent disclosure that about 50,000 names were found missing in the voter register.The politicians include Senator Billow Kerrow, governor aspirant Hassan Noor and senator aspirant Hassan Osman. They said they read a sinister motive in the missing names.Kerrow, Noor and Osman risk missing out on voting if the matter is not resolved.The politicians accuse IEBC officials of colluding with their opponents in the race to confuse the electorate.Kerrow said the missing names have affected all the six constituencies in the county. He called for a quick correction of the anomalies.Osman said, &ldquo;The electoral agency is hellbent on ensuring our supporters do not vote. Matters to do with the register are not to be taken lightly. We have moved to court seeking an explanation from the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission.&rdquo;Noor urged supporters to remain calm and make sure peace is maintained as the court makes a ruling on the matter. &ldquo;I am sure IEBC commissioners are clever enough, and they want the elections to be done in a fair manner,&rdquo; he said.The Council of Elders picked Noor, a former Rift Valley provincial commissioner, to run against incumbent Governor Ali Roba (Jubilee) who is defending his seat.During the 2013 General Election, Hassan voted in Lang&rsquo;ata constituency, Nairobi, but transferred to Mandera North, Ramu ward, after declaring an interest to unseat Governor Roba.
