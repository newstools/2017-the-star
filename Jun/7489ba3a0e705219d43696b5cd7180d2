Ever noticed that the way we tell stories is different from the way, say someone from the West, would tell the same story? I&rsquo;ll set the scene.It&rsquo;s a Tuesday morning, an open plan office, and in strolls Jack. He walks right up to his desk, stops, and remains standing. Slowly, his best friend in the office, seated at the adjoining desk, looks up at him, wondering why Jack is just standing there.&lsquo;Chief!&rsquo; says Jack, with emphasis, and immediately, his friend knows he&rsquo;s in for a good story.&lsquo;What?&rsquo; says the friend.&lsquo;Drama, drama,&rsquo; says Jack. He rubs his hands together and begins the story. &lsquo;So yesterday I&rsquo;m asleep, ngorotaa-ing. And then Waaa! Yelling and screaming in the neighbourhood wakes me up&hellip;&rsquo;&lsquo;Aa!&rsquo; the friend says. &lsquo;Thieves?&rsquo;&lsquo;I thought so,&rsquo; says Jack. &lsquo;Even wife was like, &ldquo;Thieves?&rdquo; I told her I&rsquo;ll go check. I got out of bed, put on gown, grabbed the rungu.&rsquo; As Jack says this, he acts out the scene right there in the office, putting on an imaginary sleeping gown and grabbing an imaginary rungu as he&rsquo;s talking.&lsquo;I went downstairs, Waaap!&rsquo; Jack continues, adding a sound effect to show how fast he took the stairs.&lsquo;Eheh,&rsquo; his friend prompts, totally engrossed.&lsquo;I get outside,&rsquo; says Jack, &lsquo;I find my next-door neighbour just standing there, chilled, looking in the direction the noise is coming from. I&rsquo;m like, alaa, kwani?&rsquo;&lsquo;It wasn&rsquo;t thieves?&rsquo; asks Jack&rsquo;s office friend, puzzled.&lsquo;Nooo,&rsquo; says Jack. &lsquo;Neighbour tells me ati Mr Kamau&hellip; Kamau is another neighbour,&rsquo; Jack explains, &lsquo;Ati Kamau got home and wife is in bed with another man&hellip; Chaos!&rsquo; &lsquo;What,&rsquo; says Jack&rsquo;s friend, astonished.&lsquo;And do you know who the guy in bed is?&rsquo; says Jack. &lsquo;Another neighbour.&rsquo;&lsquo;Wacha,&rsquo; says Jack&rsquo;s friend.&lsquo;Yaani, drama,&rsquo; is all Jack can say. And then they both laugh, before turning their attention to work.If this story had been told in the West, it would have been a straightforward recounting of the facts. No sound effects, no action-packed scenes, just a 30-second report.I have a theory as to why our everyday stories are so full of colour, imagery, and sound. It has to do with the tradition of African storytelling, our culture of oral traditions, where the storyteller paints a picture for the audience with gestures, body movement and tone of voice. It is a performance that brings liveliness to any story. It&rsquo;s our way, and it&rsquo;s better.What got me thinking about all of this is my concern at the way we compare ourselves with other places. How many times have we heard Nairobi being compared to Dubai, Singapore or New York? Or that Nairobi should do this, that, or the other because that&rsquo;s how they do it in Amsterdam, London or Riyadh? Why compare? We&rsquo;re not any of these other cities, and there&rsquo;s nowhere it says we can&rsquo;t be just as well-managed, clean and orderly as all those better cities by doing it our way.You can pick a good idea from here and there, then tweak it to make it fit you. Or better yet, come up with your own ideas but don&rsquo;t aspire to be like someone else. We tell stories better because it&rsquo;s our way. Let&rsquo;s now start thinking less about being like, and think more about being better our way; working with what we have, and with who we are.
