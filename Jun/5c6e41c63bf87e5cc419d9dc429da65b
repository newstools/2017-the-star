Police in
Kilifi are investigating the alleged kidnapping of a Ganze MP aspirant. Anderson
Kenga, who is seeking the seat on the Kanu ticket, was
allegedly kidnapped in Mtwapa on Sunday night. He was later
found unconscious in his car at Jumba la mtwana ruins in Mtwapa. The aspirant said he lost personal items,
including phones, ID and ATM cards. On
Tuesday, Kenga said he had joined fellow politicians at a club in Mtwapa. “I
walked into the restaurant and met several political colleagues who were having
dinner. There were two women I found at the table. When I
ordered food, the waiter said that my colleagues had already ordered boiled goat meat for all of us,” he said. Kenga said after dinner and drinks he engaged the two women in a discussion,
before leaving with them to another joint with another candidate for Kilifi North MP. “It
was around 11pm and we moved out of the hotel to another joint in Mtwapa
town. After several drinks, my colleague left and I also decided to move, but
one of the women offered to drive the car claiming I was drunk,” he said. Kenga said one of the women gave him water to drink and he fell
asleep. “I
was awakened by villagers who knew me near Jumba ruins at around 2am. I did
not know where I was and how I arrived there,” he said. Kenga said he reported the matter to Kilifi DCI. “I
have managed to block all my ATM cards, my phone lines and I have left everything to police to investigate,” he said.
