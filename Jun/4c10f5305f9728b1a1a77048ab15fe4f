President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto today will tour Kericho county as primary election losers urge them to support independents.Independents can hurt Jubilee&rsquo;s chances in the Rift Valley and elsewhere and the party wants them to shelve their ambitions. Four Kericho MPs have urged Uhuru to allow them to defend their seats as independents, after they lost in the JP primaries. Eric Keter (Belgut), Benjamin Lang&rsquo;at (Ainamoi), Jackson Rop (Kipkelion West) and Leonard Sang (Bureti) claimed they lost unfairly.Uhuru and Ruto will go to Bomet tomorrow. Kericho Governor Paul Chepkwony and county commissioner Muktar Abdi will receive them.Uhuru and Ruto are expected to start their tour from Londiani town in Kipkelion East, where area MP Joseph Limo and other Jubilee leaders are expected to address residents.They will make stopovers in Barsiele, Lesirwo, Fort Ternan market in Kipkelion West. The duo will then head to Kipsitet market in Sigowet/Soin constituency where area MP Justice Kemei will join them for a rally.Last week independents said they do not support calls by some JP leaders that they should back those who won in the primaries. &ldquo;We lost unfairly to those who were given the JP ticket. This will be proved if Kericho voters are allowed to decide on their leaders,&rdquo; Lang&rsquo;at said.He said independents will back Uhuru&rsquo;s reelection. &ldquo;Those who think we are in the opposition are misguided. It will not be smooth sailing for them. We support the government more than they do,&rdquo; he saidLangat, Keter, Rop and Sang told Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter and his Kapseret counterpart Oscar Sudi to keep off Kericho politics. They termed the North Rift politicians, who visited Kericho last week, &ldquo;hypocrites and political tourists&rdquo;. Lang&rsquo;at and Keter said Sudi and Alfred Keter have no courtesy, integrity or the moral authority to tell Kericho people whom to elect.
