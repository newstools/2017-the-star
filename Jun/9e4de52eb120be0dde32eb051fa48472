Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua cut short her speech on Saturday in Ngariama in her Gichugu backyard after the crowd heckled her.The Kirinyaga governor aspirant was with her running mate Joseph Gitari.Trouble started when Karua said JP nominee Anne Waiguru is corrupt and should not be voted for.The crowd started chanting pro-Waiguru slogans and told off Karua, saying she was an area MP for two decades but has nothing to show for it.&ldquo;Tunataka minji minji, hukufanya maendeleo ukiwa MP (We want &lsquo;the yellow yellow lady&rsquo;; you didn&rsquo;t develop the area when you were MP),&rdquo; they shouted, in reference to Waiguru&rsquo;s nickname.Minji is the Kikuyu word for peas and is now being used as slang to refer to a light-skinned woman, likened to yellow-coloured peas.Another resident shouted from the crowd, &ldquo;You resigned as Justice minister after you had promised us you would lobby for the construction of Kianyaga-Kithure road, but that did not happen!&rdquo;The rowdy crowd asked politicians in the area to articulate their development agenda instead of name calling and attacking personalities.
