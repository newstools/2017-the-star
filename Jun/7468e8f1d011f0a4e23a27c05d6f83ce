Kiambu Jubilee Party governor candidate Ferdinand Waititu, also known as Baba Yao, was yesterday cleared by the IEBC to run amid claims he has integrity issues.A report &ndash; RedCard20 - named Baba Yao as one of the contestants who should be blocked from occupying a public office because he has not passed integrity test.The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights moved to the Supreme Court to seek interpretation of Chapter Six of the Constitution which bars those with questionable integrity from standing for election.Baba Yao said the push to have him locked out of the race is the work of his political detractors hell bent on tarnishing his name.The Kikuyu MP spoke after he was handed a certificate of clearance.&ldquo;As you can see I have been cleared to run for Kiambu governor. I am as clean as cotton,&rdquo; Baba Yao said.He said he expected his competitors to pull something on him, but was prepared to defend himself and knew the Kiambu people would rally behind him.&ldquo;The Kiambu people know the kind of person I am and I was expecting my competitors to throw mud at me. That did not stop me from being cleared,&rdquo; Baba Yao said.He, however, said his priority is to deliver the 1.2 million votes in Kiambu for President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto. Baba Yao said he will go door-to-door to mobilise voters to turn out in large numbers to deliver victory for Uhuru on August 8. &ldquo;My team, United for Kiambu, who include my running mate James Nyoro, Rev David Gakuyo, Acquiline Njoki and John Mugwe will mobilise the Kiambu people to come out and exercise their right to vote for the leaders they want, and more so seek votes for our President and his deputy,&rdquo; Baba Yao said.Baba Yao said if elected as Kiambu governor he will ensure traders in open air markets are not charged any fee. He says he will make sure building construction costs will come down, and the county budget is people-driven. &ldquo;I will make sure there is public participation, and development in the county will be done according to the people&rsquo;s wishes,&rdquo; Baba Yao said. He said he will maintain and preach peace throughout the campaign period and urged his opponents to do the same.
