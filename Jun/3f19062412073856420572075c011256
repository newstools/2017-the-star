The Health ministry has said it will revamp Kenya&rsquo;s under-equipped emergency care.Speaking during the inaugural emergency care symposium held at Safari Park Hotel yesterday, CS Cleopa Mailu said the development of policy on emergency medical care, which is in its final stages, will go a long way in improving healthcare.The policy seeks to establish a working emergency medical care system that will improve access, delivery and funding of emergency care.It will ensure Kenya has the highest attainable standard of emergency care.The policy will also ensure recognition of emergency service as an integrated component of the healthcare, coordination of all emergency medical service providers and creation of an authority to regulate emergency care.Mailu said lack of proper coordination care providers, inadequate number of skilled providers, lack of funding and lack of standardised curricula have undermined care.The National Hospital Insurance Fund, represented by Ambrose Lugho, said Kenya&rsquo;s healthcare system is plagued by lack of resources.&ldquo;Many county hospitals lack well-equipped trauma centres and have inadequate staff trained on emergency care,&rdquo; Lugho said.&ldquo;Marsabit, for instance, is the largest county and on average it costs a family Sh15,000 to transport a sick member to a hospital.&rdquo;He added that to achieve universal healthcare coverage, the NHIF has expanded its benefit package to strengthen effective care management and develop a referral system.&ldquo;NHIF has rolled out an emergency road services package in which the Kenya Red Cross has been contracted to offer ambulatory services to all fully paid-up scheme beneficiaries countrywide,&rdquo; Lugho said.&ldquo;In addition, we have enrolled 6.5 million principal members, making the total population covered to about 25 million.&rdquo;In 2015, the Fund expanded its benefit package to include inpatient cover, outpatient cover, maternity cover for both normal and caesarean section deliveries, imaging services, CT-scan, MRI and renal dialysis care.NHIF recently introduced a surgical package for minor, major and specialised cases, including kidney transplants. It also introduced radiology and chemotherapy treatment.According to the National Transport and Safety Authority estimates, there are 900,000 motorcyclists in the country.This poses a serious threat to provision of emergency care as they easily jam roads. For instance, last year, 2,965 deaths occurred on Kenyan roads.
