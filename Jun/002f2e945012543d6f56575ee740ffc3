A family in Kitale lost property estimated to be worth Sh3 million after a fire broke up in their furniture yard on Monday. Mwashi Jacob, the owner of the Kiboswa Furniture store, said he suspects the fire was sparked by a cigarette smoker. "Somebody passed by my yard smoking. We suspect he threw a cigarette stub which was fanned by the wind." "The fire spread so rapidly that we could not save anything," Mwashi said adding that he lost equipment and customer's goods in the inferno. He applauded the Trans Nzoia firefighters for the swift response to contain the fire. The team worked with residents. Mwashi's wife said the family had just lost a close family and was raising funds to clear a Sh2 million hospital bill. John Sifuna, a witness, said bodaboda riders secured a petroleum tanker that was parked outside the yard. "When we saw the tanker parked outside the premises, we sensed danger. Together with other youths, we pushed the lorry away from the yard." The truck's driver was not around the premises at the time the fire erupted. Sifuna called on the county government to employ young and energetic youths who can handle such critical jobs. Trans Nzoia county government recently procured two fire fighting engines.
