Kisumu county commissioner Maalim Mohammed has begun a series of peace meetings ahead of the August 8 General Election.He warned that acts of lawlessness will not be condoned, assuring residents that peace will prevail throughout the campaign period.&ldquo;Kisumu will remain peaceful. Even though we had shambolic nominations across the country, in Kisumu no life was lost and no property was destroyed despite heightened emotions in the county. And that is a great achievement for the people of Kisumu,&rdquo; Mohammed said.&ldquo;Kisumu is perceived to be a violence-prone area, especially after a General Election. When I was brought to Kisumu as a commissioner, I said I wanted to leave a legacy by ensuring that peace will prevail.&rdquo; Mohammed spoke at County Hall yesterday during a peace forum. The meeting was attended by NCIC representatives, Kisumu security team, deputy county commissioner, county commander, Mercy Corps, Champion Of Peace, Jamii Dhabiti, Pamoja group, business representative, Matatu Owners Association, Red Cross county youth, county boda boda and youths with disability.&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t allow any more loss of lives or destruction of property within this county. I am assuring the business people. We are well prepared and well equipped to ensure security in this county,&rdquo; Mohammed said. &ldquo;Chaos start when politicians attend meetings of their rivals without invitation. Stop that. All aspirants should comply with the IEBC rules.The meetings start between 7am-6pm. Beyond that we won&rsquo;t take any responsibility, and we will treat it as an insecurity issue.&rdquo; Mohammed urged candidates to preach peace.Bishop Joshua Okoto, who spoke on behalf of the clergy, said Kisumu is the hub of Nyanza, and there is need to address peace in the region.
