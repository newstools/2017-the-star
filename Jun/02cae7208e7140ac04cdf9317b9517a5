The planned President&rsquo;s campaign tour today in Kitui town appears to have excited many residents.Uhuru Kenyatta (pictured) will be launching projects carried out by the national government.Residents agree that most projects implemented by Uhuru&rsquo;s administration are of great benefit. During a tour of the projects by the Star yesterday, communities said they are happy with the Jubilee administration.At the Kitui School, the national government has built a Sh24 million administration block expected t be opened today.Principal Bernard Mutua said the institution is grateful to Jubilee administration for the project that started in 2016 after Uhuru visited the school. He said besides the construction of the administration block, the national government had distributed money for renovation.Jubilee has also ensured kidney patients enjoy free services offered at the Kitui Level 5 Hospital after the renal unit was set up.Kitui medical superintendent J N Muingai admitted that previously it was difficult for kidney patients to survive after being admitted. He said with the setting up of the renal unit, things have changed for the better and patients are no longer being referred to Kenyatta National Hospital.The Sh100 milion Inyuu Bridge in Kitui East subcounty is another project that the residents are enthusiastic about. In the past when it rained they were cut off from the rest of Kitui because they could not cross the River Thua.
