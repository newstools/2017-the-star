Jubilee losers in Uasin Gishu have threatened to withdraw support for party candidates, saying girlfriends and relatives are unfairly getting nominations. The 400 losers in Deputy President William Ruto’s backyard on Tuesday said they have been overlooked in nominations to Parliament. “We cannot accept a list that is full of mipango ya kando (girlfriends) and friends of some people, yet those of us who worked for the party and even paid nomination fees for the primaries have been left out,” spokesman Phillip Chebunet said. But party officials, led by county chairman Sammy Ruto, denied the claim and said the list has already been forwarded to the IEBC. “The nomination issue was given to party candidates to handle and we are through with that,” he said.  sidelined in campaigns But the losers said they will take steps to cancel the list. Chebunet said they will sue if the proposed names are not withdrawn and the list drawn afresh by all key leaders from the region. They asked President Uhuru Kenyatta and Ruto to intervene in the row. “If they don’t consider our grievances, then we will withdraw our support for party candidates and advise our supporters likewise,” Chebunet, who lost the race for Moiben MP, said. He was accompanied by Daniel Kemei, Nancy Chepsiya and Abraham Mutwol. Mutwol said they have been sidelined in presidential campaigns. He said during recent campaigns by Uhuru and Ruto in the county, all the losers were ignored. “... yet the President and his deputy had asked that we back the so-called Jubilee winners during the primaries. We will withdraw support because it’s like we are not needed,” Mutwol said.
