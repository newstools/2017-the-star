Exports of peas to the 28-member European Union will be subjected to fewer checks from next month, Fresh Produce Exporters Association of Kenya said yesterday. The lobby said EU has reduced the 10 per cent scrutiny on Kenyan beans to five per cent. The EU imposed a 10 per cent check on consignments of beans from Kenya with pods in late 2012, citing excess pesticide residues, but suspended this in 2015. FPEAK chair Apollo Owuor said local farmers need more training in good agricultural practices to reduce wastage through better handling of produce, post-harvest storage and transportation.
