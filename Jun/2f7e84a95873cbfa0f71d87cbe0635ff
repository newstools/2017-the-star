Six minors were yesterday charged before a Murang’a court with being members of an illegal group. They were arrested on Friday at Mukuyu market in Murang’a town after an uproar by residents that they were being terrorised by a gang. The six are suspected to be members of Gaza, a group known for causing terror to residents in some estates in Nairobi. The prosecution asked the court to deny the minors bond due to their alleged association with Gaza, saying they may interfere with witnesses. It also said they need more time to conduct a medical assessment on the suspects to establish their ages before they are formally charged. The six did not take plea. The magistrate ordered they be remanded at the Murang’a police station until June 21 when the case will be mentioned. The suspects’ parents were orderd to produce birth certificates in court.
