Meru Governor Peter Munya has rubbished claims that residents living around Kinoru Stadium will be relocated, and their land used to build a parking lot. He further denied allegations that those who will resist to move will be forced to pay higher land rates. The immediate former Council of Governors chairman said his opponents were against the construction of the stadium, and now that it is complete they are using malice to hoodwink the electorate. &ldquo;Senator Kiraitu Murungi himself said if the stadium is opened, the Meru people should not vote for him. Meru is today a sporting destination for this country, courtesy of Kinoru. Why should you vote for him?&rdquo; Munya said.&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t listen to propaganda perpetrated by my opponents who have no agenda. It is a Sh200 million project. This field is enough for parking and other sporting amenities. The land rates are annually passed by the county assembly and it has already been dissolved. No one will buy your land or increase land rates.&rdquo;Munya was addressing football fans and Imenti North youths at Kinoru Stadium on Monday where he gave Sh1.4 million to teams that won and who those participated in Governor Munya&rsquo;s Cup and Governor&rsquo;s business Challenge tournaments.
