The Nairobi government has pegged its hope on the Senate to recover Sh72 billion owed to it by the national government.The Senate has invited Governor Evans Kidero to appear before it on Thursday to provide information about the debt.This follows a petition by the county government, seeking the House&rsquo;s help to recover the debt, which has accumulated over time.&ldquo;The purpose of this letter is to invite you to come and present the issues concerning the settlement of the debt owed to the Nairobi City County government by the national government,&rdquo; reads the letter dated May 30 and signed by Senate Clerk Jeremiah Nyegenye.The governor will appear before the Finance and Budget committee on Thursday at 10am in County Hall.&ldquo;We further request that the said evidence/documentation that you may wish to present to the committee be forwarded to our offices before or on June 5, to enable the committee to acquaint itself with the information prior to the date of the meeting,&rdquo; the letter reads.The county says the debt arises from land rates and parking fees that have accumulated over the years, attracting huge interest and penalties.Kidero has on several occasions accused the national government of not showing commitment to settle the debt, adding that the county has been unable to meet some of its obligations because of the arrears.Last week, the governor blamed Senator Mike Sonko, now his rival for the city&rsquo;s top job, of not fighting for the county in the Senate to recover the debt.Figures released by county rates accountant Peter Murithii in April last year showed that Harambee House (the Office of the President), Harambee House Annex (the Office of the Deputy President) and Vigilance House are some of the national government bodies that owe the county a huge debt.Parliament owes City Hall Sh43 million, while the Department of Defence has not paid Sh30 million.The Parliamentary Service Commission, Vigilance House and the National Treasury owe City Hall Sh5.9 million, Sh3.2million and 5.2 million, respectively.The Kenya Broadcasting Corporation owed City Hall Sh2.2 billion, but paid Sh10 million when its premises on Harry Thuku Road was clamped in February.Other government premises on City Hall&rsquo;s &ldquo;list of shame&rdquo; are Jogoo House, Nyayo House, Sheria House and police stations.
