Kitui Senator David Musila, 74, said young people will run the show if he is elected governor.The senator on Thursday said he will not have &ldquo;elderly people&rdquo; managing his government as he will be the sole representative of the older generation. Musila, an independent, said although young people will manage county affairs, he will be a no-nonsense overseer who will crack the whip and sack non-performers. &ldquo;I will only act as a supervisor to monitor how they [youth] are managing and crack the whip on under-performers or even sack them. Essentially, the youth will be running the show, as well as women,&rdquo; he said.He urged the youth of Kitui to support his candidature, saying their ilk will be the beneficiaries of his government. Musila said it is foolhardy for anyone to campaign against him based on his age. &ldquo;I may be old but I&rsquo;ll be working with very young people. These are the people who are going to run this county,&rdquo; he said.Musila lost the Wiper primary to incumbent Julius Malombe.
