Survivors say 44 people have died of thirst after their truck broke down in the Sahara Desert in northern Niger, the Red Cross has told the BBC.The six survivors, all women, walked to a remote village and are being looked after in Dirkou, Niger, Red Cross official Lawal Taher said.They say several children are among the dead.The Ghanaians and Nigerians were trying to get to Libya, reports Nigerien news site Sahelien.So far no-one has visited the site to identify the bodies, Taher added.The unforgiving conditions of the Sahara Desert mean that a broken down vehicle is often a death sentence for migrants.Niger serves as a transit point for West Africans hoping to reach Europe to start a better life.Every year, tens of thousands of migrants cross the Sahara to reach Libya. From the Libyan coast they board rickety boats to ferry them to Europe.Many drown in the Mediterranean but, perhaps, less well known, are the dangers they face while crossing the Sahara.It's not known how many deaths there are every year - as it's a vast, ungoverned region. But many migrants die of thirst, while others are robbed and attacked by criminal gangs and security forces.
