For three years, residents of Boni forest in Lamu county have been facing a major education crisis after teachers fled attacks by al Shabaab.Security forces moved in full force to comb out the militia from the vast Boni forest, where they were hiding and launching attacks from. The Operation Linda Boni succeeded, but the education standards of residents, mainly the Aweir and the Boni, are still deteriorating.Teachers fearing attacks dared not resume work, as the area had been labelled a danger zone due to the terror gang that was ambushing villages and schools. The terrorists used to play &lsquo;hide-and-seek&rsquo; games with the security forces, constantly staging surprise attacks on convoys and even villages.For many times, those living in Boni forest would fall victim to both security forces and al Shabaab, forcing many residents to flee for safety in Kiunga, Mkokoni, Hindi, Lamu, Faza and Witu, among other areas.Government officials, including teachers, were not left behind, especially those that had been posted in the area from other regions.MPEKETONI ATTACKIt all started during the Mpeketoni terror attack that left more than 60 people dead, followed by a series of similar attacks in adjacent areas of Lamu county.Schools were closed indefinitely and pupils in upper classes transferred to Arid Primary School in Lamu, which is safe.Today, some of the schools are still closed. The buildings have been turned into security camps, depriving children of classrooms.Although the government declared the area safe and announced normal education had resumed, there are still problems on the ground.Some of those in upper classes who are on full sponsorship by the county cannot travel to Mokowe Lamu Arid Boarding School due to the high poverty levels, and often get to the learning institution late.I toured Kiangwe village in the Boni forest, which is home to the Boni community, who traditionally live in the forest.Kiangwe can be accessed by water or by road, but transport is still problematic since there are no public means.Those wishing to travel by road have to rely on security vehicles, as there is no public transport, while those travelling by ocean have to wait for a lift on a boat from the county, state, NGOs, fishermen or any well-wisher.At the village, I came across children, some in upper primary school, who said it was difficult to travel and could not even tell when they would go to school.One of the students says he is waiting for a lift from either a county government boat or any other boat that will come to Kiangwe to travel back to school.By then, one week had already gone.Many residents were visibly weak. Their dressing code, health status and even shelter said a lot about the agony they go through in life, both young and old.The community&rsquo;s major economic livelihood was producing honey from the forest, but due to security reasons, it is difficult for them to continue with their work.If it is for the community to change, then the only investment that can transform them is education.At the corner of the village is the public primary school on the north west. Security personnel are all over to ensure the officers are able to fight back in case of an attack any time of the day or night.Kiangwe Primary School&rsquo;s new headteacher Famau Ali travelled in the same boat from Lamu back to the school for the opening of the term, after a transfer from Bargoni Primary School, which is near Hindi.Famau says he accepted the transfer so as to help the young pupils, who had no means of accessing education. &ldquo;Our school is still serving as a security area. I came in January this year, the school had been closed for three years. Most of the teachers were advised to return but they refused,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said. Famau, who looks young with a bearded face, said the school has only two teachers against a population of 150 pupils.Due to the teacher shortage, Kiangwe Primary School has no ECD classes, and the pupils are taught only in nursery for one year.He says 86 of the pupils are in nursery and the rest are in class one to four. &ldquo;From standard five to eight, they normally go to Arid Zone School in Mokowe,&rdquo; he said.He said teachers don&rsquo;t want to come back, despite the assurance that the area is now safe.&ldquo;The teachers think al Shabaab is still around and they may be gunned down if they return,&rdquo; he said.Another problem is accessing fresh water. During drought, residents were drinking &lsquo;black-coloured water&rsquo;, which smelled badly.Famau says when the school was reopened, they requested the security personnel to give them four classrooms, as they had occupied all the classes for their operations.The young children are used to the heavy security presence, but it has proven hard to teach them in such an environment.&ldquo;Professionally I cannot teach and at the same time the school acts as a security camp,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.The head teacher said they are doing their best without fear to ensure the children get their right to education like others in the safe zones.&ldquo;During the attacks, al Shabaab said they did not want to see any teacher teaching the formal education; only Arabic and Islamic religious education,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.NOT TRAINED ON LAPTOP USELamu Governor Issa Timamy brought laptops for standard one pupils and others for the teachers.The laptops were donated by the national government and are part of the promises it made during campaigns for the 2013 general election.The headteacher and the pupils were happy to receive the digital gadgets. However, it emerged that even the teachers have not been trained on how to use them.The school has solar power and it will be easier for them to charge the laptops.&ldquo;We are supposed to go for training in Lamu so that we get the knowhow of using these laptops. As for now, no one can use them for teaching.&rdquo;Famau says it&rsquo;s not only the digital world that is proving tough for the poor pupils in the remote villages of Boni forest but analogue learning is still a major hurdle.&ldquo;Most teachers in schools within the Boni forest have no technical knowhow about the facilities. We hope inshallah we shall make use of them,&rdquo; he said.His thanked President Uhuru Kenyatta and said: &ldquo;We need more support from the government.&rdquo; The headteacher said culture has also lowered education standards in the village, as girls are forced to undergo female genital mutilation before being married off to elderly men at a tender age.Young boys, he said, have been hurt by drug abuse, adding that its common to see youths chewing miraa in the village. Kiangwe is not only the village that was affected by the terrorist gang and the ongoing Operation Linda Boni.Others are Mangai, Basuba, mararani, Pandanguo, and Milimani, where nearly all schools were turned into security camps. Timamy, who has been a frequent visitor to the village, promised to keep supporting the community to improve their living standards and health care. He said his government is completing the Kiangwe Dispensary, which is set to be completed this month.&ldquo;I thank President Kenyatta for ensuring there is security in this area,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.Education executive Hamisi Kaviha promised to bring two more teachers before the end of the year.He said the county government has paid full fees to students from the remote village in secondary and university.Basuba MCA aspirant Barissa Bana, who hails from Kiangwe, is among those who schooled from the remote area but still made it.He said he aims to push for the upgrading of infrastructure, education standards and land ownership among residents.
