The Kwale government has denied colluding with Base Titanium to authorise extended exploration of minerals in lands adjacent to the allowed area. Governor Salim Mvurya&rsquo;s opponents, among them Wiper&rsquo;s Chirau Mwakwere, have been bashing him over an alleged underhand dealing to have the mining company and his office grab some land and explore it for minerals.County director of communication Kauli Mwembe in a statement on Wednesday, said, "The claims are not only inaccurate but also misplaced, ill conceived and at best a figment of the proponents imagination."Mwakwere, Issa Chipera of ODM, Gereza Dena (independent) and Sammy Ruwa (independent), all eyeing Mvurya&rsquo;s seat, have been using minerals and land issues to discredit his administration.They claim his defection to Jubilee was a scheme to grab and exploit land and minerals with "outsiders".In his visits to the county in February and May, President Uhuru Kenyatta defended Mvurya against the allegations and threatened to expose Mwakwere&rsquo;s "dirty deals", while he was in government.In February, he said, &ldquo;Those claiming Governor Mvurya joined Jubilee to grab land in Kwale should know we have no interest in anyone&rsquo;s land. Everyone has the right to live anywhere and own land. If you sell your land it is okay.&rdquo;On Thursday, Mwembe said the Constitution and the Mining Act 2016, have vested the responsibility of issuance of special mining licence in the national government.&ldquo;There exists specific roles between the two levels of government in regard to mining," . &ldquo;It is evident therefore that the proponents of this misleading narrative are deliberately choosing to misrepresent facts, hence the need to set the record straight,&rdquo; said Mwembe.In the statement, the director of communication explained the chronology of events that led to Base Titanium admitting to its intention to conduct further exploration in the county.Mwembe said the county has always acted in the best interests of the locals.&ldquo;Sometime in early September 2016, the Office of the Governor learnt with shock and disbelief about the publication of an application for a Special Prospecting License in the Kenya Gazette of 12th August 2016m,&rdquo; he said.Mvurya&rsquo;s office learnt that the alleged renewal of the current mining agreement by Base Titanium was for a further term of two years from May 26, 2016. This caused anxiety and tension in the affected areas of the Mrima Hills, forcing Mvurya to write to Mining CS Dan Kazungu, urging him to revoke the whole process due to the apparent procedural and legal inconsistencies.Kazungu attended a leaders meeting at the Kenya School of Government in Matuga over the matter, Mwembe said.&ldquo;After listening to all the stakeholders, the CS directed that the exploration exercise be put on hold, awaiting further direction from the ministry,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;It is evident the county government of Kwale has consistently advocated for the rights and the well-being of the people of Kwale, and in particular, those in the areas targeted for exploration.&rdquo;
