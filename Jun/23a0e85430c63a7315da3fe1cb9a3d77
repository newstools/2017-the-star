Leaders from Western have called for an inquest into the murder of Mumias Sugar Company secretary Ronald Lubya, saying the probe should go beyond a parliamentary select committee. NASA principal Musalia Mudavadi said an inquest will ensure that even the firm’s board members are interrogated. He spoke on Saturday at Lubya’s funeral service in Ivona Primary School, Vihiga county. Mudavadi was with Vihiga Governor Moses Akaranga, Senator George Khaniri, Kakamega Deputy Governor Philip Kitima, MPs Alfred Agoi (Sabatia), Yusuf Chanzu (Vihiga), Ayub Savula (Lugari) and Wilbur Ottichilo (Emuhaya). Mudavadi said, “We shall not rest; we cannot have public servants killed because they have refused to dance to certain people’s tune.” “It is very strange that the entire Mumias Company Board is not here, yet the company secretary is buried today.” It is even more suspicious that the board did not even send a message of condolence, the Amani National Congress leader added. He said after the exit of the company’s CEO Errol Johnson, the secretary was now in charge and there was a lot of pressure on him to authorise Sh10 million from the Sugar Development Levy to go to unknown people. Mudavadi said the other reason Lubya was killed was that he refused the re-branding of imported sugar from South Sudan. “I can see Law Society of Kenya members are here. I know they will dig deep into this matter and it can start with an inquest with the board members and also the phone records,” he said. No other Kenyan should die the way Lubya died, Mudavadi said. Akaranga said, “I don’t know why President Uhuru Kenyatta has not attended this burial, yet he is in the neighbouring county of Kakamega, just a few kilometres from here.” Khaniri said Lubya’s killers are known and should not walk away scot free. Lubya was killed because he refused to heed to pressure to allow illegal importation and branding of sugar from South Sudan, he said.
