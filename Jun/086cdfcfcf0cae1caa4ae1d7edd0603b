Willy Paul recently released a new single by the name Digiri, where he emphasises that a singer or entertainer does not need a degree or an award to go to heaven, a message perceived to be aimed at Groove Awards.Willy Paul, real name Wilson Abubakar Radido, has been snubbed by the coveted awards two years in a row, something he did not take lightly. The same fate befell his longtime frenemy Bahati.On the same interview, Willy Paul removed his socks on live TV, claiming that his socks were making him uncomfortable, but we all know that he pulled off that move so he can show off his new Gucci shoes.Other than that, his new song Digiri has also received a lot of criticism from some of the fans and singers, who feel that the message is not Godly at all yet he's a gospel singer.But Willy Paul does not seem to be bothered by his critics, and is going on about his business, and even shared a video with the cryptic message: "MAN, I DON'T CARE."Looks like this young man will never be moved by his haters in any way.
