The Senate Energy Committee yesterday failed to kick off after all members failed to turn up for the meeting at Parliament Buildings. Senators, who are members of the committee chaired by Baringo Senator Gideon Moi, were engaged elsewhere. The members of the committee included Dan Mwanzo (Taita Taveta), Kipchumba Murkomen (Elgeiyo Marakwet), Kiraitu Murungi (Meru), Abu Chiaba (Lamu), Paul Wamatangi (Kiambu), David Musila of Kitui, Turkana&rsquo;s John Munyes, and Elizabeth Ongoro (nominated).The members were to question the management of Kenya Pipeline Company, Zakhen International Constructions Ltd, and other sub-contractors involved in the construction of the Mombasa-Nairobi oil pipeline.But as usual, only three sub-contractors - Quality Inspectors Limited, Straccon Engineering Ltd, and Dynamic Green Technologies Ltd showed up.There was no representative from the Lebanese company.The pipeline is expected to move 6.8 billion litres of petroleum by 2020 and remove 700 petroleum trucks from roads daily. The committee, which has been investigating the proposed extension of the contract period, is this morning expected to meet top officials of the companies.In March this year, Moi told a journalist &ndash; after another meeting with officials failed to kick off &ndash; that his committee &ldquo; was now suspecting elements of international fraud&rdquo;.He then gave Zakhem and KPC, and the sub-contractors two weeks to appear.&ldquo;The committee is very disappointed. We have given them another two weeks - to appear on March 14 &ndash; failing which we will issue summonses, including international summonses. We feel there are elements of fraud that have been perpetuated,&rdquo; Moi told the journalist.He had been informed that the officials of Zakhem were out of the country, while KPC officials said they were given short notice.Moi said his committee is contemplating ordering a complete audit of the entire pipeline project to ascertain if there was value for taxpayers money.Zakhem has demanded an extra Sh10 billion, even after receiving Sh30 billion and doing 65 per cent of the work. KPC granted the contractor an extension up to April 28, 2017 to complete the project.
