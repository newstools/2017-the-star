Abdirizak Ismail, a candidate for Garissa’s Galbeth ward seat, had the last laugh on Thursday after a court in Nairobi ruled he should be given the ODM certificate. Ismail and incumbent Ibrahim Ali, who is assembly majority leader, have been tussling over the ticket for a month. Ismail tried to present his papers at the IEBC offices on May 28. But he was told by returning officer Dulacha Boru that ODM had two candidates in Galbeth ward and that the party had to nominate one person. The two took their case to the Political Parties Dispute Tribunal and the IEBC dispute resolution tribunal, which referred the matter to ODM for fresh nominations. Speaking to the press outside the IEBC offices after being given the IEBC nomination certificate, Ismail apologised to the people for being subjected to ‘a lot of anxiety.’ Ismail urged aspirants to conduct peaceful campaigns. He told residents not to allow politicians to divide them along clan and religious lines.
