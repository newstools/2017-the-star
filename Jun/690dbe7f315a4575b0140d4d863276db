The armyworm invasion and destruction of cereals in parts of Meru are threatening to make the county dependent on government food and other aid. Agriculture chief officer Kinge Manene on Thursday said the pests have destroyed crops in Imenti North, Central, South and Tigania West. He said the county has developed methods to combat the pest to ensure farmers are food secure. “We are grateful for the interventions by the national government to supply pesticides, supplementing what the county is doing towards controlling the armyworm. They have already attacked cereal crops in Imenti North, Central, South and Tigania West. We will push to ensure crops are safe and farmers do not incur losses,” Manene said. Representatives from CS Willy Bett’s office, led by department assistant director Teresia Karanja, delivered a 1,500-litre consignment of pesticides to Meru town on Thursday. She said the programme will be carried out across the country. first reported in march The armyworm was first reported in March. It affects maize, a staple food crop, and many other crops. Armywrms like to eat rice, pasture grasses, wheat, millet, sorghum, some vegetables, potatoes, soybeans, cotton and tobacco. “We have a Western and Central Kenya team which is enhancing what the counties are doing to rescue farmers,” Karanja said. Meru is a major banana producer because of its fertile soil. The armyworm had initially wreaked havoc in Western, North and South Rift regions. The worst-hit counties include Baringo, Bungoma, Busia, Kakamega, Kericho, Nakuru, Nandi, Narok, Siaya and Uasin Gishu.
