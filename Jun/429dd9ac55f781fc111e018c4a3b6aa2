Kenya&rsquo;s capital markets regulator said yesterday that it had not received any notification about a proposed acquisition by KCB Group of a stake in National Bank of Kenya.Last week, documents seen by Reuters showed that KCB had proposed taking over National Bank through a share swap, saying it would initially take over 70 per cent of its shares, before announcing its offer for the remaining stake.&ldquo;We wish to clarify that no regulatory filings have been made to the Authority by KCB Group regarding this matter and no confirmation of the existence of such a transaction has been received,&rdquo; the Capital Markets Authority said in a statement. KCB&rsquo;s CEO Joshua Oigara confirmed that the bank had sent an expression of interest in acquiring a controlling stake in NBK to the finance ministry but offered no more details.
