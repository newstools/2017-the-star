Victims of political violence and sexual assault are using P3 medical forms to blackmail assailants.Home Bay police commander John Omusanga yesterday expressed concern that many assault victims are misusing the forms to extort money.He said some residents also use the forms to threaten suspected offenders to get money, instead of taking them to court.The police boss said, &ldquo;They pick the forms but instead of going to a doctor to fill it out and return it for recording a statement, they directly engage the offenders in a dialogue aimed at obtaining money from them.&rdquo;He was joined by county commissioner Kassim Farrah, addressing journalists in Farrah&rsquo;s office. They said getting justice through the courts becomes difficult if suspected offenders cooperate with the victims.Farrah said rally permits are required.
