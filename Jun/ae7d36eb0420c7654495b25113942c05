The latest building collapse in Nairobi, that of a six-storey structure on Monday night in Kware on the Pipeline Estate, Embakasi, is a scandal. Five people are missing. After the collapse of a building on the Huruma estate, another poor area of the city, in June last year, City Hall marked many buildings as unfit for human habitation and placed them on a demolition list of more than 55 structures. But the buildings’ owners rushed to court and filed suit to prevent the demolitions. On April 21, 2016, a building marked for demolition collapsed, also in Huruma, Nairobi, killing 51 people. In May 2016, City Hall evacuated tenants in buildings that had been marked for demolition. The city’s unsafe structures are the result of corrupt actions by a chain of actors, including their owners, building contractors, City Hall inspectors and the National Contractors’ Association of Kenya. Nairobi county Lands executive Christopher Khaemba said in March that only 41 out of the 2,000 earmarked for demolishing have been flattened. This is unacceptable.
