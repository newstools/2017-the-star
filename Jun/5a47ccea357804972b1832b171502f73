The Council of Governors has directed county payroll managers to stop remitting nurses monthly contributions to the health worker's union.The CoG argues that KNUN has to demonstrate proof of compliance with the recognition agreement they signed before the monies are remitted to the union.The union has at least 26,000 members of which 16,000 contribute at least Sh5 million every month.In a circular dated June 17, the CoG cites the crisis at the union's leadership where two factions are divided over the legitimacy of the industrial action.KNUN chairman John Bii has disowned the strike terming it 'illegal' while secretary general Seth Panyako maintains the workers are legally on strike."We are aware that the ongoing strike has been joined by nurses who are members of other unions such as KUDHEIHA, KCGWU, and KUCS," the circular signed by Turkana Governor Josephat Nanok reads.Panyako on Sunday termed the move as one aimed to paralyse the union's operations as the strike entered its 15th day."We will continue running the union using other contributions and let Nanok know that if they block the contributions, the nurses will contribute directly."He termed the threats as 'empty' adding that it will not kill their spirits to push for the CBA to be signed."What the CoG is trying to do is infringe the rights of the nurses and freedom of association," Panyako told the Star.KNUN has reaffirmed that the strike will continue despite the fallout witnessed on Friday last week.Deputy Secretary General Maurice Opetu said the governors are only engaging in sideshows to distract the nurses."It has no impact. It will not let the nurses relent. We will continue to soldier on until our demands are met," Opetu said.This came after the CoG termed the go-slow illegal and ordered the health workers to resume work or be sacked.Opetu said the two levels of government should address the issue at hand which is to sign the CBA that was negotiated in January.Nurses in the 47 counties are demanding the registration of the agreement.Read: Nurses issued sack notice as strike enters second weekAlso read: Attempts to call off nurses strike thwarted as officials nearly exchange blows
