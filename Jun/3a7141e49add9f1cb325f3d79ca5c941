A Homa Bay resident wants a court to verify the authenticity of a degree certificate obtained by Kasipul MP Oyugi Magwanga. The lawmaker is running for governor as an independent after he lost to incumbent Cyprian Awiti. On Tuesday, George Omondi said he has evidence to prove the lawmaker&rsquo;s academic qualifications are fake. The certificate shows he enrolled for a bachelor of project planning and management degree at the University of Nairobi in 2013. &ldquo;The degree was introduced in May 2012 and Magwanga was admitted in 2013 but his marks in the first year are for 2011/12 academic year,&rdquo; the affidavit states. Omondi says Magwanga obtained the certificate to avoid being locked out of the 2013 polls. The applicant said records show Magwanga is pursuing a masters degree in project planning at the UoN, but his file is missing. He has written to the Commission for University Education to investigate. The case will be heard on June 7.
