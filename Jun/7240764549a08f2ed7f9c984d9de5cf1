NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga requires unwavering numerical strength in the National Assembly and Senate to effectively discharge the duties of that office, Siaya Senator James Orengo (pictured) has said.He said for Raila&rsquo;s government to survive threats from the opposition, including impeachment, it needs to unilaterally control the Senate, National Assembly and county assemblies.&ldquo;Raila wants the six-piece voting pattern, including the governor, whom he can easily work with in reference to resource allocation and distribution,&rdquo; Orengo said.He warned that electing few ODM legislators will make Raila a lame-duck President who will be forced to dance to the whims of his opponents.Orengo spoke on Saturday in Ulumba village, Ugunja constituency, during the burial of his paternal uncle Charles.
