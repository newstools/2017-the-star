Kitui Senator David Musila has said he would have shot at those who destroyed his campaign billboard in Kitui town if he found them in the act.A few weeks ago, the 10-metre campaign billboard was damaged. Police have yet to arrest the culprits.&ldquo;I could have shot at them and regretted it later because what they did amounted to impunity. No one bothers even though I lodged a complaint. The matter ended there,&rdquo; Musila said.He expressed concern that security agencies are not doing enough to bring to end intolerant behaviours. Musila is in the race for governor as an independent against incumbent Julius Malombe and Narc&rsquo;s Charity Ngilu.He said the culprits are known and details of the vehicle they used were provided to police, but nothing has been done. Musila spoke when he met county commissioner Boaz Cherutich and NCIC officers, who have been deployed to the county to monitor violence and hate speech during election campaigns.He said some candidates resort to violence after being provoked by their rivals because security agencies fail to act. He urged security agencies to do their work without fear or favour.
