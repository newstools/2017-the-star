The Kenyan political
party has evolved considerably since Independence. It is often
forgotten, or not noticed at all, even by media researchers, that the Independence
General Election, held May 18-26, 1963, was actually a multiparty electoral
event. What’s more, it had
independent candidates and they won a creditable 4.32 per cent of the vote. And,
yes, there were incidents of pre-election violence, even under the watchful and
all-seeing eye of the departing British colonists. This was the last
election before the first Madaraka Day on June 1 and the first Jamhuri Day on
December 12, that same year. It would also
effectively be the last multiparty General Election in Kenya until 1992 and the
last at which independents were out to make a point, until the August 8, 2017
event, now 67 days down the road. According to
Wikipedia, quoting Nohlen, D, Krennerich, M & Thibaut, B (1999) Elections in Africa: A Data handbook,
p486) the Kenya African National Union of Jomo Kenyatta, Jaramogi Oginga
Odinga, James Gichuru and Tom Mboya, among other nationalist struggle bigwigs,
won 83 of the 124 seats in the House of Representatives and 18 of the 38 seats
in the Senate. Five seats in the House and 38 seats in the Senate went unfilled
in the face of the Shifta disturbances in Northeastern, then designated the
Northern Frontier District, or NFD. Wikipedia goes on, “A
total of 275 candidates contested the elections for the House of
Representatives; 90 from Kanu, 59 from the Kenya African Democratic Union (Kadu),
20 from the African People's Party (APP), five from the Baluhya Political Union
(BPU), three from the Coast People's Party and 98 independents”. Kanu won with
1,028,906 votes, or 59.18 per cent, followed by Kadu with 474,933 (18 per
cent), the APP with 147,039 (27.43 per cent), the BPU with 5,520 (0.32 per
cent) and independents with 82,328 (4.32 percent). It would be the first
and last General Election in Kenya in which the winning party was not a power
incumbent until the 2002 event that would remove Kanu from office. All other
elections before 2002 and thereafter were tightly managed and their results
announced by the government of the day. The second General
Election was scheduled for May 1968, but President Kenyatta, aged around 80,
was taken ill while on his annual “working holiday” at the Coast and it was
postponed to late 1969. According to his biographer Duncan Ndegwa, in Walking in Kenyatta Struggles My Story (New
English Press 2011), Jomo had descended into a diabetic coma and it was a
medical miracle that he climbed out of it. Kanu now ruled Kenya
as a de facto one-party state after the banning of former Vice President
Odinga’s Kenya People’s Union on October 30, 1969 following the violence at the
opening of the Russian-built Nyanza Provincial General Hospital on October 25
the same year, a presidential function. The Second General
Election was therefore a strictly one-party affair.  Wikipedia has the following statistics for
the 1969 polls: “600 Kanu candidates stood for the 158 seats in the newly
unicameral National Assembly, with 77 incumbents defeated. Voter turnout was
44.6 per cent. Following the election, a further 12 members were appointed by Kenyatta.”  THE FIRST 100 PER
CENT WIN IN A KENYAN GENERAL ELECTION The Fourth General
Election – and President Kenyatta’s last – was held on October 14, 1974, under
de facto one-party state conditions and Kanu garnered 2,627,308 votes, or 100
per cent. Wikipedia reports, “740 Kanu candidates stood for the 158 National
Assembly seats, with 88 incumbents (including four ministers) defeated. Voter
turnout was 56.5 per cent. Following the election, a further 12 members were appointed
by President Jomo Kenyatta.” Among the fallen
ministers was Dr Njoroge Mungai, the President’s relative and personal
physician and a sworn political foe of Vice President Daniel arap Moi (in
office since 1967) and Attorney General Charles Njonjo (in office since 1963).
Mungai was among the foremost of the so-called Kiambu Mafia political elite who
were opposed to VP Moi – or any other non-Kikuyu – succeeding Jomo. Njonjo,
himself Kikuyu, disagreed completely with this Mt Kenyan chauvinism and would
play kingmaker to Moi as Jomo’s successor when the time came. Njonjo is still
alive, hale and hearty at 97, but rarely publicly discusses politics. President Jomo
Kenyatta died at State House Mombasa on the night of August 21-22 1978. The
following afternoon Moi was sworn in at State House, Nairobi, as acting
President for a period of 90 days at a Cabinet meeting attended and for the
most part controlled by Njonjo as AG and ex officio member of the council of
ministers. The next three
general elections in Kenya — 1979, 1983 and 1988 — were completely controlled
by the state, the latter two under conditions of a de jure one-party state.
President Moi, Vice President Mwai Kibaki and AG Charles Njonjo had
transitioned Kenya from its de facto one-party state to de jure by the
expedient of Section 2(a) of the Constitution in 1982. Kanu was now the only
legitimate political party and authority in Kenya.  ‘ETHNICITY AND ETHNIC
KINGS’ Kenyan scholar Korwa
G. Adar, in his article “Ethnicity and Ethnic Kings: The Enduring Dual
Constraint in Kenya's Multiethnic Democratic Electoral Experiment”, published
in Journal of the Third World Spectrum
5, No 2 (Fall 1998), had this to say on Section 2(a): “Kenya was made a
one-party state through the 1982 Constitutional Amendment, Clause 2(a), which
took only twenty minutes to pass in Parliament. Opposition or even dissenting
views within the Kanu hierarchy was officially buried, with the backbenchers’ ‘unofficial
opposition stance in Parliament’ being forcefully dismantled. “Indeed, the
institutionalisation of one-partyism was based on the assumption that
henceforth, Kenya was to become a monolithic society in which dissenting views
were perceived to be non-existent both at the voter and parliamentary candidate
levels. It was on this operational practise that Oginga Odinga and George
Anyona were expelled from Kanu following their announcement to form the Kenya
National Socialist Alliance (KASA) in 1982”. Nine years later, in
November 1991, under immense pressure in the international context of the end
of the Cold War as signaled by the fall of the Berlin War and President Kenneth
Kaunda’s fall in Zambia (defeated in a multiparty election) and the clamour for
the restoration of political pluralism in Kenya, President Moi finally presided
over the removal of Section 2a and the holding of Kenya’s first multiparty poll
in December 1992.  DEMOCRACY DEFINED AS ‘ABSENCE
OF COLONIALISM’ Adar also noted in
his essay “Ethnicity and Ethnic Kings”, that, “As far as Kenya and other
African states are concerned, democracy seems to have been associated with the
absence of colonialism. The leaders gradually usurped power and eroded the
chances for the establishment of sustainable democratic electoral systems, some
even declaring themselves presidents for life (Banda of Malawi and Bokasa of
Central African Republic)”. Mzee Kenyatta was
effectively a President for Life, without being declared one. His successor Moi
served 24 years in the office, an entire generation, and moved Kenya from a de
facto to a de jure one-party state and finally presided over the restoration of
pluralism. The template set by
Kanu’s one-party state and Big Man of politics attended by a personality cult
and the powerful party that demands absolute loyalty and group think began to
unravel in Kenya with the restoration of political pluralism in 1991, but it
has had a long hangover. What’s more, it has spilled over into parties that
have never provided Kenya with a President – among them ODM, Wiper and Ford
Kenya.  These three Opposition outfits
have however provided Kenya with only its second Prime Minister (ODM’s Raila in
2008-2012), the 10th and last Vice President (Wiper’s Kalonzo in
2008-2012) and two consecutive VPs (Ford Kenya’s Michael Kijana Wamalwa in
2002-2005 and Moody Awori in 2005-2007).   RISE OF THE
INDEPENDENTS & THE 2017 RACE The evolution of the
Kenyan political party has never been more marked than during the all-party
nominations for the 12th General Election held between April 13 and
30 this year. They were a sight to behold – shambolic through and through, with
biggest parties ODM and Jubilee being the worst organized and generating the
most spectacular fallout.  The sons
respectively of founding President Jomo (President Uhuru) and founding VP
Jaramogi (former PM Raila) were revealed as Big Man-of-Party-Politics figures
and their parties as still suffering an enormous Kanu mindset hangover. The result of the
chaotic primaries was the rise of independent candidates in numbers never
before witnessed in a Kenyan General Election – almost 5,000. Something has
snapped somewhere. And both President Uhuru and NASA presidential flagbearer
Raila have been extremely slow, even distinctly confused, on the uptake,
sending out confusing signals on how the traditional big parties they lead
should deal with the independents’ phenomenon. Raila has expressly
ordered the ODM faithful not to vote for independents. Uhuru remains
ambivalent, asking only that the independents in his strongholds take care they
do not divide the Presidential vote. One of the wonders of
Election Day August 8 will be how the independents fare and what difference
they make in the Presidential race outcome.
