The Kenya National Union of Nurses has said it will not renegotiate the CBA.The union, which called a nation-wide strike on Monday last week, seeks to compel the counties to sign and register the CBA which the Salaries and Remuneration Commission dismissed, saying the Sh40 billion required to effect it was unreasonable.Nurses from Uasin Gishu and Nyeri counties are not participating in the strike.The Council of Governors last week termed the strike illegal. It said the correct procedure entails giving a legal notice of a strike.The CoG also said the nurses went on strike prematurely as negotiations to conclude the CBA were at an advanced stage. Speaking to the Star, KNUN acting secretary general Maurice Opetu accused the county bosses- through the CoG &ndash; of sabotaging the signing and registration of the deal.NO OTHER OFFER&ldquo;No offer is going to be tabled again.The negotiated CBA was presided over by officials from the county and theywere under the SRC guidelines so all we are waiting for is the signing and registration, and, without this, regardless of the time, nurses will not go back to work,&rdquo; he said. The union has dismissed calls to use interns to assist patients in hospitals.&ldquo;It is illegal and wrong for medical interns to work without guidance or supervision from a qualified nurse,&rdquo;Opetu said.The CBA was set to be signed on March 2 and its contents included a risk allowance of Sh15,400, extraneous allowance of Sh5,000, responsibility allowances of Sh5,000 and uniform allowance of Sh50,000 per year.Speaking to the Star yesterday,KNUN Machakos branch secretary general Halima Adan said she was happy Cotu supports the strike.&ldquo;We are asking for a very small increment, less than that in the teachers&rsquo; CBA, yet they have already received their money, so the SRC narrative fails to add up,&rdquo; she said. SACK THREATSIn Kakamega, the 1, 300 striking nurses were given until yesterday to resume duty or be sacked.In a notice served to all nurses and heads of health facilities, county health executive Peninah Mukabane suspended the take-up of annual leave and ordered nurses who were on leave before the strike begun to report back to work immediately.In Bomet, nurses have warned Governor Isaac Ruto and some health officials against issuing sack threats to them for participating in the strike.During the 100-day doctors&rsquo; strike, Bomet was one of the few counties where medics went to work.
