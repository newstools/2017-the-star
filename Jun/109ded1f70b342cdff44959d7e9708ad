Employment at the Kenya Ports Authority is skewed and favours only those who have godfathers, nominated Senator Emma Mbura has said.She said qualified Coast people are left out in favour of relatives and friends of powerful people in the national government.&ldquo;Godfathers are bringing in people from all over the country for employment at the port and leave out those from the Coast,&rdquo; Mbura said.She said such issues are part of the reasons for the increase of outlawed groups and criminal gangs.Mbura asked the county and the national governments to address the matter to avoid problems.&ldquo;Some people are being called by their godfathers from the comfort of their homes to go for interviews, which are just a smokescreen, because already there are predetermined lists of candidates who will &lsquo;pass&rsquo; the interviews and get employed,&rdquo; she told the Star on the phone on Monday evening.The senator will seek a statement from Transport CS James Macharia over the number of people employed at the KPA and their academic qualification. She says she will also seek to get the regional composition of the workers at the port.Parliament adjourns on June 15.
