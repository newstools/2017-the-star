Private sector performance declined last month to record an average 49.9 just below the neutral 50.0 threshold a monthly survey showed yesterday, citing a marginal drop in output.The Purchasing Managers&rsquo; Index survey by mid-tier lender Stanbic Bank and research firm IHS Markit indicated that weaker overall business conditions were experienced by the private sector compared to 50.3 recorded in April.Data is collected through monthly questionaires sent out to 400 companies from sectors including agriculture, mining, manufacturing, services, construction and retail.The index reading was the second lowest behind March&rsquo;s record-low of 48.5 observed since the inception of the series in January 2014 remaining below the overall series average of 54.6.&ldquo;As we highlighted last month, the recovery in business conditions could prove to be transitory, due to a cocktail of dangerous headwinds,&rdquo; Stanbic Bank regional economist for East Africa Jibran Qureshi said.He attributed the deterioration to a drop in production output and slow growth in new orders attributed to increased financial constraints and weak consumer demand due to the upcoming August 8 polls.Lending to the private sector, especially SMEs has slowed down since the implementation of the interest rate cap last September as commercial banks try to avert high credit risk.Central Bank governor Patrick Njoroge however noted last week that there has been a rebound private sector credit growth especially to manufacturing, real estate and private households.The survey indicated that output reduced for the third time in four months which the private sector blamed on weaker purchasing power, lower customer turnout and the electioneering period.The report further shows that private companies in May posted a modest growth rate in new export orders which expanded for the tenth consecutive month.Growth in new orders encouraged firms to increase their payroll numbers fast-tracking the rate of job creation to a five-month high. Financial constraints faced by firms, and rising new order levels have placed pressure on operating capacity.Buying activity increased during May, but the rate of growth was the weakest observed in 19 months. At the same time, firms raised their input stocks at the fastest pace in three months. The survey also indicated that firms faced upward inflationary pressures due to higher fuel costs and a general increase in raw material prices.
