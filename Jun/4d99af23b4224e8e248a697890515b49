We will dispatch veterinary officers to areas like Bar&rsquo;goni, Mpeketoni, Lake Amu, Hongwe, Lumshi, Pangani, Pandanguo, Witu and other areas of Lamu West. We will also go as far as Kiunga in Lamu East. These are areas mostly inhabited by pastoralists and we will ensure all their animals get vaccinated,&rdquo; said Mathenge.He called on all residents to render their cooperation in ensuring the exercise is a success.&ldquo;Many at times when we hold such exercises, people don&rsquo;t turn up with their animals. The exercise is free of charge and I am appealing to all livestock owners to turn up in large numbers so that their animals get vaccinated to prevent infections,&rdquo; said Mathenge.
