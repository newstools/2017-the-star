Google has been slapped with a record &pound;2.1billion fine for skewing search results in favour of its own shopping services in a fresh blow to the US web giant.The European Commission's decision to levy the record penalty for breaking anti-trust laws is likely to anger US President Donald Trump. And the web giant now faces a string of legal cases from rivals claiming their businesses have been harmed by its actions. EC competition chief Margrethe Vestager said Google had 'abused its market dominance' as the world's most popular search engine. "What Google has done is illegal under EU antitrust rules. It denied other companies the chance to compete on the merits and to innovate," she said. "And most importantly, it denied European consumers a genuine choice of services and the full benefits of innovation."While an EU record, this is well below the maximum possible of about 8 billion euros (&pound;7m) or 10 per cent of Google's total revenue last year. It comes a year after EC competition chief Margrethe Vestage angered the Obama administration with an order that Apple repay 13 billion (&pound;11.5m) euros in back taxes in Ireland.The case is one of three against Google and of several against blockbuster US companies including Starbucks, Apple, Amazon and McDonalds.In the other Google cases, the EU is examining Google's AdSense advertising service and its Android mobile phone software.The cases have stoked tensions with Washington and could now face the wrath of US President Donald Trump, who won office on his 'America First' slogan.The Commission, which polices EU competition policy, launched an initial investigation into Google in 2010 following complaints from rivals such as Microsoft and Trip Advisor that it favoured its own shopping services when customers ran searches.Vestager's predecessor, Joaquin Almunia, made three attempts to resolve the dispute but in each case intense pressure by national governments, rivals and privacy advocates scuppered the effort.Google said it 'respectfully disagrees' with EU fine and is considering an appeal.
