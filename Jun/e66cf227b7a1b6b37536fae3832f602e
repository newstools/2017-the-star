The 2015 champions Butali Warriors hope to bounce back to winning ways then they take on Chase Sailors in a mid-week Premier League match at City Park Stadium. A barren draw against Greensharks in their last match denied them a chance to ascend to the second spot as well as close the gap between them and runaway leaders Kenya Police. Sailors succumbed to a 2-1 defeat at the hands of Nakuru Hockey Club on June 17.With the Butali vs Police clash set for Saturday, Godfrey Wakachunga&rsquo;s charges cannot afford to drop more points when they face mid-tablers Chase Sailors today. This will be Sailors&rsquo; first meeting against the Western outfit since their promotion to the elite league.The bankers have registered two wins in nine games and lie tenth with 10 points on the standings and could lose more today when they face a side which is yet to taste defeat.Butali&rsquo;s head coach Wakachunga has called for a response from his charges, warning that anything short of a win will spell doom on their title ambitions. Emmanuel Simuyu will lead the attack assisted by Frank Wanangwe while Lawrence Okubasu and Seth Oburu will be operating on either flanks. A win will see Butali leapfrog Sharks to second place. They may be forced to make changes since their attacking midfielder Brian Musasia is a doubt after a knock during the Sharks match.Chase coach William Oketch, who is a former Butali player, hope his knowledge on his former club will be able to help his charges. &ldquo;Butali have talented players who can create chances from nowhere. We therefore need to disrupt their game plan and put pressure on their defence. We have drawn a lot of matches and I hope the trend can end against Butali,&rdquo; he said. Kenyan International George Mutira&rsquo;s pace could pose a problem for Butali&rsquo;s defence led by Kenneth Nyongesa and Saidi Okwemba.
