NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga does not deserve to lead this country as he presided over corruption when he was Prime Minister, a former Industrialisation assistant minister has said. Speaking on Wednesday, Nderitu Muriithi, Laikipia West MP, said Raila protected ministers from ODM in the grand coalition government. Muriithi, was addressing residents during a series of meetings in Laikipia Central. He is running for Laikipia governor as an independent but is campaigning for President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s reelection. He accused former Tinderet MP Henry Kosgey of siphoning money from public coffers when he was his boss in the ministry. &ldquo;I would go to his [Raila&rsquo;s] office and tell him that Henry was stealing government money but his response was: &lsquo;yes, I will act&rsquo;, but did nothing. Is that the person you want to entrust the country with?&rdquo; Muriithi said at Shallom IDP camp.
