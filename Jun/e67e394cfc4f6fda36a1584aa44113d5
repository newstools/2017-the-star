West Pokot women representative Regina Nyeris (pictured) has asked the government to provide her with security. She said her life has been threatened after she ditched Jubilee for Chama Cha Mashinani. “Jubilee nominations were chaotic and I wasn’t impressed with how they were conducted that is why I had to move out,” Nyeris said. Nyeris was addressing the press at Mtello Hall, Kapenguria, on Wednesday after she was cleared by the IEBC to defend her seat. She said the maize donated by NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga to hunger-stricken families during his rally last week was stolen. “I went to record a statement at the police station but I was barred. I had to force police officers to allow me record the statement,” Nyeris said.
