The Raila Conspiracy subtitled &ldquo;The Secrets Behind Denying Him the Kenyan Presidency&rdquo; is a 415-page book by Babior Newton. It is the third and latest biography of Raila Odinga after Nigerian academic Babafemi Badejo&rsquo;s The Enigma of Kenya Politics {2005} and journalist Sarah Elderkin&rsquo;s The Flame of Freedom {2011}.Newton, an acquaintance of the late Fidel Odinga, who first introduced the concept of this biography to his father, writes in the Acknowledgements, &ldquo;I will leave the nit-picking to critics, syndicated columnists, cynics and political pundits, who I predict will inevitably subject this work to partisanship, prejudice and propaganda&rdquo;.Its Foreword is by the former Prime Minister himself, who comments, &ldquo;It is not an easy task to write a foreword to a book about yourself. But I took pleasure in writing this; first out of my deep belief in supporting the efforts of our young people who have shown a deep and burning desire to understand where our country has been or is coming from as a way of constructing what could be its viable path into the future.&rdquo;The Preface is by Morgan Tsvangirai, former opposition leader and Prime Minister of Zimbabwe, who says, &ldquo;As you read this carefully crafted biography, consider this man &ndash; this son of Africa &ndash; as a gift to the continent.&rdquo;The Star&rsquo;s Weekend Edition will serialise some chapters of The Raila Conspiracy on June 17 and 24.
