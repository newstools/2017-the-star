Cabinet Secretaries will campaign for Jubilee in simultaneous radio interviews on Thursday. They are expected to detail Jubilee's accomplishments in different sectors in the sessions that will run from 7.30am to 8am.  Youths CS Sicily Kariuki will be on Radio Maisha, Energy CS Charles Keter on Kass FM and Education CS Fred Matiangi on Egesa FM. Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery will speak on Maiyan FM, Information's Joe Mucheru on Radio Citizen and Water's Eugene Wamalwa on Mulembe FM. Devolution CS Mwangi Kiunjuri will be interviewed on Inooro FM. Members of the public will engage them on social media using hash tag #GOKDelivers.  This comes on the backdrop of Jubilee's push for Elections Laws, 2016 to be amended so it can campaign on media platforms ahead of the August 8 polls. In the amendment bill by National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale, a provision in the laws, which bars the government from highlighting its achievements through the media in an election year, will be deleted. “No government shall publish any advertisements of achievements of the respective government either in the print media, electronic media, or by way of banners or hoarding in public places during the election period,” Subsection 2 of Section 35 of the Elections Offences Act reads. Jubilee says, however, that the provision violates the constitution because it denies Kenyans the right to access information held by the state.
