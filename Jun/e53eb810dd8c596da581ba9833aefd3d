In November 2015, Chameleone&rsquo;s family received the sad news that their brother Emmanuel Mayanja, alias AK47, was no more.AK47 was also the brother of Uganda&rsquo;s Weasel and singer Pallaso.A lot of things were said concerning the death of AK 47, and for the first time, Pius Mayanja, also known as Pallaso, their younger brother, has spoken up.In an exclusive interview with Word Is, Pallaso talked about the most vulnerable moment of his life that really broke his heart.A fan wrote him a WhatsApp message, saying that he, the Go Down Low hitmaker, had killed his own brother.&ldquo;I would block every person that said bad things about my brother and one day, there was a person who inboxed me very terrible words. That's the one person that crushed me so bad, but the good thing it was a WhatsApp number. I got the number and posted it on all my social media with everything he wrote and asked everybody to reply to him for me.&rdquo;He added: &ldquo;He wanted attention and I gave him plenty. His family reached me and they were like our son is being threatened and please, we are sorry, we want you to forgive him.&rdquo;Talking about how he feels when people recklessly talk and give theories about their late brother&rsquo;s untimely death, Pallaso said: &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t gotten over it. I can never get over it. I can never go through it. It goes on, you know, it hurts. I see my mother cry, she has never healed, we all have never healed. But we don&rsquo;t know how he died. All we know is he was a great person. It is very hard for me to explain.&rdquo;Pallaso shared this during his media tour of Kenya, where he is set to collaborate with songbird Vivian and rapper Kush Tracy.
