Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga has survived a third attempt by independent candidates to bar him from the August 8 general election.On June 2, Rasanga&rsquo;s ODM nomination was nullified by the Political Parties Disputes Tribunal, a day after the IEBC approved his bid.The tribunal instructed the party led by Raila Odinga to present a candidate within 72 hours but the Governor sought the High Court's intervention.On Friday, the court upheld Rasanga&rsquo;s nomination.The first complaint was filed by Rasanga&rsquo;s competitor Nicholas Gumbo (Rarieda MP), a week after Rasanga's nominations victory was nullified.Gumbo said the exercise was not free and fair and that Rasanga's votes were much more than his competitors'. Rasanga was named winner after getting 143,446 votes against his Gumbo's 87,467.The court suspended Gumbo&rsquo;s case on grounds that he did not have enough evidence.Dissatisfied by the ruling, the politician moved to the tribunal, determined to get a positive ruling, but the panel also suspended the case saying evidence was insufficient.Walter Okello, Rasanga&rsquo;s head of secretariat, said the third attempt was by Gumbo's supporters.Okello, who is Nominated MCA representing youths, laughed off the politician's efforts saying he should compete based in issues and policies.On May 30, ODM deputy leader Hassan Joho, William Oduol and Siaya Senator James Orengo endorsed Rasanga's re-election bid.More on this: Joho, Orengo and Oduol endorse Rasanga, promote ODM's six-piece votingAlso read: I'll seek Siaya seat with or without ODM, Gumbo says after Rasanga wins
