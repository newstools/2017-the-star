Embu Senator Lenny Kivuti has claimed credit for the University of Embu&rsquo;s upgrade, saying he fought off a saboteur.He said if it were not for him, the more than five-year-old university would not be in existence. Kivuti said a government official wanted to sabotage its construction.The senator, who is vying for Embu governor on the Maendeleo Chap Chap party, said he and three local legislators formed a leaders&rsquo; forum to ensure Embu people benefitted.Kivuti said the forum negotiated several development projects during former President Mwai Kibaki&rsquo;s regime, including the university.He said, however, the senior government officer tried to block the upgrade of the then Embu Agricultural Staff Training college to a university.&ldquo;During the December holidays when the officer was on leave, I manoeuvred my way, had a map for the university drawn and completed other documentary details. In a short time, the file was placed before the president who consented to the setting up of the university,&rdquo; said Kivuti.The senator urged Embu residents to elect him, saying the effort he put in during the college upgrade and in other projects is enough to show he has all along had the welfare of the county at heart. He spoke on Saturday in Kairuri Playground, Embu West subcounty, during a campaign meeting.Local elders crowned him an Embu elder and endorsed him for the governor seat.Kivuti said since he was elected senator, he has negotiated for more than Sh23 billion to be allocated by the national government to the county, but little has been done using the money.He said he is prepared to form a transformative government if elected governor and he will involve everybody in its management.Kivuti was accompanied by his running mate Emilio Kathuri and Manyatta MP aspirant John Gitonga.He said he does not want to be governor to earn a salary, but to help the county develop.Others who are vying for the seat are incumbent Martin Wambora (Jubilee), World Bank consultant Kithinji Kiragu (PNU), Democratic Party national organising secretary Njagi Kumantha, entrepreneur Leonard Muriuki (Narc Kenya) and Former PS Cyrus Njiru (independent).
