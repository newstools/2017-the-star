The duo accused Jubilee of not protecting the miraa trade.&ldquo;They gave Sh1 billion to cushion miraa farmers and it has never been utilised in a manner that can help the people. The task force has never produced any results. Within 90 days after we take office we will bring a big difference,&rdquo; Raila said. He is trying to woo Meru, saying he is not the county&rsquo;s enemy.
