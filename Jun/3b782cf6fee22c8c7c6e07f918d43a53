Kajiado county commissioner Harsama Kello has ordered &ldquo;immediate&rdquo; investigations to establish the people behind hate leaflets found strewn all over Ngong town on Saturday night.The circulars warned the Kikuyu, Kisii, Kalenjin and Meru communities of dire consequences come August 7 if they do not leave Kajiado immediately. President Uhuru Kenyatta accused NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga of making hate speech remarks aimed at inciting the Maasais against other communities living in the county.During a campaign rally in Maili 46 town, Kajiado county, on Thursday, Raila said the Maasais have been selling their land to outsiders due to poverty. He said if elected President, he will ensure they do not sell their property to outsiders. Kello condemned those spreading the circulars, saying the government is pursuing the matter &ldquo;seriously&rdquo;.&ldquo;Our officers are on the ground investigating the source of those leaflets. We will close in on those perpetrators spreading hate leaflets that threaten cohesion among the various tribes living in Kajiado. Let this be a warning to everyone attempting to divide Kenyans that we will arrest them regardless of their positions in society,&rdquo; Kello said. Uhuru warned that his government will not sit back and watch inciters destroy the peace enjoyed by Kenyans in Kajiado. Raila has denied making the inflammatory remarks. On Friday, Jubilee secretary general Raphael Tuju wrote to Cohesion and Integration Commission chairman Francis ole Kaparo asking it to investigate Raila. &ldquo;It only requires a small match to start a very large and dangerous fire. And with these comments, Odinga has struck that match,&rdquo; Tuju said in the letter.Governor Evans Kidero and ODM Nairobi branch chairman George Aladwa
