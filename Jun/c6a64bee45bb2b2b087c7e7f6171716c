Two Lamu governor aspirants have denied claims by incumbent Issa Timamy they are someone&rsquo;s projects.He said he is aware that ODM aspirant Abdalla Fadhil and Swaleh Imu (pictured) of Wiper have been set up by his long-time rival Fahim Twaha of Jubilee to divide his votes. Timamy spoke after he was cleared to run by the IEBC on Thursday. The two asked Timamy to stop tainting their names. Speaking separately on Sunday and yesterday in Lamu town, the two said Timamy is &ldquo;An all-time liar, who wants to gain political mileage by mudslinging&rdquo;. Fadhil said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not anybody&rsquo;s project. My objective is to give the people of Lamu a taste of good leadership. What we should be doing as aspirants is to go out there and show people why they need to vote us.&rdquo; Imu said Lamu has a lot of challenges that need quick fixes and that his objective is to repair the damage that Timamy&rsquo;s administration has caused.
