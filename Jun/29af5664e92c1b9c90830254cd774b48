The government and manufacturers have moved closer to fast-tracking implementation of a two-year presidential directive that at least 40 per cent of supplies to state ministries, department and agencies should be sourced locally.President Kenyatta directed state entities on June 1, 2015, to procure at least 40 per cent of supplies locally, but this is yet to be fully implemented.The Kenya Association of Manufacturers and Ministry of Industry and Trade have now partnered to develop the national electronic trade portal that will hold information on all products manufactured locally.KAM and the ministry have invited domestic manufacturers to submit content on products that they produce to be uploaded to eTrade web portal.&ldquo;Its objective is to be the primary site to obtain all the information on Kenya manufactured products and regulatory requirements needed to undertake national, regional and international trade,&rdquo; Phyllis Wakiaga, CEO of KAM told Star.The portal will also provide data for manufacturers to use latest technologies to transform business processes, compete more profitably, and conduct trade electronically across and beyond national borders.The government, on the other hand, will use the portal as a marketing tool for Kenyan products and to improve export competitiveness. It will also link Kenyans manufacturers with potential investors internationally.The plan to develop a list of locally-made products was first announced by Industry and Trade CS Adan Mohamed on September 16, last year. Mohamed had said that state entities will be barred from importing products listed in the portal.&ldquo;Kenya Association of Manufacturers will tell all government departments we do not manufacture these products, and therefore we have no issues for that product to be imported. But for everything that can be made in this country, we will buy those products from Kenyan manufacturers,&rdquo; Mohamed had said.The portal, KAM says, will be a one-stop shop for access to information to ensure compliance in terms of import, export and goods in transit through the country.
