Lugari MP Ayub Savula (ANC) has accused ODM youths of murdering his bodyguard Gerrishom Kwoba on Monday.Savula claimed Kwoba, who was ANC youth leader and a father of seven, was murdered after a public rally in the area.The 40-year-old was stabbed several times in the stomach outside a local bar at Lumani shopping centre."Some ODM youths stabbed him and escaped. We can't fight yet we are in the same family. This matter was politically instigated," Savula said on Tuesday.The MP noted political temperatures should be quelled to prevent clashes and more deaths.Savula asked NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga to solve in-house battles."We must cool political temperatures by competing fairly. I urge our incoming president to intervene before the matter escalates," he said.Kwoba was part of Savula's security detail. The person who attacked him that night has been identified as John Juma.Juma is said to have been a campaigner for ODM's Chevaywa ward MCA aspirant Wambulwa Barasa.He and Kwoba were reportedly drinking at a pub at Lumani market when they differed.Juma allegedly drew a knife and stabbed Kwoba several times before fleeing.Police asked politicians not to politicise the murder.Western police commander Moses Ombati said: &ldquo;We have the identity of the assailant and are looking for him to charge him with murder."&ldquo;Two people differed in a bar. We shall only get to know what happened once we arrest the suspect because no one else was there to give an account."Yesterday, Savula accused ODM and Ford Kenya of engaging in violence to try and dislodge ANC from Lugari.He said people allied to one of his opponents stoned his convoy last weekend and that the matter was under investigation.Savula also said people who defected from ODM and Ford Kenya to ANC have been asked to leave their homes.Kwoba's body was taken to Webuye sub-county hospital mortuary.
