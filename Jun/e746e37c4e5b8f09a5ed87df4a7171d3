Nakuru governor aspirant Senator James Mungai Thursday was turned away by the IEBC after his running mate John Nyaberi failed to produce his degree.Nyaberi, a retired civil servant, turned up for clearance with a letter from the University of Marathwada, India, written B.com.He was at pains to explain why he has never collected his degree for 27 years, since 1990. County returning officer Silas Rotich said Mungai&rsquo;s papers were in order, but Nyaberi had to bring the required documents.Nyaberi, who once worked as District Officer, had a letter from the Commission for University Education indicating that the University of Marathwada is recognised in Kenya.The letter, however, stated that the authenticity of his degree certificate can only be acknowledged upon production of the original copy. Addressing journalists at the regional IEBC office, Mungai termed the issue a small one that would be sorted by today. Mungai is running as an independent candidate. He will go back today to seek clearance.
