We expected a scorecard from a sitting government, not a manifesto, NASA co-principal Musalia Mudavadi has told Jubilee. He said the confusion bedevilling the Jubilee administration is an indicator that it has failed in steering the country to success, hence the need for its removal from power. Mudavadi was speaking in Kolalo grounds, Ugunja constituency, on Monday, during a NASA rally. He called for six-piece voting. Mudavadi said President Uhuru Kenyatta is scheming to form a grand coalition government with NASA after he sensed defeat in the election. NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga said the Jubilee government is a vehicle with a sleeping driver on the wheel. “[The] Jubilee government is like a vehicle [that one] does not know where the breaks and gears are,” he said. Raila said to demonstrate that Jubilee has failed, everything it puts its hands on fails, including the collapsed Sigiri Bridge in Budalang'i. Raila said the NASA manifesto is all-inclusive and revolves around ending the vicious cycle of poverty that has plagued the country for years. They were accompanied by governors Cornel Rasanga (Siaya), Sosepeter Ojamong (Busia) and Siaya Senator James Orengo, among others.
