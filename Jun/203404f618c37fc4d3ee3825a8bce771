Turkana Governor Josephat Nanok yesterday named Peter Lotethiro his running mate.Lotethiro has served as the Public Affairs officer at Tullow Oil Company. Deputy Governor Peter Ekai decamped to Jubilee Party last year after he differed with Nanok, who is the new Council of Governors chairman. Ekai is expected to be the running mate for Senator John Munyes, the Jubilee Party governor candidate.&ldquo;I am confident of winning because Turkana is an ODM stronghold,&rdquo; Nanok said.He added that his development record speaks for itself. The governor urged voters to give him a second term so he can continue with the projects he had started.&ldquo;For the four years I have been governor, development has been realised in Turkana. As we speak, we have laid a good platform to build the next five years.&rdquo;
