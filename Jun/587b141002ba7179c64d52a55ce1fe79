DPP Keriako Tobiko&rsquo;s office has said it has made good progress into the investigation into the killing of three children of Eldoret MCA aspirant James Ratemo.The three are Clifford Nyamweya, seven, Dan Nyamweya, five, and Glen Ongaki, three. They will be buried in Nyacheke, Kisii, on June 9.Their bodies were found in River Nzoia.&ldquo;We expect to complete investigations in the next five days and take return to court on June 6 with the suspect so far in police custody,&rdquo; state counsel Zachary Omwenga said.He says the charges of abduction against prime suspect Enock Onsase may be withdrawn so that he can face fresh charges of murder.But Omwenga described the ongoing probe as complex.&ldquo;This is a matter we are taking seriously. From what I have seen, police are doing a very good job,&rdquo; he told the Star on the phone yesterday.Omwenga said once investigations are complete, the file will be taken to the DPP&rsquo;s office for approval before Onsase is taken to court next Tuesday as directed by chief magistrate Charles Obulutsa.Police had requested for 10 days to complete the probe.Six people have recorded statements. &ldquo;Once we are through, we will know how many witnesses we have and the way forward,&rdquo; Omwenga said.The six include a key witness who claims to have seen Onsase with the children.They are said to have been crossing the streets in the town minutes after they were reported missing from Kapsoya Estate on May 13. Others who have recorded statements are Ratemo, his wife Ebby, the children&rsquo;s cousin and a caretaker at the Ratemos&rsquo; home in Kapsoya.Onsase, the children&rsquo;s uncle, is in police custody. &ldquo;All the family members required to record statements have done so and investigations are ongoing,&rdquo; family lawyer Charles Nyamweya said. Police are analysing mobile phone communications by Onsase to establish if other people were involved.A postmortem conducted at the Moi Referral Hospital showed the children were strangled.
