Canada has signed a pact with Kenya to fund a Sh1.5 billion programme that will increase skill and job opportunities for students in vocational institutions. The five-year Kenya Education For Employment Programme will be implemented by College and Institutes Canada in 10 national youth polytechnics and the Directorate of Technical and Vocational Education and Training will be the lead partner. Education ministry official Emily Maina said the programme will focus on agribusiness and the energy sector, with a view to increase economic opportunities for TVET graduates. “KEFEP will work with national polytechnics across Kenya to develop new or enhance competency-based programmes in the agriculture and energy sectors in order to increase employment and economic development opportunities,” she said. Maina spoke on Monday at the Nyeri National Polytechnic during a visit to the institution. Catherine Paquin, the senior programme officer for the Caribbean and Anglophone Africa, said the programme is meant to increase the effectiveness of TVET institutions in delivering accessible skills training programmes that meet industry needs.
