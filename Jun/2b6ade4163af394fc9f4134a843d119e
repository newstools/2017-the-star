Teachers of 12 schools in the former Kitale Municipality in Trans Nzoia are alarmed over the delayed increase in housing allowances that was to be effective from July 2015.They demand an explanation from the Teachers Service Commission.Through the Kenya Union of Post-Primary Education Teachers, they said colleagues in some schools receive extra pay, but many of them have been left out. This despite their schools falling within the area.&ldquo;Our teachers are struggling to meet the high costs of living,&rdquo; Trans Nzoia branch union chairman Eliud Wafula said in Kitale on Wednesday.He said teachers from the former municipality were to receive a higher housing allowance to meet high accommodation rates in the town.&ldquo;We noted some colleagues live in rural areas and teach in Kitale town and were not entitled to hardship allowances. It was difficult for them to commute daily from their homes to the schools,&rdquo; Wafula added.The schools include Kijana Wamalwa Memorial, St Joseph Boys&rsquo; National School, St Joseph Girls&rsquo;, Tuwan Girls&rsquo;, St Michael Top Station and St Patrick&rsquo;s High, Makunga.Others are AIC Naisambu Girls&rsquo;, Milimani Secondary School, Soil Conservation Secondary, St Augustine Secondary, Lessos AIC and St Monicah Girls&rsquo; High School.Wafula said the problem started when subcounties were created and some schools under Kitale were included in other subcounties, considered to be outside the municipality. He said St Monicah Girls High School which was initially in Kitale Municipality but now falls in Kwanza subcounty.
