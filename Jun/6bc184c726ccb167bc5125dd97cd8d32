Bank accounts belonging to the Kalonzo Musyoka Foundation will remain in operation until a suit challenging their closure is heard and determined.Justice Roseline Aburili has directed the NGO Coordination Board to respond to the suit within 21 days.The board through its director Mahamed Fazul had ordered the Central Bank to freeze the Foundation's accounts until further notice. This was over money laundering allegations, but the judge a fortnight ago issued temporary orders suspending the decision.&ldquo;The applicant [Foundation] is at liberty to file further affidavit within seven days thereafter,&rdquo; Aburili said. Parties who appeared before the judge yesterday for directions have also been directed to be back to court on June 30 to confirm compliance and take hearing dates.Some of the accusations include claims that the Foundation was unable to account for Sh196 million, including Sh50 million, from Chinese donors.In addition, Fazul accused the Foundation of &ldquo;continuously and consistently&rdquo; making false declarations of its financial status in the annual returns and audited accounts. &ldquo;The board has confirmed the existence of secret, illegal and unauthorised bank accounts, consisting both local and foreign accounts, in contravention and total disregard of the law,&rdquo; The NGOs Board further claimed the foundation&rsquo;s bank accounts were being operated by total strangers, contrary to the law.The foundation went to court, protesting the decision. It termed it illegal.In its suit filed through lawyer Albert Murambi, the foundation faulted the move on grounds it was done without a court order.The NGO Board, the lawyer said, acted unlawfully by insisting that it had followed all the necessary legal requirements."The respondent's conduct is irrational. Prior to the move, the applicant had complied with all the legal requirements and was issued with a certificate."The foundation is seeking several orders, among them prohibiting the board from deregistering it or in any way interfering with the rights of its officials "under the pretext of investigations".
