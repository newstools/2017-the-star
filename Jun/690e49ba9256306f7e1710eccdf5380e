NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga is facing resistance in his Bondo backyard as local elders refused to heed his call for the six-piece vote system in the region.Led by Otoyo Chiambe, the elders from the Nyismwa clan, one of the biggest clans in the region, said gone are the days when leaders would be imposed on the electorate in the guise of advancing party loyalty, irrespective of the demonstrated capability of the candidate seeking a seat.The elders spoke in the Migwena Cultural and Sports Grounds in the South Sakwa area yesterday, when independent Bondo MP aspirant John Andiwo Mwai launched his campaigns.Chiambe said the elders will show ODM voters hold the sovereign right to elect leaders of their choice, irrespective of party inclination.&ldquo;We want to tell ODM bigwigs the primaries were shambolic, so we have opted for independent candidates,&rdquo; he said.Chiambe said residents will vote &lsquo;overwhelmingly&rsquo; for Andiwo, Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo, who is vying for Siaya governor as an independent candidate, and Florence Aluodo, seeking the woman representative seat. He, however, assured Raila the elders will marshall support for him from independent candidates as he seeks to become President.Their sentiments come a few days after Raila led the NASA top brigade, comprising Kalonzo Musyoka, Musalia Mudavadi and Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula, to Bondo town on Sunday to promote the six-piece vote system.The rally attendees rejected Raila&rsquo;s call to support Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga.The elders said parties risk being rendered irrelevant &ldquo;if they are allowed to continue to condone malpractices that lead to losers being declared winners&rdquo;.
