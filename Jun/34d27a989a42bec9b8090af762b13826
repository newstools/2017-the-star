Wiper leaders in Ukambani have backed party chief Kalonzo Musyoka's calls for a six-piece vote in the region come election day.They said the region is focused on Kalonzo&rsquo;s 2022 presidential bid hence the need to strengthen Wiper in Machakos, Makueni and Kitui counties.This was in response to the recent incident where the NASA deputy president candidate did not endorse Narc's Charity Ngilu for Kitui governor.The leaders are Mavoko MP Patrick Makau, aspirants Jackson Kalla (Machakos senator), Joyce Kamene (woman representative) and Daniel Mbevi (Mlolongo MCA).Kalla said there is euphoria for Wiper in Ukambani where the former Vice President remains the political supremo.He said the party has gained popularity in the region since it conducted free and fair nominations compared to the shambolic 2013 primaries."We want to get more votes in the entire Ukambani region, including in Machakos and Makueni counties where we do not have Wiper governors," Kaila said."That is why it is not possible for Kalonzo to endorse Ngilu when the party has a candidate participating in the contest."Read: Ngilu&rsquo;s supporters shout down Malombe at Wiper rally, cheer Narc leader on stageMakau said promoting the voting pattern has been challenging but that the hope is for Wiper to win all seats in Ukambani."Kalonzo needs foot soldiers...we are glad the party is getting stronger as we approach the August 8 elections."The MP said the Wiper leader needs people in his team that he can control and noted it is good that Kenyans are mature and know what they want from their leaders."The future of any democracy is laid on party structures. We are headed there."Mbevi said Kenya's politics is zoned hence the need for candidates from various areas to respect the peoples' decision on nominations.They spoke on Wednesday during the commissioning of CDF-funded laboratory and tuition blocks at St Augustine Mlolongo High School in Mavoko
