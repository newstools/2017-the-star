Sub-Saharan Africa remains the region with the highest mortality rate of children under five years, with one child in 12 dying before his or her fifth birthday &mdash; far higher than the average ratio of one in 147 in high-income countries. In Part Two of the maternal health series, we seek to find out the causes of infant mortality and what needs to be done &mdash; and has already been done &mdash; to reduce these numbers.Vulnerable first 28 days of baby&rsquo;s lifeThe first 28 days of life &mdash; the neonatal period &mdash; are the most vulnerable time for a child&rsquo;s survival. Most of the deaths of children under five occur during the neonatal period.The health interventions needed to prevent these deaths differ from those needed to address other under-five deaths as they are closely linked to those that are necessary to protect maternal health. For too many babies, their day of birth is also their day of death.Worldwide, almost one million neonatal deaths occur on the day of birth, and close to two million die in the first week of life.The leading causes of the under-five deaths are infectious diseases or conditions such as pneumonia, diarrhoea, malaria, meningitis, tetanus, HIV or measles.Almost half of all under-five deaths are attributable to undernutrition, while more than 80 per cent of neonatal deaths occur among newborn infants with low birth weight.In Kenya, according to the 2014 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey, the child mortality rate is 52 children out of every 1,000 born, implying that at least one in every 19 children born in Kenya died before reaching their fifth birthday.Mosquito nets save livesThe infant mortality rate is 39 deaths per 1,000 live births. That fewer children are dying is attributed to the increased use of mosquito nets and by improvements in maternal health, including increases in the proportion of births assisted by a skilled provider and delivered in a health facility and increases in postnatal care.Kenya also ranks second to last in the countries with the highest number of stillbirths. In 2015, 1,571,032 babies were born. Of these, 23 out of every 1,000 live births were stillborn.We set out to look at the data available to get an indication, which counties presented newborns with the worst prospects of surviving to their fifth birthday and the causes of death.Pneumonia the number one killer of childrenNationwide, the most common killers of infants and children under five years are malaria, diarrhoeal diseases and pneumonia (acute respiratory infections).Malaria kills 11.6 per cent of Kenyan infants and children; pneumonia ( 10.9 per cent) of all registered deaths and less than five per cent die from diarrhoeal diseases. HIV-Aids causes 15 per cent of deaths of children under the age of five.More children ( 16 per cent) in Vihiga county die from acute respiratory diseases than any other county in Kenya. Acute Respiratory Infection is a proxy for pneumonia, the number one killer of children in Kenya.Diarrhoea kills infantsTwenty-four per cent of children in Homa Bay and Vihiga suffered from diarrhoea, an infection that the Ministry of Health ranks high as a cause for children&rsquo;s mortality due to dehydration.A child born in Nyanza is twice as likely to die before age five than a child born in Central. Nyanza region has the highest mortality rate of children under five years &mdash; 84 deaths per 1,000 live births &mdash; followed by Nairobi ( 72 deaths per 1,000 live births) and Western 64:1,000. Central records the lowest ( 42 ).Diseases that are readily preventable or treatable with proven, cost-effective interventions, cause most of these child deaths. County governments in particular have a huge responsibility in ensuring that they allocate resources to expanding effective preventive and curative interventions.What needs to be doneTo reduce the rate of maternal deaths, the government needs to achieve universal access to sexual, reproductive, maternal and newborn care, and midwifery services to respond to the 2.8 million pregnancies per annum by 2030. Majority of these, 73 per cent, will be women who are in rural settings.The health system implications include how best to configure and equitably deploy the sexual, reproductive, maternal and newborn workforce to cover at least 194.4 million antenatal visits, 32.8 million births and 131.3 million post-partum/postnatal visits between 2012 and 2030.What the state has donePresident Uhuru Kenyatta launched the free maternity services programme in June 2013 to improve the state of reproductive health in the country.It was hoped that cases of pregnant women being turned away for lack of admission fees would become a thing of the past.It was also hoped cases of women being illegally detained at hospitals after delivering for their inability to pay their bill would stop and that the overall state of maternity care would improve.There have been some gains in the four years the programme has run the scheme.Between 2013 and the end of 2016, reports estimate that 2.3 million women had benefited from the initiative, at a cost of close to Sh12 billion.These women got access to theatre and midwife services, medication, as well as access to free counselling and family planning options.However, it has not all been rosy as there are still cases reported of women being detained after delivering and others being denied admission and either dying while giving birth away from hospital, or their babies dying during delivery.The Constitution states that every person has a right to the highest attainable standard of health, which includes reproductive health services.Under the free maternity care service programme, each government facility was to be paid Sh5,000 for each baby delivered.In June 2014, then Health Cabinet Secretary James Macharia said that the government had increased the allocation for free maternity care from Sh3.4 billion to Sh4 billion &ldquo;in an attempt to consolidate the gains made since the programme was started&rdquo;.Macharia announced that women seeking antenatal and postnatal care from hospitals increased from 44 to 66 per cent, allowing healthcare workers to arrest any complications that may threaten the life of the baby or the mother earlier, and plan early interventions.But in 2016, the state announced county governments would no longer receive cash to cover the free maternity programme as the government would channel the funds through the National Hospital Insurance Fund. This was to improve efficiency and accountability. But some women still complained of difficulties accessing free services.In October last year, the government launched the &lsquo;Linda Mama, Boresha Jamii Programme&rsquo; to improve free maternity services. Beyond Zero campaignThe Beyond Zero campaign was launched by First Lady Margaret Kenyatta in 2014 to provide every county with a mobile clinic equipped to handle emergency obstetric services. This was in a bid to end infant and maternal mortality and reduce mother-to-child transmission of HIV.This month when taking stock of Phase One of the Beyond Zero campaign that ran since 2014, the First Lady noted the achievements made, saying that more than 2,000 maternal deaths had been averted annually as new child infections dropped by half.&ldquo;It is encouraging to note that out of the 79,000 HIV-positive pregnant women in 2015, there were only 6,600 new child infections, a 50 per cent drop from 12,000 in 2013,&rdquo; the First Lady said. About Sh43.6 billion would be required to launch the second phase of the Beyond Zero campaign.In the final instalment of this three-part series on maternal health series, we will look at the interventions that are available, including vaccines, to improve a child&rsquo;s chances of surviving beyond their fifth birthday.
