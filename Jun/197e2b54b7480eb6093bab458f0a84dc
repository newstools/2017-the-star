Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero has dismissed Senator Mike Sonko's "theatrics" as the two head for a heated battle in the August 8 polls."Nairobi is not a town for circuses...ni ya wale watu wamekomaa (it's for people who are mature). We do not have to shout like some people who, if they give Sh10, call the media to capture what they are doing," the Governor said on Tuesday.Kidero also defended his record saying he has fulfilled most of his 2013 pledges despite frustration and sabotage by the national government.The Governor said despite a skewed revenue allocation formula and a Sh72 billion debt owed by the national government, he has initiated many development projects in the capital."We have done roads, hospitals...17 dispensaries are now 24-hour...we have built maternity and modern mortuary facilities at Mbagathi, modernised City mortuary, built an inpatient hospital in Mutuini...and schools," he said.&ldquo;We pay salaries of Sh1.3 billion every month, which translates to around Sh15 billion per year, yet we only get around Sh13 billion every year from the national government."He spoke to journalists after meeting more than 1,000 NASA women leaders from Westlands.Read: I'm not scared of Sonko - KideroAlso read: Sonko not popular in city and I&rsquo;ll show him that in polls - KideroKidero called for peaceful elections saying Nairobi residents and communities need to co-exist peacefully."Nairobi has 42 tribes whose members live in peace.
