A Nation media journalist based in Baringo has threatened to sue Senator Gideon Moi for copyright and threats to his life.Cheboite Kigen claims Gideon picked a photograph he took with him in 2014 and used it on his campaign posters without his consent."Every time I attempt to meet him to discuss the matter, his personal assistant Peter Chelang'a blocks me and threatens to beat me up.Last week, Kigen said he attempted to greet the Senator during a rally in Barwessa but was blocked and threatened against covering any more of his events.He said the Kanu chairman's PA has been sending him threats by SMS."I have since moved to Kabarnet town fearing for my life, not knowing the eventualities. I have reported the matter to police," he said.He told the Star on Wednesday that Chelang'a has even declined to record statement as the matter is "petty".Chelang'a claims the journalist was paid for the photo but is demanding more money."I think he is being used by our opponents to tarnish the Senator's name. We have given him some cash for appreciation in the past," he said.Gideon is facing a stiff battle from former Betting Control and Licensing Director Simon Chelugui.Meanwhile, comedian Cornelius Sergon, 29, has claimed he lost his contract with KTN for supporting Chelugui."Only because I was adamant to support the Senator, Nakuru bureau chief Alex Kiprotich effected my sacking," Sergon told The Star in Kabarnet town on Tuesday.He said he was acting in a programme called 'Jameni' before his contract was terminated last Month.Kiprotich disputed the claims saying Sergon's contract ended under proper circumstances."I don't have any issue with anybody. In fact, I am not even aware of Sergon's situation because his case was dealt with in Nairobi."
