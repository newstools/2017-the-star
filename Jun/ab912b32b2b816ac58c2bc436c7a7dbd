The magistrate&rsquo;s court will hear an attempted murder case against former minister Mbiyu Koinange&rsquo;s widow Eddah Wanjiru and son David Njuno.The High Court declined to bar their prosecution for the attempted murder of Moses ole Mpoe&rsquo;s brother Joseph Kakore Mpoe.Chief magistrate Geoffrey Oduor said, &ldquo;The accused defence lawyers should be supplied with witness statements and any other document that will be used in the case.&rdquo;The widow, her son Njuno, alongside Nicholas Ng&rsquo;etich, Johnstone Sigei, Stephen Mwanga, Sanaga Mbukoi and Kiragu Macharia are charged at the lower court with the attempted murder of Joseph. They went to the High Court to challenge their trial.On November 7 last year, Justice Maureen Odero refused to grant orders to stop the trial against the two as requested by their lawyer Gordon Ogola.The judge instead directed that the trial before the lower court proceeds without delay.In his application, Ogola asked the court to terminate the case at the subordinate court after the High Court acquitted them in December 2014, where they were accused of the murder of Moses and Paarsayia ole Kitu on December 3, 2010.Moses and his brother Joseph were shot by a hitman on a motorcycle on December 3, 2010, at Silo Junction on the Nakuru-Eldoret highway.Joseph survived the assassin&rsquo;s six bullets which left him with a left eye injury.Representing the accused, advocate Karanja Mbugua and Ogola said the defence is ready to proceed with the case once they are supplied with witness statements and other documents.Prosecutor Hillary Songoyo told the court the prosecution is ready to present its case against the accused.The case will be heard on August 25 and 26.
