Safaricom has began roll out of data to different businesses through a consumer wallet by startup research firm mSurvey following their partnership in March.Consumer wallet, a versatile mobile platform, is expected to quantify offline consumer spending habits and trends, and condense the data into different categories. The analytics will later be customised for use by different businesses in line with their requirements.&ldquo;Due to the inadequate information on consumer habit spending, we want to help businesses make positive decision in the market to help them grow as we move from being a traditional telco to a solution provider in the different sectors of the economy,&rdquo; Safaricom senior manager for research and insights Paul Omondi said.He said the data gathered will also be shared with the government in order to help solve key challenges ranging from traffic to housing and food consumption.The data is divided into three categories &ndash; basic, brand and analytics &ndash; and will be released on a quarterly basis. The brand and analytics segment will be sold to different businesses, while the basic data will be distributed free of charge.Contents of the data will include demographics on age and consumer spending habits.
