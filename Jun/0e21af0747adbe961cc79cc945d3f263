The Mombasa Council of Elders yesterday announced it will support President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s reelection for the &ldquo;massive development initiated by Jubilee&rdquo;.Chairman Mohamed Jahazi cited construction of the second berth at the Port of Mombasa and the standard gauge railway, and the revival of the Mtongwe Channel Crossing.He said Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto deserve a second term because they have resettled the landless, bought a new ferry and issued title deeds to Coast residents.The MV Jambo Mombasa will be arrive from Turkey later this month before its unveiling on June 27.&ldquo;Despite the ICC cases hanging heavy over their shoulder, the two were able to do this much. What about when they are free?&rdquo; Jahazi said.He spoke during a media briefing at the Royal Castle Hotel. Jahazi said it is childish for one to claim that port operations will be transferred to Naivasha through the establishment of a dry port. Governor Hassan Joho and opposition leaders have warned that setting up a dry port in Naivasha will destroy Mombasa&rsquo;s economy, which heavily relies on the port.
