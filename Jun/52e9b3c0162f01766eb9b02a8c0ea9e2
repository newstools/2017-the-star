Flavian Mutiva and Audrey Omaido each scored a brace to help high flying Telkom Orange win 6-0 against Jomo Kenyatta University Agriculture Technology in a Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) women&rsquo;s premier league match at the City Park Stadium yesterday.With the result, the 19-time local champions, extended their unbeaten run to eight games and currently lead the standing with 24 points from eight matches.Two goals each from Omaido (6th,41st) and Mutiva (26th, 57th) respectively and a goal each from Jackline Mwangi (8th) and Betsy Omala(51st), were enough for the champions to record another win, barely three days after humiliating Sliders 8-0 last Wednesday.Jos Openda&rsquo;s charges piled pressure in the opponents half from the whistle and their efforts bored fruits barely six minutes into the match, thanks to Omaido&rsquo;s field goal.Two minutes later, Mwangi was on the mark with the second goal for 2-0 lead in the first quarter after combining well with Rachael Ousa. Sensing defeat, JKUAT&rsquo;s coach Sammy Oungo reverted to combative approach to try and contain the sharp opponents but his move backfired with Mutiva making it three up heading into the breather.On resumption, Orange picked up from, where they had left with Omaido tapping in Maureen Okumu&rsquo;s short corner taken short corner by fast-improving Okumu in the 41st minute. An unmanned Ann Mwangi would have pulled one back for the students in the 49th minute in a one-on-one attempt but the Orange goalkeeper Ruth Njoki was equal to the challenge. Omala scored in the 51st minute through a penalty corner to make it 5-0 before Mutiva completed her double in the 57th minute to seal the win for the champions.Josephine Ataro lauded her charges saying: &ldquo;They played well but we need to work on the short corners more to increase our chances. I am pleased with the win and the discipline of the girls.&rdquo;JKUATS coach Sammy Oungo said: &ldquo;We played a strong team with a good fighting spirit. We tried by all means to stop them but they were equally sharp. We hope to bounce back in next match.&rdquo;This was JKUAT&rsquo;s second loss in eight games.
