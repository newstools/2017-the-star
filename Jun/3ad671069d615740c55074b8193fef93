Some 102 residents of Kirinyaga have sued to stop former Devolution CS Anne Waiguru from being barred from holding public office over the multimillion-shilling NYS scandal.The residents are seeking an order to block any state organ from relying on the National Assembly Public Accounts Committee report on the Sh791 million NYS scandal, or even its implementation.They believe the PAC findings and recommendations are aimed at depriving Waiguru of her right to equal protection of the law and right to free, fair and regular elections based on the free will of electors.The residents say the people have a right to elect a leader of their choice.Waiguru is running for Kirinyaga governor.The residents, led by Charles Kariuki, accused the PAC of being unfair to Waiguru because it did not give her a fair chance to cross-examine all the witnesses who appeared before it in relation to the scandal.The court was further told that the PAC, in recommending barring Waiguru from holding public office, unlawfully assumed the powers of the EACC.The residents have sued the National Assembly, Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, Directorate of Criminal Investigations and the Attorney General.The case comes less than a week after Waiguru filed a similar one at the High Court.In her suit papers, Waiguru said the PAC decision was arrived at unlawfully and in total disregard of evidence adduced before it. The report in question arose out of a request by the National Assembly clerk to the Auditor General to conduct special audit of the National Youth Service.The Auditor General prepared the report in May 2016, which was adopted the PAC.
