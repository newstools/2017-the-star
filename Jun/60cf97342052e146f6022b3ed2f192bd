It was a good idea when the national government decided to take National Day celebrations out of capital city Nairobi and to the counties, acknowledging the fact of devolution.It was also fitting that one of the leading presidential candidates, NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga, was on the VIP podium for the 54th Madaraka Day fete in Kabiruini Grounds, Nyeri county, yesterday.However, not only was there no official acknowledgement of Raila&rsquo;s presence by the speakers who preceded President Uhuru&rsquo;s Address to the Nation, he was not invited to greet the gathering and the country.It is only 66 days to the August 8 General Election and the political temperature can only rise during the terrific campaigns that lie ahead. More officially inclusive joint appearances and appeals for peaceful polls can only be good for national cohesiveness.Uhuru, the former Prime Minister and the six other presidential candidates should make joint public appearances as often as possible in the run-up to Election Day.And they should remind Kenyans that elections come and go, but the nation is bigger than the sum of its parts.
