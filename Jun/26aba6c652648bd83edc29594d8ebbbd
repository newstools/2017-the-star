When Mwawana&rsquo;s older brother arrived, the suspect had already chopped off the boys private parts and changed his clothes," Mngola said."The child reported that he was feeling pain on his private parts and when the uncle removed his clothes they were shocked to realise that he had been attacked.&rdquo;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s sad that until this morning the boy&rsquo;s body parts had not been recovered. The mentally ill uncle could not remember where he placed them,&rdquo; said Mngola.Mwawana, who is mentally ill, went missing immediately after he committed the crime.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s sad that until this morning the boy&rsquo;s body parts had not been recovered.
