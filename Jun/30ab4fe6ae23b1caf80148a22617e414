On June 3, the Afro Pop Festival featured rapper Barak Jacuzzi, who was the opening act at the Omarion concert. Being the first one on stage, he certainly had to deliver, and certainly, he did.The rapper, who also goes by the moniker the Coco Ma$ta, proved he was full of energy and life by offering one of the night&rsquo;s electrifying displays.AMERICAN ACCENTThe Kenyan-American rapper grew up in Columbia, and that would explain his rich American accent. He is based in Kenya and holds other significant titles as a radio host and hype man.Barak first came into the scene when he featured in the Nokia Don&rsquo;t Break A Beat cypher, and at his own preferred rate, he has gradually built his name as a multi-talented entertainer.It is safe to assume that his music style is greatly influenced by the American sound. While some might view him as a typical wannabe, in his defence, it might be the right time for him to make his kind of music.THE BEST?2017 has been a good year for Barak, having released his biggest project, The Juice Bar mixtape. He has also collaborated with Octopizzo and Boutross on one of the biggest trap tracks of the year, Tergat Gang.When he released the track No Ad Libs, it was clear he is breaking out of his shell, bragging in his raps: &ldquo;See I&rsquo;m the best, why you think O picked me?&rdquo; The Juice Bar would prove to be a giant step, giving the artist an opportunity to be considered in a major festival&rsquo;s lineup.With his latest works, the entertainer is certainly looking forward to better days. He is getting stronger and more visible to the local scene, a clear indication that he is out to make an impact with his music.Every artiste&rsquo;s destiny is dependent on his fans, and it&rsquo;s up to Barak to keep giving his fans more &ldquo;Juice&rdquo;.
