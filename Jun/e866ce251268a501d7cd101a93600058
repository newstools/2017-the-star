A man from Kapchepkisa village, Baringo North subcounty, succumbed to injuries after he was beaten by a mob &ldquo;for being drunk and disorderly&rdquo;.Reuben Kipkulei, 38, was beaten last Tuesday and died on Thursday night. His body was still in his mud-walled house when the media visited his family on Sunday.The family said the village elders ordered the beating as a form of disciplinary action.Kipkulei&rsquo;s brother, Alfred Kulei, told the press a group of more than 20 youths beat him and said the elders had ordered them to do so &ldquo;because he was a drunk&rdquo;.He said the youths threatened to kill him if he dared try to rescue his brother.&ldquo;They tied him on his bed until morning and left him with severe injuries all over his body,&rdquo; Kipkulei said.He said the youths returned on Wednesday morning, beat him again in front of the elders and warned him to stop drinking or they would kill him.Elder Joseph Chepchieng said punishing a wrongdoer is part of the Tugen culture, but added the incident was extreme.Kipkulei&rsquo;s mother, Prisca Kobilo, said she tried to save her son, but they threatened and chased her away as they threw sticks at her.&ldquo;My son complained of abdominal pain the previous evening, but I screamt when I found him dead on Friday morning when I went to serve him breakfast,&rdquo; she said.Kobilo said the youths are notorious, but the police have not arrested them.She said, &ldquo;Even Bartolimo chief Nicolas Kibowen, who lives 100 metres away, is yet to take action.&rdquo; Toroitich Mengich, Kipkulei&rsquo;s uncle, said it is unfair the authorities are yet to take up the matter. He urged the government to take action.
