Jubilee candidates for Nairobi&rsquo;s top seats yesterday accused Governor Evans Kidero of running down health facilities.Woman representative Rachel Shebesh and Senate aspirant Johnson Sakaja said Kidero has failed to provide basic healthcare services &ldquo;causing undue suffering to the city&rsquo;s poor&rdquo;. They spoke at PCEA Umoja.Shebesh said Sonko has provided medical care through his Sonko Rescue Team because Kidero&rsquo;s administration has failed to provide medical supplies to hospitals.&ldquo;Sonko, who has no funds for buying medicine, has set up clinics in slums, while health centres under the county government have no medicine. Stop cheap politics, you are the governor, we are not going to entertain side shows,&rdquo; she said. Shebesh continued, &ldquo;We are offering this [medical care] under the governorship of Sonko, medical care for the people of Nairobi because we know with the more than Sh1 billion collected, we will have enough money to provide medical supplies.&rdquo; Sakaja said Kidero is &ldquo;a mere distraction before Sonko&rsquo;s governorship because he has spent four years showing how badly a county government can perform&rdquo;.
