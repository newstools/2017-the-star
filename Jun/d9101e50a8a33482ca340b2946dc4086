Mastercard and Western Union have partnered to develop a digital platform for refugees to access funds within their settlements.The model, the two said in a statement, will allow refugees do digital transactions amongst themselves, their host countries and donors, creating more transparency and long-term empowerment.&ldquo;The new digital infrastructure model will focus on solutions that might include the delivery of mobile money, digital vouchers, prepaid cards, and track other goods and services,&rdquo; head of customer relationship management at Western Union Maureen Sigliano said. &ldquo;The goal is to drive personal empowerment, stimulate growth and promote social cohesion among the world&rsquo;s refugee populations, while driving better governance and transparency.&rdquo;KaKuma Refugee camp in northern Kenya, which currently hosts more than 162,000 refugees, has one bank branch and five bank agents, according to a report by the two firms titled Smart Communities: Using Digital Technology to create Sustainable Refugee Economies.Mastercard and Western Union have developed a blueprint that would combine digital access to remittances, banking, education, healthcare and other basic needs in a way that can be tracked.&ldquo;Our plans to reinvent the existing model can help the world&rsquo;s refugee populations achieve self-sufficiency faster, while also contributing to the economic growth of their host communities,&rdquo; executive vice president of public-private partnerships at Mastercard Tara Nathan said.The blueprint will help in laying the groundwork for a set of multipurpose transactional tools that refugees and residents can access, which are optimized to work in low infrastructure areas.
