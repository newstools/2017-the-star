A new study has found that a vegetarian diet not only helps lose weight more effectively than conventional low-calorie diets, but may also improve the metabolism by reducing muscle fat.Researchers looked at 74 participants with type 2 diabetes, who were randomly assigned either a vegetarian diet or a conventional anti-diabetic diet. The vegetarian diet was made up of vegetables, grains, legumes, fruits and nuts, with animal products limited to a portion of low-fat yoghurt per day. Both diets were restricted to 500 kilocalories a day.The vegetarian diet was found to be almost twice as effective in reducing body weight, with an average loss of 6.2kg compared to 3.2kg.Lead author Dr Hana Kahleov&aacute;, director of clinical research at the physicians committee for responsible medicine in Washington DC, said: &ldquo;Losing muscle fat improves glucose and lipid metabolism, so this finding is particularly important for people with metabolic syndrome and type two diabetes.&rdquo;Type two diabetes is a major issue for Kenyans, with the WHO estimating prevalence at 3.3 per cent and predicting a rise to 4.5 per cent by 2025.Furthermore, a health survey found that 28 per cent of men and 36 per cent of women in Kenya are at risk of obesity-related illnesses, which, in addition to diabetes, include high blood pressure, respiratory problems, infertility, heart disease and cancer.The study looked at how the two diets affected subcutaneous, subfascial and intramuscular fat; fat under the skin, surface of the muscles and inside the muscles.They found that although both diets caused a similar reduction in subcutaneous fat, subfascial only reduced in the vegetarian diet and intramuscular fat was more reduced with the vegetarian options.Dr Kahleov&aacute; said: &ldquo;What we found is that a plant-based vegetarian diet is a helpful tool for anyone serious about staying healthy and lean, especially as we age.&ldquo;A diet built around plants is naturally rich in fibre, vitamins, minerals and phytochemicals, which leaves us feeling energised and refreshed, instead of hungry and fatigued.&ldquo;Part of the reason a vegetarian diet works so well for many people is because it&rsquo;s easy to stick to.&rdquo;Kenyans are well known meat-eaters, and research has shown that we eat the most meat in East Africa, particularly beef. However, with an increase in obesity-related illnesses, it may be time to look closer at our meat consumption.Red meats, in particular, are high in saturated fats, which raise blood cholesterol, increasing the risk of heart disease. Beef, lamb and pork have also been found to increase susceptibility to stroke, infections and kidney, liver and lung diseases.A study by the National Institute of Health-AARP found that people who ate a lot of red meat and processed meat over a 10-year period were likely to die sooner than those who ate smaller amounts.Furthermore, obesity does not only affect our lives, but also puts a burden on our health care system.While it is unrealistic to expect a country of meat lovers, myself included, to change their diets, even just reducing the amount of meat we eat can make a difference in our health.Eating more white meat, combined with regular exercise, can go a long way in the quest to lose weight and get healthy and even result in the reversal of type 2 diabetes.As with all things health related, moderation and portion sizes is key. There is nothing wrong with enjoying some nyama choma every once in a while, as long as you are smart about it and keep active.
