The High Court has ordered IEBC to explain why it disqualified presidential aspirant Solomon Gichira Last week, Gichira was charged with attempted suicide, malicious damage to property and creating disturbance following his altercation with IEBC officials and police officers at Anniversary Towers in Nairobi. He denied the charges and was released on Sh200,000 cash bail but moved to court to be allowed to submit signatures of those who nominated him. The nominations deadline is June 9. More on this: Presidential aspirant Solomon Gichira charged with attempting suicide Justice George Odunga ordered on Monday that the commission file sworn statements by Tuesday and set an inter-parties hearing for Wednesday. Odunga further said Gichira was at liberty to file responses to the replying affidavits lodged by the IEBC to facilitate urgent hearings. The IEBC locked Gichira out of the election as he did not submit the requirements. He was time-barred and failed to present a list of at least 48,000 supporters in electronic format. In his application, the aspirant says he will likely be excluded from the election and accuses the IEBC of deliberately disobeying court orders allowing him to submit the contentious papers. He wants the commission blocked from making any further preparations for the poll, including printing ballot papers, pending the outcome of his petition. On May 17, the judge nullified restrictions imposed by the IEBC, for independent presidential candidates to enlist supporters who no political affiliations. The court also mullified the requirement for aspirants to submit signatures of 2,000 nominees from 24 counties through electronic format. He said the restrictions were discriminatory.
