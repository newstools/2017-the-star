Anthony Mureithi of Directorate of Criminal investigations&rsquo; has joined the Team Kenya shooting team, which jet off tomorrow to compete in the ongoing United Kingdom Imperial Bisley Meeting.Mureithi replaces Edward Legei as the team adjutant. This development brings the total number of marksmen to 16 from 15 as Legei travels to the Stickledown Range as a firer and not a team official. However, uncertainty surrounds the traveling of the four shooters from the DCI including John Serem, Elphas Ngetich, Philip Kipchumba and Mureithi after their primary funder, DCI, withdrew their support due to operational engagements.The national full-bore captain Wilberforce Kerema said the office of the Inspector General is exploring possibility of sponsoring the DCI party to the 148th edition of the UK Imperial Bisley shoot. &ldquo;The IG is looking into the prospects of funding us alongside the other 12. We are hoping for the best,&rdquo; noted Kerema.He added: &ldquo;The three trigger pullers are part of our best and the UK Bisley provides them with a great opportunity to sharpen their skills, and exchange knowledge with top shooters from around the world.&rdquo;Team Kenya is slated to join the advance party comprising of team manager (police commissioner) Anthony Kamitu and John Sichei tomorrow and start their campaign on Thursday.
