Jubilee party will file an urgent appeal against the ruling on the announcement of presidential results at the constituency level, Devolution CS Mwangi Kiunjuri said.The Court of Appeal made the ruling on Friday in what is seen as a win for the Opposition.It ruled that IEBC's returning officers posted in the 290 constituencies must electronically transmit presidential results to the national tallying centre in Nairobi.IEBC on Saturday said it will not appeal the ruling and is committed to delivering credible election results on August 8.Read: NASA wins case on tallying, suffers setback on printingBut Kiunjuri protested the ruling saying "it is as if the court wants to see this country on fire"."We as Jubilee will not accept the Court of Appeal ruling," he told residents in Turkana on Saturday.He said the ruling will trigger confusion, which would lead to chaos after the polls.He said it would be almost impossible to ensure that all constituency officers remain unbiased, adding that the court had not assessed the consequences of not allowing the IEBC chair to be the one to announce the final presidential polls results."If county returning officers work under instructions from either Jubilee or NASA and announce different results, the IEBC will have no mandate to verify and alter them,&rdquo; the CS said.His sentiments were echoed by Turkana Jubilee governor candidate John Munyes who said the elections would be marred with confusion if the ruling is adhered to.
