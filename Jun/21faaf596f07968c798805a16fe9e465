A Kuresoi South Kanu MP aspirant has accused Kenya Power of distributing faulty transformers in the area.Bruce Chitalu told journalists on Saturday that most of the transformers dispatched to the area are not working.The equipment was channeled to the constituency under the Jubilee Administration's last mile connectivity project."It is unfortunate that leaders close to President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto are quiet over the issue.""Locals are suffering. Several schools have no electricity while the government claims that they have connected them," Bruce said.The former police officer asked Energy CS Charles Keter to look into the matter saying it is a let-down for Jubilee."We were once told that Keter was to come and supervise the project, where is he?" the politician asked.He said the failed projects in the county is among the reasons he will not heed Ruto's calls that he steps down from the race.Read: Ruto asks Kanu's Kuresoi South MP candidate to quit for JubileeChitalu is contesting against incumbent Zakayo Cheruiyot who is defending his seat on CCM party - a NASA affiliate.Chama cha Mashinani is led by Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto.
