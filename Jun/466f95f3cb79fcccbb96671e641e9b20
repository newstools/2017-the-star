NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga is free to campaign and seek votes in Bondo town, but not in the company of the Siaya Governor, Cornel Rasanga, the transport association has said.The association, comprising boda-boda, pick-up and heavy commercial vehicle operators, denied claims they have been jeering and humiliating Raila every time he visits Bondo town in an attempt to drum up support for Rasanga&rsquo;s reelection bid.Association officials Fredrick Agolla(chairman), Oliver Akach (deputy chairman), Dennis Owiti (secretary) and Samuel Lenya (assistant secretary) said they have no problem with Raila visiting to campaign for himself. Agolla said voters have their reservations about Rasanga. Last week, Raila had a hard time trying to campaign for Rasanga under the six-piece vote pattern. The transport union said the county has done little to improve operators&rsquo; lives.
