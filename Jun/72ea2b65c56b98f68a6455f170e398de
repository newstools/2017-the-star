Murang&rsquo;a JP leaders &lsquo;selfishly&rsquo; focussed on non-issues and protocol and failed to get help for residents in President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s backyard when he visited.That&rsquo;s what unhappy residents had to say when Uhuru did not deliver a big basket of goodies. They blame JP politicians for bickering.Resident Kamau Waithira said the county missed out on the President&rsquo;s goodies &mdash; dished out to other counties &mdash; because leader argued overs irrelevant issues, such as who should attend the big meeting on Wednesday. &ldquo;It was shocking and disappointing that what was meant to be a meeting to strategise at Blue Post Hotel turned out to be a shouting match between Jubilee nominees and independents,&rdquo; he said.Kamau said that as a result, the President only talked about completed projects &mdash; water projects, infrastructure development and coffee [levy] waiver.&ldquo;Our leaders failed us by not stating our needs. We are yet to even receive subsidised maize flour, but we blame Jubilee nominees for being selfish with our President, making him not even show up for the meeting,&rdquo; he said.Wambui Kamau from Kigumo said, &ldquo;We are President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s bloc [stronghold]. We have seen him travel to other counties, bail out farmers, compensate IDPs and [address] other issues in the regions. But he did not come with the basket [here] ... All this is because our leaders were busy focussing on non-issues.&rdquo;In Kahaini, Kandara, Uhuru pledged to help integrated IDPs.Residents also expressed disappointment the President did not tour all the areas he was scheduled to visit.Uhuru and DP William Ruto were to start the tour at the Blue Post Hotel, Gatanga, stop in 16 towns and finally address a rally at Ihura Stadium.However, they mainly toured Murang&rsquo;a South &mdash; Gatanga, Kandara, Kigumo and Maragua. In Murang&rsquo;a North, the President only visited Mukuyu and Murang&rsquo;a towns in Kiharu constituency.Huge crowds in other places waited all day for him, to no avail.
