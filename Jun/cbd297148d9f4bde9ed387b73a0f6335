Sirisia MP John Waluke has said Water CS Eugene Wamalwa will be Deputy President Willam Ruto&rsquo;s running mate in 2022.He said Luhya MPs who back Jubilee want someone from the community to be Ruto&rsquo;s running mate.&ldquo;That is the easiest way the Luhya community can ascend to power and not through the opposition NASA, which is offering the community nonexistent positions,&rdquo; Waluke said yesterday in Eldoret. He said it is &ldquo;clear&rdquo; President Uhuru Kenyatta will be reelected. &ldquo;Right now we are through with the 2017 election because Uhuru is going to be reelected. We are now working on 2022 and our plan is to have Ruto take over with Wamalwa as his running mate,&rdquo; Waluke said. He said Luhyas shouldn&rsquo;t &ldquo;be duped into supporting NASA&rdquo;.
