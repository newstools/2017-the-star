German MPs are expected to vote to legalise same-sex marriage, days after Chancellor Angela Merkel dropped her opposition to the idea.The reform would give gay men and lesbians full marital rights, and allow them to adopt children.At present, German same-sex couples are limited to civil unions.On Monday Merkel, who previously opposed a vote on gay marriage, said she would allow MPs from her CDU party to "follow their conscience".During her 2013 election campaign, Angela Merkel argued against gay marriage on the grounds of "children's welfare," and admitted that she had a "hard time" with the issue.But at an event hosted by the women's magazine "Brigitte" on 26 June, she shocked the German media by announcing on stage that she had noted other parties' support for it, and would allow a free vote in the future.The usually-cautious chancellor said she had had a "life-changing experience" in her home constituency, where she had dinner with a lesbian couple who cared for eight foster children together.As the news spread on Twitter, supporters rallied under the hashtag #EheFuerAlle (MarriageForAll) - and started calling for a vote as soon as possible.A recent survey by the government's anti-discrimination agency found that 83% of Germans are in favour of marriage equality.The day after the Republic of Ireland voted to legalise gay marriage in May 2015, almost every German newspaper splashed a rainbow across its front page."It's time, Merkel" Green party leader Katrin Goering-Eckhart exclaimed then. "The Merkel faction cannot just sit out the debate on marriage for everyone."Germans go to the polls on 24 September, and the sudden Merkel turnaround will deprive her opponents of a campaign issue.The Greens, the far-left Linke, and the pro-business Free Democrats all back same-sex marriage. In fact, they have refused to enter a future coalition deal unless reform is agreed on.Merkel's current coalition partners - the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) - have done the same.The right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) is now the only party to oppose same-sex marriage.Conservatives within Mrs Merkel's party, the Christian Democrats (CDU), are against a change in the law, however.They have argued that a gay marriage bill would require a change to the constitution, and that marriage between a man and a woman should enjoy special protection.The CDU's Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), has also expressed opposition.Its members champion "traditional" families - and pragmatist Mrs Merkel needs their votes in the September election.Commentators say this partly explains why she has rejected a vote on marriage equality until now.Amid a groundswell of public support for a vote, Merkel's rivals have moved to capitalise politically.A day after her comments, the SDP's candidate for the chancellorship Martin Schulz declared - "we will take her at her word," and called for an immediate vote.The Greens and Linke promptly backed the prospect.The CDU responded by condemning the SDP, its coalition partner, for its "breach of trust" after four years of joint rule.The angry exchange came just days after Schulz angered conservatives by accusing Mrs Merkel of an "attack on democracy", saying she was deliberately making politics boring so that opposition supporters wouldn't bother to vote
