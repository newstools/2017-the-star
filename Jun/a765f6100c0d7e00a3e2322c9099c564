ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi yesterday accused the government of forcing organisations to contribute money for campaigns.&ldquo;Heads of parastatals wamepewa target ili watoe pesa ya campaign...sasa hawa parastatal bosses wanauliza tutatoa wapi hiyo pesa ili watumie kwa campaign (Heads of parastatals have been given campaign money targets... These heads are wondering where they will get the money from),&rdquo; Mudavadi said.The campaigns kicked off officially on May 28. Mudavadi said the Jubilee administration should not put pressure on managing directors and chief executives. &ldquo;...if you are the MD or CEO, be very careful. Don&rsquo;t sign anything that might haunt you later,&rdquo; Mudavadi said in Bomet.He said NASA is keenly watching the government&rsquo;s moves. &ldquo;We want to warn them and tell them that NASA is watching. Do not use public resources for campaigns,&rdquo; he said.Mudavadi drummed up support for Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto&rsquo;s reelection bid.In April, the IEBC warned public servants against using state resources in their campaigns. The commission said such practices are against the provisions of Section 14 of the Election Offences Act, 2016.IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati said those who violate the law will be fined Sh2 million or jailed for six years.&lsquo;we want Maize, not flour&rsquo;Rutto said the government should consider taking maize to the counties, not flour. &ldquo;We want maize, not flour. We want a 2kg tin of maize to retail at Sh40,&rdquo; he said. The government unveiled a Sh6 billion maize subsidy programme last week to lower the unit cost of maize flour to Sh90, after it soared by a third to around Sh136 during a regional drought.
