Nyandarua woman representative Wanjiku Muhia is the architect of her own failure and should not blame other leaders, JP candidate Wairimu Gitau has said. On Sunday Gitau said Muhia lost because she stayed away after she was elected in 2013, while she [Gitau] &ldquo;stayed with the people&rdquo;. She spoke after a thanksgiving service at ACK Emmanuel in Manyatta. Gitau said the worst mistake Muhia made was underestimating her strong bond with Nyandarua residents. &ldquo;She belittled me. She went everywheresaying she has no competitor, andcalled me colourful names, oblivious of the strength I wielded,&rdquo; Gitau said &lsquo;VICTORY STOLEN&rsquo; Last month a court overturned Muhia&rsquo;s win and ordered the certificate be handed to Gitau. Gitau was given the certificate after the primaries but her win was later nullified by the tribunal. Gitau moved to the High Court to challenge the order, saying she had won fairly. She urged the court to reverse the tribunal&rsquo;s directive, saying she won fairly by 29,589 votes against the incumbent&rsquo;s 7,946. Muhia has sued Gitau and JP. She said suing JP is tantamount toundermining the President. Gitau said Muhia should have approached the President and Deputy President and request them for a job since she claims they are her friends. Muhia responded in an SMS, &ldquo;Faith has become faithless after the courts clearly established she STOLE my victory and indeed she was NOT the winner. As a result, she is hanging on everything everywhere. &ldquo;People of Nyandarua were and still are my darlings. Am more in touch than her. She knows my work like the return of matatu carriers, establishment of the cancer centre, affirmative action fund, the list is endless. Let her agree we go back to the ballot if she knows she won&rdquo;.
