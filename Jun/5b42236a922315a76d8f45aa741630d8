The family of a Kenyan bishop who was murdered in South Sudan last Friday is yet to come to terms with the brutal execution by a South Sudanese policeman.Hordes of sympathisers, relatives and friends have been streaming into the home of slain cleric Joel Kathoka in Kitui since the news of his brutal killing.He was cut several times in the head, arms and stomach, leading to his death.Speaking to the Star on Sunday at Kathoka&rsquo;s home in Ithui village, Kyuso, his uncle Kimanzi Kimotho said the family was informed that the assailant was a policeman who ambushed and attacked the cleric with a machete. &ldquo;What is more shocking is that the cold blooded killing was unprovoked,&rdquo; he said.Kimotho, the Kyuso chief, was with Kathoka&rsquo;s eldest son Meshach Mwikya, 24.Kimotho said the bishop was heading to his Jesus Live Ministry Church at 6am on Friday when he was waylaid and killed a few metres to the church in Juba.&ldquo;He was approaching the church gate when he was brutally attacked from behind ... He sadly bled to death,&rdquo; he said.He said Kenyans in South Sudan are raising funds to airlift the body to Kenya. The family said it expects the body today.Kimoto said Kenyans in South Sudan may pursue blood money compensation as allowed in the law, if the family agrees.
