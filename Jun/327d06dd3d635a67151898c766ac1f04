The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission now says Machakos governor aspirant Wavinya Ndeti is guilty of party hopping and should not be allowed to run for election.The commission, through lawyer Paul Nyamodi, on Friday told Justice George Odunga that Wavinya did not resign from the Chama Cha Uzalendo Party as required by the law before moving to Wiper.Nyamodi further told the court that as of the date of the purported resignation, which was April 6, Wavinya was still a member of CCU, and she only made a futile attempt to leave by use of a coalition of agreement.Nyamodi produced a letter which says Wavinya was a member of Wiper by virtue of an agreement.&ldquo;Wavinya only became a member of Wiper Party on the April 24, 2017, when her party CCU entered into a coalition agreement with Wiper party,&rdquo; Nyamodi said.The IEBC said the purported coalition agreement between CCU and Wiper does not meet the threshold of resignation from one party.The commission said Wavinya is not eligible to be nominated by any party to contest in any seat in the general election.&ldquo;The grounds made by Wavinya in this case including that of legitimate expectations have not been proven, and for those reasons the application for judicial review should be dismissed with costs,&rdquo; Nyamodi said.The commission also said Wavinya&rsquo;s name was not in the list submitted by Wiper to the IEBC on March 27.He said the law was clear that all parties should submit the list of those wishing to run on its ticket 90 days to election.However, in her submission, Wavinya, through lawyers Willis Otieno and Nzamba Kitonga, argued the IEBC had no jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter filed before the electoral commission committee.Wavinya further said the jurisdiction to determine the question of party membership is conferred on the Political Parties Dispute Tribunal and not the commission.She urged the judge to quash the IEBC committee&rsquo;s decision that barred her from contesting.The court was told the IEBC was the wrong forum for the petitioner to raise his complaint against Wavinya, and he should appeal against the decision at the High Court.She further said the MCA Peter Kyalo was not a candidate during the nominations and came in at the last minute as a busybody.Kyalo filed a petition before the IEBC disputes committee.He said Wavinya&rsquo;s nomination should have been rejected by the returning officer &ldquo;because it was irregular, unlawful and nullified by the disputes committee&rdquo;.On June 8, the IEBC tribunal nullified Wavinya&rsquo;s nomination on the Wiper ticket for being a member of two political parties.The former Kathiani MP was accused of violating the law by becoming a member of Wiper on April 6, a day after the defection deadline set by the commission.The IEBC, in a circular, set April 5 as the last day for aspirants to switch parties if they wanted to participate in the August 8 election.
