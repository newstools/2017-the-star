Nyanza Secondary schools boys&rsquo; soccer champions Kanga High School are in a bullish mood ahead of the national championships which kick off in Nyeri next week.Kanga coach Dick Obure warned that they shouldn&rsquo;t be taken for granted just because they have been paired with former national champions Upper Hill and St Anthony&rsquo;s Kitale alongside Ramisi in Pool &lsquo;A&rsquo;.&ldquo;We are seen as underdogs in the group but the boys are ready and raring to go. Those big names don&rsquo;t scare us. It has been a long journey for us to the nationals,&rdquo; he said. The coach added: &ldquo;We are in the nationals by merit not by fluke. We beat giants from this region to win the regional title. Upper Hill and St Anthony&rsquo;s may have the history but I don&rsquo;t think that will count. We want to write our own story at the nationals.&rdquo;Obure said the team is targeting a top three finish in the nationals to qualify for East Africa Secondary School games to be held in Gulu, Uganda in August.&ldquo;We are aware the regional champions Barding are out. Our aim is to go to Uganda and bring the trophy back to Nyanza,&rdquo; Obure said.Kanga narrowly defeated Kisumu County champions St. Ignatius Royola, Magadi 1-0 in extra time to win the Nyanza region title at Homa Bay School and will be making their debut at the nationals after narrowly missing out in the last four editions.Pool &lsquo;B&rsquo; has Kathungi, 12-time national champions Kakamega High School, last year&rsquo;s winners Passenga and a team from North Eastern region.
