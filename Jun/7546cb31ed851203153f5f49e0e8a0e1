Nyanza Secondary schools boys’ soccer champions Kanga High School are in a bullish mood ahead of the national championships which kick off in Nyeri next week. Kanga coach Dick Obure warned that they shouldn’t be taken for granted just because they have been paired with former national champions Upper Hill and St Anthony’s Kitale alongside Ramisi in Pool ‘A’. “We are seen as underdogs in the group but the boys are ready and raring to go. Those big names don’t scare us. It has been a long journey for us to the nationals,” he said. The coach added: “We are in the nationals by merit not by fluke. We beat giants from this region to win the regional title. Upper Hill and St Anthony’s may have the history but I don’t think that will count. We want to write our own story at the nationals.” Obure said the team is targeting a top three finish in the nationals to qualify for East Africa Secondary School games to be held in Gulu, Uganda in August. “We are aware the regional champions Barding are out. Our aim is to go to Uganda and bring the trophy back to Nyanza,” Obure said. Kanga narrowly defeated Kisumu County champions St. Ignatius Royola, Magadi 1-0 in extra time to win the Nyanza region title at Homa Bay School and will be making their debut at the nationals after narrowly missing out in the last four editions. Pool ‘B’ has Kathungi, 12-time national champions Kakamega High School, last year’s winners Passenga and a team from North Eastern region.
