Two MPs from Kisii on Thursday accused the opposition of dismissing everything the Jubilee administration has done. Joel Onyancha of Bomachoge Borabu)and Richard Tong’i of Nyaribari Chache said it is unfair for NASA presidential flagbearer Raila Odinga to deceive Kenyans that President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto have done nothing beneficial since they assumed power in 2013. Onyancha and Tong’i faulted Raila for criticising the SGR project. Onyancha said the SGR is a great achievement, because it will not only ease human transport, but cargo too. The two spoke in Kenyenya and Keumbu, respectively, when they presented their nomination papers to the IEBC. They will be defending their seats on the Jubilee Party ticket.
