THE opposition NASA has raised queries concerning the process of identifying the ballot paper printing company and the first thing the IEBC should do is to come clean and clarify the issues that have been raised.The IEBC should explain to the public what really happened. One of the things that need to be clarified within the short time that remains to Election Day is the need for transparency and a credible process that all stakeholders can trust.The best way to create a stable environment towards the August election is where the IEBC is forthright on what is expected of them. Since these issues have been raised, the issue of procurement is very sensitive and we do not want any perception from one contending side or the other, it is the IEBC that should clarify on this issue of procurement of the company to print the ballot papers. If there are any issues, then the Commission should call a bipartisan roundtable to brainstorm on the viability of the process, to check the extent of the damage.Visiting State House does not automatically mean that that person is hell-bent on the matter. The issue should be can all the stakeholders sit down and access what the company officials were doing at State House and then be able to make decisions based on that. Another issue that we need to note as Kenyans is that the timelines are no longer on our side and to start another procurement process - and we all know the process may take more time than the time remaining to the General Election. So, my thinking is that the IEBC must be seen as a serious arbitrator on the matter and since they are the ones who procured, they must explain how they went about it and they must also explain and make everybody understand that whatever the implications, the issue of the company having links to State House should not worry anyone. This means that everybody must be informed and brought on board.I was very happy that NASA candidate Raila Odinga on Tuesday said he will not go to court anymore to interfere with the process.So it is prudent for the IEBC to bring all these people to the table and explain to them what really transpired.Musau is national coordinator, Election Observation Group
