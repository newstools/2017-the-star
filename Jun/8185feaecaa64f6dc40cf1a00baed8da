The Jubilee party is tabling an amendment in Parliament that will allow government to promote itself up to the day of the election.Presently the Elections Offences Act 2016 states "No government shall publish any advertisements of achievements of the respective government either in the print media, electronic media, or by way of banners or hoarding in public places during the election period."Majority leader Aden Duale has tabled a motion to have the clause deleted.This is blatantly wrong. That clause is in the Act to prevent incumbent governments from using state funds to advertise themselves during the final election period.The taxes of all Kenyans - Nasa and Jubilee alike - will be paying for advertising saying what a great job the Jubilee government has done, even on August 8 itself.Is the government panicking? Why is it proposing something so cynical and unethical?No MP should support this motion that will fundamentally undermine democracy in Kenya.Quote of the day: "We cast a shadow on something wherever we stand." - English novelist E. M. Forster died on June 7, 1970
