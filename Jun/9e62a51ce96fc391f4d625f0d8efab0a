Two armed robbers made away with Sh1 million in one hour from several M-Pesa shops in Limuru town, Kiambu, on Wednesday evening.Armed with a pistol and a G3 rifle, the men went to different shops ordering operators and customers to lie down and hand over their money."We thought they were customers. They arrived and when we asked them to state the service they wanted, they ordered the three customers who were waiting to be served to get in, lie down and remain silent or get shot," shop operator James Gaitho said."They took more than Sh250,000 from my shop and (also robbed) customers who had come to make deposits. I'm not sure how much they were robbed but one had come to deposit Sh25,000. It was around 7.20pm."Samuel Wainaina was caught in the robbery leaving his shop to get change from Gaitho."I saw people outside while on the floor. I started praying for the customer's patience. I thought she would come to check where I went," Wainaina said.Gathio said a total of five outlets were robbed, adding: "This is not the first time."Ann Wangui said the robbers stole more than Sh300,000 from her customers and ordered to go into the washrooms and stay there until they left.Area AP commander James Mwaura said they intensified day and night patrols in business and market places to prevent more robberies.He asked residents to share information on the incident for action to be taken quickly.
