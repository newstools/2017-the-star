Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu on Thursday set free 36 inmates at the Lang&rsquo;ata Women Prison in keeping with the country&rsquo;s tradition of pardoning deserving inmates on public holidays. The inmates qualified for release after their sentences were reviewed by the Judiciary on the basis of time spent in pre-trial detention, total time served upon conviction and good behaviour. Among them are two Burundi nationals and a Tanzanian jailed for being in the country illegally. "Once you leave this place go and look for something worthy to do with yourselves.
