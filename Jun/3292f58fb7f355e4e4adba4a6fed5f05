Elgeyo Marakwet Governor Alex Tolgos has claimed Senator Kipchumba Murkomen is secretly financing independent candidates to rival JP. He accused Murkomen of backstabbing his own party, while still claiming to campaign for President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto.Tolgos wants Murkomen to declare his stand so that the President and the party will know if he is a genuine JP member or a pretender.&ldquo;I have evidence and details of meetings he has been holding with agents or secretariats of some of the independents,&rdquo; Tolgos said on Monday. He is facing a tough battle from independent candidate Moses Changwony.A week ago, Tolgos was heckled twice by angry crowds, when he tried to deliver campaign speeches.But Murkomen has dismissed the claims, saying he cannot finance independents, since two of them are vying for the Senate seat against him.&ldquo;As a founding member of Jubilee, it&rsquo;s inconceivable that I would be funding independents. I urge the governor to join me in uniting the people of Elgeyo Marakwet,&rdquo; Murkomen said.He denied meeting any independents or their agents. &ldquo;Fabricating lies like he did during the nominations will only serve to divide our county further,&rdquo; Murkomen said in a text message on Monday.
