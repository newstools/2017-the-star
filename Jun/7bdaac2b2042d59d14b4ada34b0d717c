Siria MP John Waluke has laughed off NASA's popularity in Bungoma warning the Opposition that Jubilee will sweep most of the seats.The MP, who shifted alliance from ODM to Jubilee, criticised NASA for "empty bragging" and said Jubilee will upstage them, not only in the county but also across Western."We have done our homework and challenge the Opposition...we are going to this election knowing the stakes it has," said the lawmaker. "Bungoma is gone and it is gone to Jubilee."Waluke ,who addressed the press at Parliament Buildings on Tuesday, taunted NASA's alleged popularity in principal Moses Wetangula's home turf."NASA stronghold is a fallacy, it doesn't exist because Jubilee will capture 60 per cent of the votes in our view," he declared.Wetang'ula, who is Ford Kenya leader, will vie for re-election as Bungoma Senator.During campaigns in Western at the weekend, President Uhuru Kenyatta said the Senator decided to defend his seat as he knows where the National Super Alliance is going.More on this: NASA can never beat Jubilee, Uhuru tells Western, laughs off strategiesWaluke warned NASA that "the tide has changed" in Bungoma, 56 days to the August 8 polls and added that Uhuru is "our people's darling"."I know they are in panic mode because of the huge crowds they saw in Bungoma on Sunday. That is just a snippet of the big things in store for Jubilee," he said.In one of the most well attended rallies in Western, a NASA bedrock, Jubilee stormed Bungoma town promising to turn tables against the Opposition.The MP dismissed as Opposition propaganda claims that supporters who attended the rally in Bungoma were taken there in school buses."People trekked, others rode bicycles and some drove themselves or came by matatu to witness the revolution that was underway in Bungoma. Nobody bribed anyone to attend the rally."Some Opposition MPs have blasted the ruling alliance for allegedly bribing people to attend rallies in NASA strongholds.
