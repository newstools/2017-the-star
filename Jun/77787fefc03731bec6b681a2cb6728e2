Jubilee is committed to security for all Kenyans and has given enough resources for this, President Uhuru Kenyatta said in Elgeyo Marakwet during campaigns on Saturday.Noting the aim is to foster growth, he said officers and Kenya Police Reservists deployed to different parts have curbed insecurity."Security is the most important thing. When you have peace, you can invest in infrastructure," he told Chesongoch residents and urged them to avoid conflict as insecurity undermines unity and growth.On Friday, Uhuru warned leaders and criminals perpetrating violence in the North Rift and Laikipia that the government will firmly deal with them.He noted the region has in the recent past seen an escalation of violence with communities displaced, property destroyed and death."I want to be perfectly clear that these perpetrators of violence and lawlessness in the North Rift, Laikipia and elsewhere will be dealt with."More on this: You've no room to divide Kenyans, Uhuru tells bandits wreaking havoc in North RiftThe President urged locals to turn up in large numbers to re-elect him and Deputy President William Ruto.Uhuru said the impact of developments initiated by Jubilee is being felt all over the county.He said his administration invested Sh8 billion in construction and maintenance of roads in the county, including the 34km Iten-Kapsowar and Iten-Bugar roads, and Chesoi-Chesongoch road.The President noted 24,000 homes now have electricity and that this is double the number of those who were connected four years agoUhuru further said he and Deputy President William Ruto have worked for four years to develop all parts of the country and that the results were there for everyone to see."But our opponents spent the better part of that time trying to agree on how to divide jobs amongst them.
