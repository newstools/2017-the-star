Jubilee's Polycarp Igathe has promised to address problems facing those in the creative industry if he and Mike Sonko win the Nairobi governor seat in the August 8 polls.He said musicians, actors, novelists and producers have for years been neglected, despite their contributions to the economy."Nobody cares about you, yet you are the job creating machines. You even don&rsquo;t have a place to perform. Our social halls are never usable,&rdquo; Igathe said on Thursday.He was speaking at the Kenyan Association of Music Performers, and Performers Rights Society of Kenya offices.Igathe accused the current county administration of turning a blind eye to the plight of youths, adding that most of the playgrounds have been grabbed, while social halls and theatres are dilapidated due to neglect."Look at City Stadium, the home of Gor Mahia. It was declared unfit to hold any match four years ago. Surely, what does it take to bring it to good shape?" he said.Read: Don't worry, I am Mr Fix it, Sonko's running mate Igathe tells NairobiansHe took a swipe at Governor Evans Kidero's administration saying the county has become bankrupt during its tenure."We are going to focus on effective service delivery, create jobs and wealth, eradicate traffic and enhance security," he said.
