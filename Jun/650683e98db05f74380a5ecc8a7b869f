Donald Trump's presidency has had a "major impact on how the world sees the United States", a new study says.The survey, by the Pew Research Center, interviewed more than 40,000 people in 37 countries this year.It concluded that the US president and his policies "are broadly unpopular around the globe".The survey shows only two of the 37 countries have a better opinion of Trump than they had of his predecessor Barack Obama: Israel and Russia.But the report indicates many feel their country's relationship with the US will not change over the coming years.The key findings from the survey carried out between 16 February and 8 May, include:PEOPLE HAVE LESS FAITH IN TRUMP THAN OBAMAPeople were surveyed at the end of Barack Obama's eight-year presidency, and after the start of Trump's term - they were asked if they had faith that the president would do the right thing for world affairs.Trump wasted little time in making his mark on world affairs - making clear he expected Nato countries to pay their fair share and encouraging Gulf countries to isolate Qatar in recent weeks.His presidency has shaken up old allies to the extent that German Chancellor Angela Merkel said, after she met Trump, that she felt Europe could no longer "completely depend" on its old ally.In fact, it is among the traditional US allies that the confidence has dropped the most, according to the survey - while 86 per cent of Germans had faith in Obama, for example, only 11 per cent do so in Trump.In his five months in office, the US president has, however, reached out to important friends - visiting Israel, Saudi Arabia and other countries early on.His focus on the relationship with Israel, for one, has paid off - though his preferred status among Israelis is also reflective of Mr Obama's unpopularity there.India, whose prime minister Narendra Modi met Trump on Monday, is one of the countries that looks on the US president most favourably - 40 per cent of respondents had confidence in him compared with 58 per cent for Obama."Across all the characteristics tested, positive and negative, President Trump is most likely to be described as arrogant," the Pew report says.In 26 of the 37 countries, more than half of respondents consider Trump dangerous.Having said that, the opinion changes depending on who is answering - those who say they are left-leaning are far more likely to consider him dangerous. In Peru and Brazil, it's those in the centre politically who are more likely to be worried.Across the board, Mr Trump is seen as a strong leader - Latin American and African countries in particular really believe this. The downside for him is that very few countries believe he is qualified to be president.TRAVEL BAN HAS HARMED US IMAGEThe findings were released only hours after the US Supreme Court partially lifted an injunction against President Trump's ban on visitors from six majority-Muslim countries.The ban, which had previously been blocked in lower courts, proved unpopular with 62 per cent of respondents across the 37 countries. A majority of people in only three of the countries - Israel, Hungary and Russia - supported the ban.In countries with large Muslim populations, the ban is unsurprisingly unpopular - with Jordan (disapproval rating of 96%), Lebanon (88%) and Senegal (82%) especially unhappy with the ban.NONE OF THIS MATTERSThat's not us saying it, it's the opinion of many of the 40,447 people interviewed by Pew and their associates.People may be worried about what Trump means for their country, many may see him as arrogant or dangerous - but that doesn't mean they think his presidency will have any effect on them.This is not true of everyone of course, but a median of 41% of people think their country's relationship with the US will stay the same.While only 15 per cent think ties will improve, some countries are extremely optimistic, especially in Africa - 54 per cent of Nigerians and 51 per cent Ghanaians think things will get better (as do 53 per cent of Russians, who are generally optimistic about the world with Trump in the White House, according to the survey).The country with the bleakest outlook for their ties with the US? Mexico, by some distance.
