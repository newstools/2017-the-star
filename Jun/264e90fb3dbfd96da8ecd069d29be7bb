Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has said the vandalism of county projects is politically motivated. He said water, lighting, road and security projects are the most targetted. "The hired goons have vandalised water projects in parts of Kangundo and we will not let them go scot-free," Mutua said. Last week, solar panels at the Kithumuoni water project in Kangundo were vandalised, disrupting water supply to at least 500 households. Mutua said unknown persons vandalised CCTVs in parts of Mwala subcounty. The governor, who was speaking at his office where he met members of the business community from Katangi ward, urged his opponents to campaign maturely. Mutua accused his main opponent Wavinya Ndeti of Wiper of engaging in a smear campaign against him. "I have information that she is on a mission to taint my image and the projects I have initiated. She will fail miserably, "said Mutua. He urged voters to give him a second term, adding that he is committed to offering transformative leadership.
