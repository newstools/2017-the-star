Muslims across the county have been urged to dedicate the holy month of Ramadhan to praying for elections.Garissa Governor Nathif Jama said prayers are paramount as the country prepares for the General Elections.He spoke at the launch of the Iftar Sa&rsquo;aem Initiative aimed at helping low-income families and the needy during Ramadhan.&ldquo;It is nobody&rsquo;s wish to see our country burn like it happened during the 2007-2008 post-election violence where lives were lost as a result of the clashes,&rdquo; Jama said.The governor said all Kenyans should be ambassadors of peace. He urged Kenyans to stop anybody trying to divide them along ethnic and religious lines. &ldquo;It is no secret that the stakes are so high in the election, with each side of the political divide exuding confidence of winning. However, we need to note that elections will be over within a short time but the country remains,&rdquo; Jama said.The Sa&rsquo;aem programme will run for 30 days and targets 28,000 poor families.It involves providing food hampers for the families to break the fast in the evening and also allocate money for the needy.The initiative stems from the Islamic value of &lsquo;giving&rsquo; and aims to enrich the beneficiaries&rsquo; lives financially and socially.Jama said, &ldquo;We have launched this programme to make a difference in communities across Garissa county. This year and during the month of giving, we will instil values of sharing, compassion and empathy.&rdquo;
