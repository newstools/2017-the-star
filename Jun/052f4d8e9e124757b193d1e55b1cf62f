So we decided to do as they wanted. But we are going to work as a team to ensure that we win as many seats as possible,&rdquo; ODM Nairobi chairman George Aladwa said.The technical committee of NASA spearheaded the negotiations.In 2013, the then Cord is said to have lost many seats to the Jubilee alliance because each of its affiliate parties had fielded candidates, which divided the votes.Jubilee won woman representative post, senator and 10 MP seats, and 42 MCA positions.
