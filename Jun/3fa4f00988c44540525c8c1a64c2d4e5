There is confusion in the Kisumu assembly as two people claim to be the bona fided clerk.This is after Philip Adundo resumed work after six months&rsquo; suspension.Adundo was suspended for allegedly mismanaging funds at the county assembly, which he claims was not proven.He said he went back to office on Monday, but Ben Opiyo, who was hired on an interim basis, has refused to vacate office. &ldquo;What he should know is that he was brought to the assembly to serve in an interim capacity. My suspension is over and I am ready to resume my duties, &ldquo;Adundo told the Star on the phone. He accused speaker Ann Adul of colluding with Opiyo to lock him out of office. This comes a few days before the MCAs are expected to adjourn. Opiyo said he is going nowhere and will continue discharging his duties as usual.
