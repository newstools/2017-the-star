An ODM politician has told off Water CS Eugene Wamalwa over his remarks that NASA candidate Raila Odinga should publicly declare that he will accept defeat.Wamalwa at the weekend, while accompanying President Uhuru Kenyata in Vihiga, told Raila to follow in the footsteps of Uhuru and declare that he will accept if he loses.But speaking to ODM youths in Bungoma town yesterday, MCA Ben Ombima said Raila should only declare that he will accept the outcome if all credibility issues he has raised are addressed.Ombima said it is clear that Jubilee is plotting to rig the polls and that&rsquo;s why they are predicting chaos and keep talking about it. &ldquo;Why are they worried if they know they will win the election in a free and fair manner? Is Raila mad to refuse to accept free and fair elections?&ldquo;How can Raila say he will accept results when he has raised pertinent issues like printing of ballot papers that have been ignored.&rdquo;Ombima wants the Jubilee administration to come clean on the training of &ldquo;military officers&rdquo; to participate in the polls.
