The Senate Committee on Information and Technology has completed the first ever end of term report, which details accomplished tasks, pending bills and continuity of bills even after the expiry of a parliamentary term.The report was prepared and handed over to Senate Speaker Ekwee Ethuro after a two-day workshop led by committee chairman and Nyeri Senator Mutahi Kagwe in Malindi.Addressing a press conference at the hotel, Kagwe said the end of term reports safeguard against duplication of activities and save taxpayers&rsquo; money. The Nyeri senator said the reports will also act as a benchmark to the incoming committees that they will use to gauge their performance.He said the move would serve as a motivating factor to the committees since they will strive to surpass the activities of their predecessors. &ldquo;All outgoing parliamentary committees should make the work of incoming committees easier by handing over a report indicating their achievements and challenges encountered,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.The Information and Communication Parliamentary Committee chairman said his outgoing team held 70 sittings and visited 32 counties. The members met key stakeholders in the ICT sector and sought numerous statements and motions in fulfilling their oversight role. Among its major accomplishments was follow up with the regular communication authority to ensure reduction of voice charges.
