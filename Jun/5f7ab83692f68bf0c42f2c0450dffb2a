A private developer has blocked an access road at the expansive Vipingo Ridge estate in Kilifi South, making it impossible for residents to access the highway leading to Mombasa. Thousands from Kapecha, Chodai, Dindiri, Maketa and Pingilikani have been forced to walk more than 10 kms to the highway. "It used to be easy for us. We would walk only three kilometres but now we walk more than 10 to get to the highway. We are suffering," one said. The developer erected a wall surrounding the estate which is home to prominent personalities who own luxurious maisonettes. "The investor has put up a gate at the start of what used to be the public access road. It is currently under 24-hour security surveillance," the resident said. Security guards manning the gate are only letting cars and motorcycles pass through. Kilifi North MP Gideon Mung’aro, who is Kilifi governor aspirant and Jubilee's Coast point man, toured the area on Thursday. Mung'aro said two security notices only say those using the route must observe traffic laws such as wearing high visibility vests and helmets and not playing loud music. “The road was closed to the public. One has to go around to reach Vipingo," he said. “The road must be opened to the public so residents can walk freely. I don’t see why the company erected a perimeter wall."
