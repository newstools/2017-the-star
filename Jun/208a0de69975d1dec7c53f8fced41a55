ODM Nairobi woman representative candidate Ether Passaris says the government is funding the Sonko Rescue Team to frustrate and undermine Governor Evans Kidero’s administration. “The government has failed to empower the governors, including our own governor here of Nairobi, who has had a shortage of funds neeed to do the a lot of work... and of course they are giving the other thing called the Sonko Rescue Team a lot of money on the side to do a few things here and there,” she said. The Sonko Rescue Team, which is run by Senator Mike Sonko, a candidate for governor on the Jubilee Party ticket, was registered as an NGO last month. The team duplicates the county government’s functions. It provides garbage collection services, sinks boreholes, supplies water to slum dwellers and offers rescue and emergency services to residents free of charge. The team has a fleet of vehicles, including a hearse, which ferries bodies upcountry and limousines and Mercedes Benz which offer free wedding services. Sonko was unavailable for comment.
