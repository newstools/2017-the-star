&ldquo;Why, you conniving little bitch!&rdquo; he said. My thoughts are back to the evening I blackmailed the VIP. I wasn&rsquo;t scared of him, despite his fury. I was holding all the cards. He looked cornered. Defeated. The feeling of power that washed over me was intoxicating. The seconds ticked away. Then minutes. Then he looked up. &ldquo;I have your guarantee that you will get rid of the baby?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I swear on its life,&rdquo; I said with a smile. He didn&rsquo;t respond to my attempt at humour. He grabbed a chequebook and wrote three cheques, ripped them out and handed them to me. &ldquo;Get out of here, you c**t,&rdquo; he hissed. I did not respond. Quit while you&rsquo;re ahead. I headed to the door.&ldquo;Samantha!&rdquo; he called out as I grabbed the handle.I paused at the door and turned towards him. &ldquo;About the other thing&hellip; What you saw when we were in Mombasa&hellip; What I told you&hellip;&rdquo; His voice trailed off.I slowly walked back to him. &ldquo;I want you to know on everything that is holy, that I will never betray your confidence about that,&rdquo; I said. And I meant it.That was then. Did he believe me? Who knows? If he put me in here, clearly not. The door opens and Bill walks in. &ldquo;Please tell me what&rsquo;s going on,&rdquo; I say, a little relieved to see him and not the other creepy man. &ldquo;My colleague has been taken away,&rdquo; Bill tells me. &ldquo;It seems you accused him of hurting you.&rdquo; I shrug. &ldquo;He would have eventually,&rdquo; I say. Bill narrows his eyes and a slight twitch betrays irritation. &ldquo;Getting hurt is precisely why you are here, Samantha,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Some just pay for the privilege of a clean canvas to work with.&rdquo;An unpleasant emotion comes over me at his words. He continues. &ldquo;You know what you owe. Once we have recovered it from our clients, you will be released.&rdquo; &ldquo;What I owe? To who?&rdquo; I ask.I knew it! This is the work of one of the men I blackmailed! But to what end? If they release me I could do it again! &ldquo;I have money in my account. Just take it!&rdquo; I say. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s too late for that,&rdquo; Bill says. &ldquo;You need to learn a lesson, I&rsquo;m told.&rdquo; The anxiety that has filled me is making me nauseous. &ldquo;These clients&hellip;. Wh- what will they do to me?&rdquo; I ask. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll hurt you,&rdquo; Bill responds matter of factly. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll hurt you very badly.&rdquo; I collapse on the mattress, my knees giving in. &ldquo;There are a few things you need to know,&rdquo; Bill continues. &ldquo;These men believe you are here willingly and you cannot tell them otherwise.&rdquo; My head is ringing, I can barely hear him. &ldquo;If you tell them you have been kidnapped, you will never leave here, do you understand me?&rdquo; he asks softly. Where is that ringing noise coming from? &ldquo;Do you???&rdquo; he asks again more forcefully.I nod, paralysed with fear. &ldquo;Good. The first client will be here tonight,&rdquo; he continues. &ldquo;He is the one that likes a clean canvas. We sent him your pictures and he is satisfied despite the small scar you blamed on my colleague.&rdquo;He passes me a box. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what he wants you to wear. We will give you whatever you need to get comfortable. Alcohol. Drugs. Whatever.&rdquo;He says it casually but there is an underlying urgency in his words.
