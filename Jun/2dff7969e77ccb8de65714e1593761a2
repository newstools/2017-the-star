Deputy President William Ruto yesterday dismissed plans by the opposition to legalise illicit brews if it wins the August General Election.Speaking during a church service at PCEA Ol Kalou in Nyandarua county, Ruto said such a move would undermine the war on alcoholism and drug abuse. Leaders who accompanied him include Youth CS Sicily Kariuki, Governor Daniel Waithaka (Nyandarua), MPs David Kiaraho (Ol Kalau), Kimani Ichung&rsquo;wa (Kikuyu), aspirants Francis Kimemia (governor) and Waweru Nderitu (MP Ndaragua).Ruto said drug abuse and alcoholism have ruined the lives of many youths and the situation would get worse if illicit brews are legalised.Nacada estimates that about 6,000 people die annually from alcoholism, while 2.5 million require rehabilitation. Ruto said leaders should be at the forefront in fighting alcoholism and drug abuse &ldquo;instead of promoting it&rdquo;.He urged religious institutions to support the government in its efforts to curb alcoholism and drug abuse among the youth. Ruto said, &ldquo;We already have a serious problem with alcoholism and drug abuse. It will be a step in, the wrong direction to legalise changaa and busaa.&rdquo;He continued, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s join forces in dealing with this menace. Pray for the opposition, which intends to legalise illicit brews, to have a change of heart over this matter.&rdquo;Ruto called for a peaceful election, urging religious leaders to continue praying for peace to prevail during and after the polls.&ldquo;Let the will of the people prevail,&rdquo; he said.The Alcoholic Drinks Control Bill, 2010 repealed the Chang&rsquo;aa Prohibition Act,which made it illegal to produce or consume traditional liquors including chang&rsquo;aa and busaa. But it now should be packaged.Ruto later issued cheques to IDPs at Anglican Church Primary School, Ol Kalou.He said the government is working towards helping IDPs engage in income generating activities. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unacceptable for someone to live on another&rsquo;s land while the owner is a squatter elsewhere,&rdquo; Ruto said. He told NASA leaders to avoid divisive politics.
