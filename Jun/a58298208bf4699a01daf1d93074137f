MAKE OWN DECISIONS Speaking to the press at their offices in Garissa town, secretary Abdullahi Salat said Muslims belong to different political parties. They should be left to decide on their own who they want to vote for, he said. “It is unfortunate that a few individuals would make statements that are not binding. We want to caution political parties not to be hoodwinked by individuals advancing their own interests and not speaking on behalf of the Muslim community,” Salat said. He added, “It is should be noted that nobody involved or consulted us before such a decision was arrived at. All we can do as Muslims is give guidelines to members then leave them to decide.” rise above endorsements Salat was with other Muslim clerics who said it was unfortunate that the same problem is always experienced every election year. He urged Kenyans to rise above endorsements and make informed decisions in the August elections.

Supkem secretary general Sheikh Adan Wachu said Muslim scholars and leaders have a duty to guide the community to make the right decision.
