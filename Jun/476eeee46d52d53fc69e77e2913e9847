Kenyan runners posted mixed results at the Ostrava Golden Spike World Challenge meeting with World and Olympic champion David Rudisha failing once again to sparkle in a weakened 1000m field.Rudisha finished fourth in 2:19.43 as the pre-meet playbook failed to materialise.Indeed the modest early going&mdash;just 55.49 at 400m and 1:52.54 at 800m&mdash;more than five seconds shy of what Rudisha indicated would suit him in his first appearance over the rarely-run 1000m, played nicely into the hands of Czech middle distance star Jakub Holusa who nearly pulled off an upset.Rudisha took the lead at the bell, but he didn&rsquo;t look comfortable at the helm. Clearly struggling entering the final straight, he was overtaken by compatriot Nicholas Kipkoech and Holusa, who powered by on the outside. The margin of victory was already in place at the top of the straight with the pair scrambling through to the finish. Kipkoech clocked 2:18.51, 0.09 ahead of the Czech while Rudisha faded to fourth.The men&rsquo;s 10,000m largely turned into an exhibition for two-time double Olympic champion Mo Farah, who came up just short of his assault on the world lead.&ldquo;I hoped we could run a little faster but the wind slowed me down even though we ran a fast pace from the start,&rdquo; said Farah, who clocked 27:12.09, some four seconds shy of the world lead. &ldquo;But I enjoyed it.&rdquo;The race was Farah&rsquo;s last over the distance on the track in a one-day meeting. Kenyan teenager Matthew Kimeli, competing in his third 10,000m race within 18 days, was second with a PB of 27:14.43. None of the other dozen finishers broke 28 minutes. Underscoring his 2017 form, Thomas Rohler dominated the javelin competition, throwing beyond 90 metres twice. He sealed the win with a 91.53m throw in the second round and followed up with 91.02m in the third.Another Kenyan, Benjamin Kigen, won the 3000m steeplechase in 8:11.54, a personal best, well clear of Ethiopian Getnet Wale and Hailemariyam Amare, who clocked 8:13.16 and 8:13.39 respectively.Olympic 400m champion Wayde van Niekerk broke the 300m world best to highlight the meeting. On an evening largely focused on a farewell celebration for Usain Bolt, it was Van Niekerk who stole the show and electrified the atmosphere after storming to a 30.81 performance over the rarely-run 300m distance, a powerful display that took down not only Michael Johnson&rsquo;s world best of 30.85 which had stood since 2000, but Bolt&rsquo;s 30.97 meeting record as well.The symbolism of the South African eclipsing one of Bolt&rsquo;s standards wasn&rsquo;t lost on many who see Van Niekerk as the heir to the Jamaican&rsquo;s throne as the sport&rsquo;s biggest star. But that&rsquo;s not a discussion Van Niekerk wants to have just yet.Van Niekerk&rsquo;s electricity made way for evening-capping emotion for both the capacity crowd of more than 15,000 that filled Ostrava&rsquo;s Mestsky Stadium and for Bolt, who was competing on its track for the ninth and final time.After a slightly sluggish first half, Bolt found some of his rhythm in the waning stages to win in 10.06, edging Cuban Yunier Perez who clocked a personal best of 10.09. The effort was hardly vintage Bolt, but it was a second 100m win in as many outings this season. Bolt&rsquo;s assessment was blunt.&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t a good race and I&rsquo;m not happy with the time,&rdquo; he said, citing ongoing health issues &ndash; his back primary among them &ndash; for his early season lack of fitness. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just getting into my running. I have some training to do to get some good execution.&rdquo;Even with the IAAF World Championships London 2017 just over five weeks away, Bolt said that while disappointed, he&rsquo;s not concerned.&ldquo;The time doesn&rsquo;t really represent where I&rsquo;m at. I&rsquo;ll be fine.&rdquo;
