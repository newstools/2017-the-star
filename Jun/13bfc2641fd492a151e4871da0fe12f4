Plans for Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho to lead Raila Odinga's campaign in Nyanza are ridiculous, his rival Hassan Omar (Wiper) has said.Joho, who is ODM deputy leader, is expected to lead candidates and the Nyanza presidential campaign team in their vote hunt.&ldquo;I cannot go to Migori or Kisumu to ask for votes for Raila. I want to go to ask for votes for Raila and Kalonzo in Nyeri and in Eldoret,&rdquo; he said on Wednesday night.He spoke during the Grand Annual Iftar he organised at Burahni ground.Nyeri and Eldoret are President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto&rsquo;s strongholds.The rallies Joho will lead are set for Ahero town, Nyando, Kenyatta sports grounds and the famous Kirembe grounds in Kisumu town.Kisumu county ODM chairman Kennedy Ajwang said they are aimed at making inroads in areas where independent candidates have gained ground and unite voters from Raila&rsquo;s backyard.Read: Governor Joho to lead Kisumu candidates in Raila campaignsOmar said he will seek votes Kadzandani and Shanzu.&ldquo;Every vote against Jubilee is very important now and they are found [in the two areas]. Let me go there...I do not have to campaign nationally. What I have and what the Wiper team has in Mombasa is common sense,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;We have left you to go national...you will find out when you come back that you have been ousted."The Wiper secretary general added he has not engaged much in national politics because he wants to ensure the grassroots in Mombasa votes for NASA.Wiper chief Kalonzo Musyoka is NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga's running mate.Read: Joho hijacks Iftar dinner, irritated Omar pulls out amid power tussleOmar said he informed the NASA principals of his planned Iftar but did not invite them because he is the one who is seeking votes for them, not vice versa.&ldquo;I am the one to ask Mzee Twhir to vote for Raila and Kalonzo. Raila cannot ask Mzee Twahir to vote for Hassan Sarai," he said.&ldquo;That is why I have called you here &ndash; to ask you to vote for Raila and Kalonzo. It is called common sense."He added it is important to ensure all 1.8 million votes at the Coast go to the National Super Alliance basket.Also read: 'I am the best': Omar tears into Mombasa governor rivals Joho, Shahbal and Awiti
