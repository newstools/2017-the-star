Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho's running mate, William Kingi, has started campaigns for his would-be boss reelection.The former Technical University of Mombasa don on Monday met opinion leaders from Likoni and Mvita constituencies to listen to their plight and seek their advice.This was the first time Kingi met Mombasa residents without the company of Joho, since he was unveiled as his running mate on May 25.The more than 100 opinion leaders, who converged at the governor&rsquo;s office, backed his bid in exchange of jobs for the thousands of unemployed youths in the two constituencies.The unemployment nightmare has been a thorn in the flesh of many Mombasa residents.It is this high rate of unemployment that has been blamed for the rise of criminal gangs.At 44 per cent, the unemployment rate in Mombasa is more than double the national average of 21 per cent.This has given rise to more than 40 criminal gangs in the county.The opinion leaders, comprising elders, women, the youth, and clerics, laid bare their frustrations over poor drainage, lack of clean water, high crime rate and too much politicking at the expense of development.Joho has been at loggerheads with the national government led by President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto over political and development projects.The opinion leaders said there is need for more professionalism in dealing with the national government.&ldquo;I believe your professionalism and education will be of great value to us as a county,&rdquo; Hussein Ruga from Shika Adabu ward said.Ramwendo Hamisi from Bofu ward said, &ldquo;There is a lot of flooding in Bofu during rains. A young child nearly drowned a few days ago.&rdquo; Kingi said the county government has been laying the foundation for development in the last four years.&ldquo;The next four years will be for putting up a building that will last for years,&rdquo; he told the leaders.Kingi was accompanied by county executives and Joho&rsquo;s advisers.He said he will not hesitate to consult authorities for matters that concern the national government.&ldquo;We will put in more effort in increasing the revolving funds to ensure more youths, women and people living with disability get funds for businesses,&rdquo; Kingi said.
