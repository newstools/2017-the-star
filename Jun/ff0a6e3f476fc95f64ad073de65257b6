The frosty relationship between the national government and the Nairobi government has gotten chillier over the stalled Westlands Market. The Sh195.6 million project is now in doubt after a second contractor was kicked out. Westlands Nairobi County Market chairman Samuel King&rsquo;ori yesterday said he recommended the contractor be removed as work was too slow. &ldquo;Pyramid Construction contract was terminated. We are waiting for the next contractor to finish the project,&rdquo; he told the Star on the phone. The market is to accommodate 500 traders. Construction started in 2008, but has stalled for nine years. On June 16 last year, Housing PS Aidah Munano told the contractor to finish work by September. On Thursday, the Star visited the site and found no work was going on. County Trade executive Anna Othoro said they have been asking the national governmen to eithe complete it or hand it over to the county.&ldquo;Initially, they said the contractor had been paid and should proceed. But the contractor says he has not received anything,&rdquo; she said in a text message.Othoro accused the national government of &ldquo;shifting goal posts&rdquo;, saying the delay is distressing the county government as well as traders.
