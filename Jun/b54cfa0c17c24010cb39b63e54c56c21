Jubilee should forget the Mt Elgon constituency seat, independent candidate Harry Kimutai has said.He said the assumption the Mt Elgon seat had already been bagged by Jubilee's Fred Kapondi is a big mistake and many will be shocked after the polls. Kimutai spoke to residents at the constituency on Saturday. Analysts, led by Isaac Wanjekeche, have predicted that Jubilee Party might easily win the Mt Elgon seat. Kimutai claimed the April Jubilee Party nominations were marred with irregularities. He defected from Jubilee after he was floored by Kapondi in the primaries.Kimutai, a renowned businessman, said he will unseat MP John Serut an independent candidate. ''We know the people of Mt Elgon have made up their minds and decided they want fresh leadership of someone who will bring meaningful change in the area,'' he said. Kimutai promised to prioritise education, improve roads and ensure security in the region is enhanced.
