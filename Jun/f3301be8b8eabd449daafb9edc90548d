Lenders are increasingly calling on the National Assembly to reconsider the proposed changes to the Banking (Amendment) Act to include fees and commissions in the cap on loan charges.The Banking (Amendment) Bill, 2017, sponsored by legislator Kimani Ichung&rsquo;wa (Kikuyu) in February, proposed amendments to the rate cap law to ensure the control is enforced on the annual percentage rate rather than the nominal interest rate.&ldquo;It is already a challenge to the banks to configure their business models in the new reality of the interest rate cap,&rdquo; Family Bank chief executive David Thuku said yesterday. &ldquo;If you want to have a free market then the best thing is not to legislate everything.&rdquo;The non-interest charges on loans largely comprise of legal, insurance and consultation fees. This is reflected in the Annual Percentage Rate, which captures the total cost of credit.Commercial lenders adopted the APR framework from July 2014 to help customers accurately compare interest rates in different banks to make informed decisions.Economists at pan-African lender Ecobank Transnational in a research note said lenders, who are still adjusting to interest controls, will struggle to cope with the proposed law.The research released in February suggested that on average, banks take home about 0.9 per cent of loan value in fees and commissions.&ldquo;Self regulation and market supply and demand in my opinion is the way to make the market sufficient as opposed to legislation which would be retrogressive on the gains the market has made,&rdquo; Thuku said. &ldquo;Capping everything is not necessarily the right thing to do.&rdquo;He lauded the initiative by the Central Bank of Kenya and Kenya Bankers Association to introduce a cost of credit portal that will help borrowers weigh against different lenders&rsquo; loan charges.&ldquo;The cost of credit portal is however a very good initiative because the cost of borrowing should be transparent, helping both competition and management of consumer choice,&rdquo; Thuku said.The study by Ecobank showed that non-interest charges are expected to rise above one per cent this year following the interest rate cap as lenders seek to compensate funded income shortages.Equity Group chief executive James Mwangi told an investors&rsquo; briefing last month that the country&rsquo;s lenders had witnessed a tough economic environment due to the impact of the interest rate controls which had seen most banks report profit declines since the law was effected in September.&ldquo;We strongly believe that interest rate capping is not sustainable for financial institutions. One way or another, it will have to be amended,&rdquo; Mwangi said.Speaking on the sidelines of Family Bank Business Club meeting, Thuku said that the government should instead address factors that affect demand and supply of varying customer needs.&ldquo;For greater growth, development and choice for customers the best thing to do is to try and address the fundamental things that make some prices get skewed in a particular way,&rdquo; Thuku said. The lender, through its Business Club, is sponsoring more than 97 of its SME customers for a 10-day business trip to the US where they will meet, share experiences with their business counterparts and participate in trade fairs.
