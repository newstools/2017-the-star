Domestic borrowing by the government is expected to remain high this month, analysts say, largely citing below target revenue mobilisation.Total revenue in 10 months through April 30 was Sh1.563 trillion, latest Statement of Actual Revenue and Net Exchequer Issues shows. This was Sh149 billion, or 8.70 per cent, off the Sh1.712 trillion target on pro rata basis.Two months to the end of financial year 2016-17 on April 30, the Treasury had a gap of Sh491 billion given its revised revenue target of Sh2.054 trillion.&ldquo;We believe under-performance in revenue mobilisation&hellip;..is likely to occasion more borrowing in the coming months,&rdquo; analysts at StratLink, a Nairobi-based financial advisory firm, said in a monthly economic update report last Friday. The sub-Saharan Africa-focused firm based its analysis on revenue data nine months through March, which stood at Sh984.6 billion against a target of Sh1.05 trillion, according to Quarterly Economic and Budgetary Review report to the National Assembly on May 16.&ldquo;A key drag on the performance has been PAYE (Pay AS You Earn) remittance which stood at 86.4 per cent in quarter three (October-December) 2016-17 compared to 89.2 per cent and 93.8 per cent in quarter two and quarter one, respectively,&rdquo; StratLink said.&ldquo;This decline comes against the backdrop of a wave of lay-offs across sectors.&rdquo;The banking sector has, perhaps, experienced highest redundancies as lenders moved to protect profit margins in the wake of interest controls through digitisation of processes to enhance operational efficiencies.The Treasury, in May, re-opened two bonds for sale with coupons of 9.3 per cent and 12.5 per cent, respectively,targeting to raise Sh40 billion.&ldquo;Just like the previous bond auctions held this year, the government did not accept expensive bids, accepting Sh20.0 billion out of the Sh38.8 billion worth of bids received, translating to an acceptance rate of 51.5 per cent,&rdquo; analysts at Cytonn Investments said in a monthly report yesterday.&ldquo;The market average rates for the bids came in at 12.6 per cent and 13.4 per cent while the average yields of the accepted bids were 12.5 per cent and 13.1 per cent for the two bonds, respectively.&rdquo;The Treasury, however, opened the same bonds in a tap sale and raised Sh15.9 billion, bringing the total sum to Sh35.9 billion &ndash; 89.8 per cent of the target.Last week about Sh28.62 billion, 19.25 per cent more than the Sh24 billion target, was raised from the weekly sale of Treasury bills on Wednesday at an average interest of between 8.54 per cent for 91-day paper and 10.91 per cent for one-year securities.
