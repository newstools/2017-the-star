Overall inflation, a measure of changes in average prices of goods and services, rose to a 58-month high of 11.70 per cent last month from from 11.48 per cent in April, state&rsquo;s statistician reported yesterday. Kenya National Bureau of Statistics attributed the rise in inflation, although slower than last month, to a rise in food inflation, which went up 21.52 per cent on average year-on-year in May. &ldquo;The food and non-alcoholic drinks index increased by 1.26 per cent compared to a rise of 3.55 per cent witnessed between March and April,&rdquo; KNBS director-general Zachary Mwangi (pictured)said in a statement. &ldquo;However the food index increased due to rise in prices of sugar, milk, maize grain and other food items which outweighed the decrease.&rdquo; There was, however, a significant decline in the prices of sukuma wiki (kales), cabbages, potatoes and spinach in May compared to June, largely due to ongoing rains, he added. The price of a kilo of maize grain jumped the highest at 54.30 per cent year-on-year to Sh64.35, closely followed by the cost of sugar which rose 49.4 per cent to an average price of Sh168.18. Mwangi also attributed the high inflation to a rise in the cost of kerosene, cooking gas and charcoal which resulted in a 0.06 per cent rise in the housing, water, electricity, and other fuels&rsquo; index. A litre of kerosene went up 38.2 per cent.
