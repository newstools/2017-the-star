A gunman who sprayed bullets at Republican lawmakers during baseball practice in a Washington DC suburb has died, US President Donald Trump said.House of Representatives Majority Whip Steve Scalise was one of five injured in the early morning ambush at a park in Alexandria, Virginia.The attacker, identified as Illinois native James T Hodgkinson, was killed after a firefight with police.The injured included two officers with non-life threatening wounds.President Trump described the attack as a "very, very brutal assault"."We may have our differences, but we do well in times like these to remember that everyone who serves in our nation's capital is here because, above all, they love our country," he added.Who is the suspectHe also called Mr Scalise - who was shot in the hip and is in a critical condition after surgery - a "patriot and a fighter".The lawmakers were practising for the annual congressional ballgame that organisers vowed would go ahead as planned on Thursday at Nationals Park, home of Major League Baseball team the Washington Nationals.Alexandria police said the FBI was taking over the investigation into the shooting, which began shortly after 07:00 (11:00 GMT) on Wednesday morning at Eugene Simpson Stadium Park.As well as Scalise, two police officers, Krystal Griner and David Bailey, lobbyist Matt Mika and Zack Barth, a congressional aide for Texas lawmaker Roger Williams, were injured.Barth, a former staffer for two Republican congressmen, was shot in the chest, according to witness Arizona Senator Jeff Flake.Flake told reporters he was at bat during the shooting and the victims were "sitting ducks".Senator Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, said someone at the baseball field had used a belt as a tourniquet on Scalise, who is the number three House Republican.South Carolina congressman Jeff Duncan said the suspect had asked him whether Republicans or Democrats were practising, before shots rang out.Kentucky Senator Rand Paul told Fox News: "I do believe without the Capitol Hill police it would have been a massacre."We had no defence at all. The field was basically a killing field."He said they were lucky that Mr Scalise was present because he has a security detail owing to his congressional seniority.Mo Brooks, an Alabama Republican, told CNN he was on third base during the baseball game when he saw Scalise, who was on second base, shot.He said Scalise had a bullet hole in his leg, but was saying: "I'm OK, I'm OK."Brooks said everyone on the field scattered as 50 to 100 shots were fired.He said a gunfight had ensued between the shooter and the congressmen's police security detail, who were armed with pistols.Brooks, who took refuge behind a batting cage, said the gunman was armed with a rifle and was "blasting away" from behind the dugout.He said congressmen Chuck Fleischmann, of Tennessee, Ron DeSantis, of Florida, and Jeff Duncan, of South Carolina, were among 15-25 other lawmakers at the game.Asked by a CNN host if the attack was deliberate, Mr Brooks replied: "Well, it sure as heck wasn't an accident!"He was going after elected officials, congressmen."Brooks continued: "The only weapon I had was a baseball bat and that's not the kind of fight you want to engage in."Ohio congressman Brad Wenstrup, who served in Iraq as a combat surgeon from 2005-06, provided medical care at the scene.He said the attack had lasted for at least 10 minutes, adding: "He had a lot of ammo."Alexandria Police Chief Michael Brown said his officers had responded and engaged the shooter within three minutes.The last member of Congress to be targeted by a gunman was Democrat Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot in the head as she met constituents in Tucson, Arizona, in January 2011. She survived, but six others died in that incident.Giffords&rlm; said in a statement: "This shooting is an attack on all who serve and on all who participate in our democracy."The top Republican in the House of Representatives, Speaker Paul Ryan, was applauded on the chamber floor as he said: "We are united... an attack on one of us is an attack on all of us."
