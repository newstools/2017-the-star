Manufacturers, importers and large consumers of plastic bags, such as the supermarkets, have until August to declare their stocks of plastic bags. The National Environment Management Authority said this is part of the implementation of the gazette notice on the ban of plastics that was issued in February. Nema director general Geoffrey Wahungu yesterday said they have developed a strategy covering publicity, compliance enforcement and scientific information mobilisation. This, he added, will be implemented from May-August as a short-term measure and medium-term from next month–June 2018, to ensure the success of plastic bags ban. “In the compliance enforcement strategy, Nema is serving notice to manufacturers, importers and large consumers to submit their compliance plan to the plastic ban and a declaration of stocks held by the time the ban takes effect with copies to KAM,” Wahungu said. He spoke during a forum on plastic ban at the UN headquarters, Nairobi. Wahungu said they will write to regulators including, KRA, Kebs and the county governments to submit information on importers of plastic bags
