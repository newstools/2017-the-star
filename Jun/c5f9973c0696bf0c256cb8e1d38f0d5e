Michelle Obama is adapting to life outside the White House, and she has brought one tradition with her: the workouts she shares with her close friends.The former First Lady shared a series of photos of a bootcamp on Monday, revealing she got into the habit of hosting the fitness sessions during her husband's presidency.Now that she and Barack have moved out of the White House, 53-year-old Michelle is perpetuating the tradition, and invited her closest friends for a sunny sweat session, including plenty of planking and core-strengthening moves."When I was at the White House, I often hosted bootcamp weekends for my close girlfriends. It didn&rsquo;t matter that we were all at varying fitness levels,' she wrote in the caption, reminiscing on past sessions."Our bootcamp weekends were a reminder that if we want to keep taking care of others, we need to take care of ourselves first."The session, which according to People took place at a friend's house outside of Washington, DC, occurred on a sunny day and under the watchful eye of an instructor.Michelle, who has been spotted attending classes at a Washington, D.C. Soul Cycle since moving out of the White House, is a well-known fitness fan.She has previously demonstrated her push-up skills on Ellen Degeneres' show, and as First Lady, highlighted the importance of exercise as part of a healthy lifestyle via her Let's Move campaign."Even though I&rsquo;m no longer at the White House, I've continued this tradition and wanted to share some photos," she said of her most recent workout pictures."My girlfriends have been there for me through all kinds of life transitions over the years&mdash;including a pretty big one recently!&mdash;and we&rsquo;ve done our best to stay healthy together."The former First Lady then encouraged her followers to find their own ways of staying active throughout the warmer months. "Whether it&rsquo;s a bootcamp or a walk around the neighborhood, I hope you and your crew can find some time this summer to be healthy together," she added.In her photos, Michelle can be seen in a white and peach tank top and a black hat, performing some impressive strengthening moves under the sunny sky.She held a challenging plank pose&mdash;thus working on her famously toned arms&mdash;and also completed some lunges among her friends.The trainer took the group through some more mat work, which included some abs exercises.Michelle's friends were by her side, each on her own exercise mat, going through the routine on the grass with towels at the ready.Over the weekend, the former First Lady also paid tribute to her 55-year-old husband for Father's Day. She shared a sweet throwback snap of the ex-commander-in-chief with their two daughters, Malia and Sasha, when they were children."Our daughters may be older and taller now, but they&rsquo;ll always be your little girls. We love you,' Michelle wrote in the caption.Barack responded with an equally loving message for Malia, 18, and Sasha, who turned 16 earlier this month."Of all that I've done in my life, I'm most proud to be Sasha and Malia's dad,' he tweeted. 'To all those lucky enough to be a dad, Happy Father's Day!"
