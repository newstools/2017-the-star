Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong (pictured) has received a political blow after his deputy Kizito Wang&rsquo;alwa announced he will not support his reelection.Wang&rsquo;alwa said his decision to withdraw as Ojaamong&rsquo;s running mate is as a result of the governor and his insiders sidelining him in running the county.Speaking in Busia town yesterday, Wang&rsquo;alwa said he is ready to resign and hand over to a person Ojaamong will pick.He withdrew a few hours after Lands executive Bernadette Muyomi resigned on Tuesday, citing interference from Ojaamong&rsquo;s insiders.The relationship between Ojaamong and his deputy has been unhealthy after Funyula MP Paul Otuoma, who is vying for the Busia governor&rsquo;s seat, garnered more votes from Butula subcounty, Wang&rsquo;alwa&rsquo;s home turf, during the April 13 nominations.
