Homa Bay speaker Samuel Ochillo yesterday denied claims that some MCAs are pushing for a trip to Mombasa.Last week, social media was awash with news that some MCAs wanted to travel to Mombasa for a 15-night holiday, whose cost is about Sh24million.Each of the 64 MCAs is expected to get a night out allowance of Sh14,000 , a transport allowance of Sh20,000, while their accommodation will be catered for separately by the assembly.However, an MCA, who decined to be named, said the assembly does not have enough money to fund the trip. &ldquo;My fellow MCAs consumed a lot of funds from the kitty. I believe if there is any amount remaining, it is too little. Unless the MCAs are sponsored by someone else,&rdquo; the MCA said. Bunge la Wananchi speaker Walter Opiyo criticised the attempt by the MCAs to squander county resources.
