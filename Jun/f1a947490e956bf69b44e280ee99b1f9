I read the story titled &lsquo;I&rsquo;m ODM governor, that&rsquo;s why state won&rsquo;t pay debt &mdash; Kidero&rsquo; in the June 8 edition of a local newspaper with great interest.I agree with Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero on the need for resolution of the historical accounting differences between the national government and the county.Nevertheless, the correct position is that the national government has over the years paid for loans that the now-defunct City Council of Nairobi took for infrastructure development from the early 1980s to the early 2000s.On the contrary, the national government has not consistently remitted funds for land rates and parking fees to the county. Consequently, both parties need to balance their books and bring the matter to a logical closure. It is, therefore, imperative that the following issues be brought to light:The county has secured close to Sh50 billion from the national government and should have collected over Sh80 billion over the past four years, considering the current administration increased fees and charges by over 100 per cent.In addition, the current administration has benefitted from my administration&rsquo;s automation programme that sought an annual increase of revenue by 25 per cent.Historical debt should have no bearing on service delivery. Thus, amounts once confirmed should be treated as &ldquo;windfall&rdquo;.Historical debt should have no bearing on the current administration&rsquo;s failure to pay statutory debts. This in itself is not only illegal, but also criminal.The current administration should categorically show what it has achieved with at least Sh100 billion collected and transferred from the national government.The current administration should emphatically explicate to Nairobians why the county has failed to implement the comprehensive HR review report compiled by PricewaterhouseCoopers and commissioned by my administration.The governor should illustrate to Nairobians whether he achieved his targetted revenue increase of 148 per cent promised during his 2013 campaigns.He should further demonstrate that he achieved his revenue target through avenues other than increasing fees and charges by 100 per cent as it will indicate his competence in diverse revenue sourcing.It is my humble submission that the current administration has failed to demonstrate accountability in the materialisation of its set goals and efficient utilisation of the billions collected.Nairobians should unite and take a stance in ensuring we elect a befitting administration with a vision for our great county.Philip Kisia, MBS FKIM FMSK The last CEO/Town Clerk of Nairobi.
