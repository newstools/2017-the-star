Mombasa governor hopeful Hezron Awiti has said he will build markets for hawkers in all six constituencies during his first year of leadership if elected.There are about 5,000 hawkers in the county. They have been evicted from the main streets of Mombasa.The latest eviction was of 300 hawkers from the Buxton stage on May 22. Governor Hassan Joho&rsquo;s rivals accused him of &ldquo;not having a heart for small traders&rdquo;.Awiti on Saturday led 800 hawkersi n a demonstration. The group walked 10km as part of an initiative Awiti called &lsquo;Hawkers&rsquo; Day&rsquo;.The group walked from Kongowea, through to Buxton, Markiti and Majengo markets, where Awiti declared support for the hawkers and other small-scale traders.Some hawkers said they have quit the business altogether and opted to work at construction sites because of frequent confrontations with Inspectorate officers. &ldquo;We feel betrayed by our county leaders,&rdquo; hawker Athman Rosta said.County officials said some traders illegally operate in restricted areas. They said the county intends to expand roads in areas where hawkers&rsquo; stalls have been demolished, including the Buxton stage. But some politicians opposed to the move said illegal hawking and operating in restricted areas should not be punished by destroying the traders&rsquo; means of livelihood.Governor hopefuls Awiti, Senator Hassan Omar and Jubilee candidate Suleiman Shahbal said there are better ways to handle the hawkers issue.Awiti, who is the Nyali MP, said the 10km walk was to demand justice for hawkers.The traders and hawkers were drawn from Buxton, Kongowea, Mackinon, Mwembe Tayari and Majengo markets.Awiti said hawkers are &ldquo;roaming the streets&rdquo; because the county failed to secure Mwembe Tayari market which was allegedly grabbed.&ldquo;Some of these people would have been housed there and sold their goods uninterrupted. They have also failed to expand other markets. Alternatively, there should have been a new market by now,&rdquo; he said.Hawkers and their battles with city askaris have been a thorny campaign agenda.The majority of hawkers are non-indigenous and known for voting as a bloc.&ldquo;Our ambition as Vibrant Democratic Party is to set a market in all the six Mombasa subcounties,&rdquo; Awiti said at Mackinon market during a stopover.He said there should be a law to reduce rates.
