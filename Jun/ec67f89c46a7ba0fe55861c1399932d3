Wiper party has distanced itself from Kitui West MP Francis Nyenze after openly supporting Jubilee Party leader Uhuru Kenyatta's reelection.During a rally on Sunday, Nyenze and Kitui Senator David Musila asked youths to support the President on the basis of his development record.Nyenze who is defending his seat on a Wiper Party ticket said those saying Uhuru had not performed were peddling lies.But in a statement on Monday, Wiper Executive Director Jared Siso condemned and disassociated the party from the utterances."...this is contrary to the stand of WDM-K that is of the view that the Jubilee presidential candidate and his regime have been massive failures in governance since 2013," he said.Siso said the party will seek a clarification from Nyenze if he has shifted his allegiance from Wiper to Jubilee."...after which we will chart the way forward. The reports indicate that Kitui West are locked under Wiper/NASA and under the able leadership of Kalonzo Musyoka, whose support from the region is near fanatical," he said."Therefore, for Jubilee to even imagine it can make a significant impact in vote hunting from the region is an exercise in futility."During the rally, Nyenze also praised Jubilee administration for a job well done in its efforts to empower special groups like the youth and women.&ldquo;If somebody does well to you, you can&rsquo;t forget. Can you forget those who have done well like Uhuru Kenyatta?&rdquo; he said at Kauwi primary school.Earlier, Musila claimed that comments that he supports President Uhuru Kenyatta's re-election were taken out of context."Vote for me as an independent candidate, elect Uhuru without minding his party," Musila said as he campaigned with Nyenze.But on Monday, Musila denied the claims further blaming the remarks on "unknown forces".More on this: I did not endorse Uhuru's re-election, Musila says
