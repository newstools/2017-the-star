Millionaire businessman Bundotich Kiprop will not back down for Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago despite the DP's request.Kiprop alias Buzeki announced this on Saturday, just hours after Deputy President William Ruto declared support for Mandago and asked him to quit the race.Buzeki said the Governor is Ruto's project in the county and that "he does not stand for anything"."I am an independent and that is final. He has cast his dice...I will cast mine too...No backing off. If Ruto supports what Mandago stands for then we now know him well," he said."Let the people of Uasin Gishu decide on August 8," he further told The Star and reiterated that he will be in the race to the end.The businessman further said the people of Uasin Gishu cannot be intimidated where their democratic rights are concerned.But he noted he will accept the results and asked Mandago to do the same."Democracy must prevail. If he wins I will accept the results and back him but the likely result is that he will lose. Let him get ready to accept that and support me," he said.Buzeki added that his vision to transform Uasin Gishu is unstoppable.Ruto earlier said Mandago won the primaries and deserves to be supported by all those who lost, including Buzeki.More on this: Ruto backs Mandago, asks Buzeki to drop bid for Uasin Gishu governorSome analysts say Ruto&rsquo;s endorsement of Mandago may not change the political scene in Uasin Gishu and that Buzeki will still give the Governor a run for his money.
