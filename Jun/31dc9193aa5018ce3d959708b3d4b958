About 100 Nyeri askaris went on strike on Tuesday demanding that their Sh3.6 million Madaraka Day celebrations payment be made.They noted they rehearsed daily from May 1 for the special assignment at the celebrations that took place at Kabiruini grounds on June 1.Njeri Mathenge said they were promised they would receive their money last week but that they were yet to.Mathenge said other officers had already been paid so they did not understand why they were left out.John Ichura, who works in the fire department, maintained they will not resume duty until they are paid."We will not accept the money if deductions are made," he said.Efforts to contact Nyeri Governor Samuel Wamathai were fruitless as he was out of office.Last week, about 600 women who entertained Kenyans at the same function spent the night in the cold demanding Sh3.5 million which was released by State House.The women from Nyeri's 25 sub counties accused Wamathai of neglecting them after their performance at Kabiruini grounds.More on this: Nyeri women camp in cold after dancing for Uhuru, demand pay
