Independent candidates
have asked their Jubilee counterparts to
stop accusing them of having a hidden agenda. Ngewa MCA
Karungo wa Thang’wa said some JP candidates are afraid of the
independents and are spreading propaganda that they secretly support the
opposition. Thang’wa lost the Jubilee Kiambu Senate primaries to the incumbent,
Kimani Wamatangi. He said he supports President Uhuru Kenyatta’s
reelection. Thang'wa was speaking at Acre Tano, Kikuyu constituency, on Monday. He was on a meet-the-people tour when he was stopped by boda boda riders who gave him
Sh3,230 for his campaigns. “I was so
overwhelmed when I told the riders and residents about my stand. I told them I was
lobbying for finances to print posters and support my campaigns but they quickly
contributed the money jokingly, and gave it to me,” Thang’wa said.
