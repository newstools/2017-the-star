Murang&rsquo;a woman representative Sabina Chege has said she will continue her campaign to have Jubilee Party nominees elected in August despite strong opposition from independent candidates.She yesterday said before the primaries, all aspirants vying on the JP ticket had pledged their support for the party and the President, but after losing &ldquo;they started badmouthing Jubilee&rdquo;.Chege has visited many media stations asking JP members to only vote for aspirants vying on the party&rsquo;s ticket.She has said it is hypocritical of independent candidates to criticise the party and at the same time declare their support for President Uhuru Kenyatta. Chege said the two cannot be separated.&ldquo;It is interesting to see some aspirants bad-mouthing our party by claiming the Deputy President rigged out some top leaders from Central region to install his own people, yet declare that they support Uhuru,&rdquo; she said.Chege continued, &ldquo;Who told them they are top politicians? It could be that they are still in denial and think they are influential people, while in actual sense they are not.&rdquo;
