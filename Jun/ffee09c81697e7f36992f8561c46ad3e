Uhuru said his government is keen on improving infrastructure.Uhuru and Ruto said the Jubilee government has prioritised the improvement of infrastructure in Meru county. &ldquo;We launched the construction of the road linking Laare to Isiolo and it will take you 30 minutes to reach the Isiolo International Airport as opposed to the four hours it takes now,&rdquo; Uhuru said.Jubilee also set aside funds to upgrade Maua town.Ruto said the planned transformation of Maua is part of Jubilee&rsquo;s agenda to industrialise the country to create more jobs.Uhuru said roads will be upgraded at the cost of Sh1.1 billion. &ldquo;The Jubilee government wants Maua to be a city like Nairobi,&rdquo; he said.Uhuru said Sh700 million has already been set aside to construct a modern sewerage system. The President also issued a directive for the upgrade and modernisation of the Maua Stadium by next year. The opposition toured Igembe and Tigania, which are miraa-growing areas.Last week, NASA presidential flagbearer Raila Odinga told farmers in Maua the government has not done enough for them during the four years it has been in power. He said miraa farmers continue to suffer at the hands of Jubilee.But Uhuru said his government has done a good job. He said the government started by legalising miraa as a cash crop and has registered farmers so they can benefit from the Sh2 billion they gave out to cushion farmers from effects of the UK and other European countries&rsquo; ban. He said formation of Sacco&rsquo;s will enable farmers to access loans.
