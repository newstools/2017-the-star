Most services at the Moi Referral Hospital in Voi have grounded to a halt following the ongoing nurses' strike.All the hospital wards remained closed on Wednesday after patients were released to seek services from private facilities, because there were no nurses to attend to them.Hospital medical superintendent Charles Guandaru told the Star the maternity wing is also closed and only the neonatal unit is operating.&ldquo;The neonatal unit is operational with eight nurses, who are on contract. The maternity unit and wards are all closed. We had to give a waiver to the patients at the wards to leave the facility,&rdquo; he said.Services at the outpatient, the casualty wing, the clinic for TB treatment, the Comprehensive Care Unit and the doctors clinic all remained operational.Guandaru said the number of patients visiting the hospital has reduced drastically since the strike started on Monday.&ldquo;People are aware of the strike and most of them have opted to take their patients to private hospital,&rdquo; he said.A spot check by the Star revealed that most patients were flocking in private facilities.Some of the patients have opted to seek the services from Tanzania.&ldquo;Those with the financial muscle are opting to take their patients to Tanzania, especially those from Taveta. We urge the government to end this stalemate, because people are suffering. It&rsquo;s sad as the government is yet to even honour the agreement they entered with doctors,&rdquo; Guandaru said.Taita Taveta KNUN branch secretary Boniface Mrashui told the Star on the phone that all nurses in the county have downed tools.&ldquo;Our nurses will stay away from hospitals until the CBA is signed by the government,&rdquo; he said.
