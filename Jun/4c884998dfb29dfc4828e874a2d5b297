Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi on Wednesday claimed Jubilee Party is using ethnic divisions to gain ground in the Coast region.&ldquo;JP politicians are now trying to use divisive politics to poison our minds. They know the party cannot be embraced in the region and that is why they want to come and preach the issue of tribal affiliations in order to retain power,&rdquo; he said.Speaking in Shimo la Tewa ward after meeting local leaders from various communities living in the region, Kingi urged the people to embrace cohesion for peaceful co-existence.He was with Senator Stewart Madzayo and Shimo la Tewa ward ODM candidate Sammy Ndago.Madzayo asked residents to vote for leaders who will not discriminate against citizens if they form government. &ldquo;I will always advocate for a Raila presidency,&rdquo; he said.
