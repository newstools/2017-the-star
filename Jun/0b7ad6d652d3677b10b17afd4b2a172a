Governor candidates Kenneth Lusaka and Wycliffe Wangamati have been slapped with a Sh1 million fine each after chaotic rallies that claimed the life of one person in Bungoma.A woman was shot dead as police attempted to disperse supporters of the two candidates who had clashed on June 2.Lusaka and Wangamati were holding parallel rallies after they were cleared by the electoral agency when the incident happened.IEBC's Electoral Code of Conduct Enforcement Committee said that Lusaka and Wangamati breached the code by failing to prevent supporters from clashing."We find that there was outright breach of electoral conduct by both. Lusaka and Wangamati are to pay a Sh1 million fine each to IEBC within the next 24 hours," committee vice chair Consolata Nkatha said on Wednesday.She said failure to pay the fine within the duration set would lead to disqualification from the August 8 general elections.During proceedings, Lusaka and Wangamati traded accusations over the incident. Wangamati claimed Lusaka's supporters were armed with crude weapons and attacked his convoy after addressing a crowd at Bungoma Bus Park."The reason we are here is because Lusaka followed us. We have video clips to present to you showing youths wearing red Jubilee t-shirts armed with rungus attacking my convoy from behind," Wangamati said."When my supporters heard that they were being attacked, obviously there were clashes," the Ford Kenya candidate added.But Lusaka, the incumbent governor, said it was his rival's supporters who "unleashed a swarm of bees".The Jubilee candidate committed to paying the fine.Read: Lusaka's bodyguards beat up journalist for airing 'bad' storiesThe committee also fined indepedent Rarieda MP candidate Netto Adhola Sh250,000 for using ODM's colours and party leader Raila Odinga's portrait in his campaign posters.ODM candidate Erick Onyango has filed a complaint to IEBC that Adhola was deliberately using the colours and image to masquerade as the party's nominee to "hoodwink illiterate voters" ahead of the polls.Starehe ODM candidate Steve Mbogo got a reprieve after the committee quashed the complaint by his rival Thomas Makori for destroying his posters.Makori wanted Mbogo to write a formal apology and compensate him for the damage.But the complaint was dismissed for lacking &ldquo;merit.&rdquo;Commitee chair Wafula Chebukati observed that Makori&rsquo;s posters were placed on top of Mbogo&rsquo;s from photographic evidence submitted during the hearing.Chebukati said Makori&rsquo;s action to block Mbogo&rsquo;s posters, despite launching the complaint, was unlawful.The committee also dismissed a complaint by Mountain View MCA candidates in Westlands, where an independent aspirant Peris Ayuma was accused by NASA rival rival Raphael Musyoki of using the ANC logo to hoodwink voters as the party's nominee.But Ayuma was ordered to remove any poster with the ANC logo.
