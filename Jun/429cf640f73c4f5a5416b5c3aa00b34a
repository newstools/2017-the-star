Some 200 Kenyan women living with obstetric fistula will benefit from free fistula surgeries in a series of medical camps across the country.This comes after the Kenyatta National Hospital, the Safaricom Foundation, the Freedom from Fistula Foundation and Flying Doctors Society of Africa launched a Sh12 million campaign yesterday.Fistula is an abnormal opening between a woman's vagina and the bladder. It is estimated that more than two million women live with fistula worldwide with new cases in Kenya estimated to be about 3,000 each year. Further, it is estimated the occurrence stands at three to four women for every 1,000 deliveries.The condition mostly affects poor rural women and girls across Africa and has been termed by the World Health Organisation &ldquo;the single most dramatic aftermath of neglected childbirth".The free medical camps will focus on two key strategies; prevention by offering training to health workers and free surgical repairs to women with fistula. Physiotherapy to women with urinary incontinence will also be offered.KNH acting CEO Dr Thomas Mutie said despite the high prevalence rates of fistula in the country, many women are suffering in silence as they are not aware the condition has a cure rate of more than 90 per cent.He indicated women who experience obstetric fistula suffer constant incontinence, shame, social segregation and health problems.&ldquo;However, with the new government policy on implementation of the free ante-natal and maternity services, the numbers are expected to to drop because of accessibility to maternal services,&rdquo; he said.This years camp under the theme &ldquo;Capacity building for VVF care in Kenya&rdquo; seeks to enhance the capacity of health systems to prevent, repair and support women with obsteric fistula and also improve access to and utilization of safe motherhood services.Since 2006, approximately 4000 women suffering from vesicovaginal fistula -cited as the most common type of fistula in the country-have undergone successful surgeries.Nominated Senator Beatrice Elachi who officially launched the camp, expressed hope that fistula the awareness campaign would enlighten members of society on the disease whose treatment is available at no cost.She commended KNH for organizing the camp in collaboration with Safaricom and the Freedom from Fistula Foundation, saying the initiative will go a long way in assisting women affected by the condition.She also urged people to abstain from sex and to avoid inserting objects in their private parts as it is also a cause of fistula.&ldquo;You might think sex is very enjoyable but it is also poisonous if abused. In your young age try to be more careful with your relationships. Don't allow your partner to use a different object or place when having sex. Carry yourself with dignity,&rdquo; she said.According to Dr. Mutie, There are an estimated 3000 new cases of fistula each year in Kenya, with only 7.5 per cent able to access medical care for he condition.He observed that from every woman who dies from pregnancy related complications, 20 women survive but experience terrible injuries and disabilities.&ldquo;The number of new obstetric fistula cases resulting from childbirth occurring worldwide each year is 100,000 and the treatment is greatly hampered by the lack of specialized doctors to prevent and treat the condition,&rdquo; he said.
