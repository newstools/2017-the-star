Kilifi Wiper governor aspirant Gabriel Katana has pulled out of the race after failing to meet IEBC clearance requirements.The commission did not clear him on Friday after he appeared as a candidate of two political parties - Vibrant Party of Kenya and the Wiper Democratic Movement.In an address at Kilifi social hall on Saturday, the Pwani University don claimed his failure to get clearance was politically instigated.His exit from the race is a big relief for Governor Amason Kingi, who is an ODM candidate.Political pundits in NASA's circles feared Katana would give Kingi a run for his money and that the bruising battle will split NASA and give Kilifi North MP Gideon Mung'aro an easy win.&ldquo;Kilifi people have for long aspired to see change in leadership...a leadership full of prudence and hope. Their hope was anchored in Gabriel Katana&rsquo;s candidature but today I want to make it clear that I will not be in the race because I failed to get clearance from IEBC,&rdquo; said KatanaBut he noted he has never been a member of Vibrant party and was shocked when he learned he belonged to two parties.&ldquo;I was called by IEBC and informed of the anomaly. I started the process of de-registering from Vibrant on May 16," he explained."My running mate Duncan Nyale went to the party headquarters. We wrote to the office of the Registrar of Political Parties. Unfortunately, I was de-registered from both parties and by Thursday I was trying to re-register in Wiper. The system was down and I could not get registered at the registrar."Katana said he was in Wiper with Mombasa governor aspirant Hezron Awiti before he left."I think in the process of trying to get members, he decided to pick me as his governor candidate for Kilifi. What perplexes me the most is that I was even registered with a running mate I have never had political links with," he said.IEBC records show Katana's running mate in Vibrant party of Kenya is Alphonce Mbura.&ldquo;I put the blame on political influence..my party did not act promptly. The registrar should also have found other means of sorting the matter because it&rsquo;s their system,&rdquo; he saidFour candidates have been cleared for the Kilifi county chief post. They are Amason Kingi of ODM, Kazungu Kambi of Kadu Asili, Jubilee's Gideon Munga&rsquo;aro and Benjamin Dadu of Amani National Congress.It is not clear whether James Mangi was cleared as an independent candidate as he did not answer calls or messages on his status.The front runners are Kingi, Mung&rsquo;aro and Kambi.Katana said he will soon advice his supporters on the candidate to support.More on this: Kilifi's Kamto, Kazungu Kambi unite to remove Governor Kingi in pollAlso read: Uhuru, Raila shouldn&rsquo;t tell us who to vote for, says Kilifi governor hopeful Kambi
