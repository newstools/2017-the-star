Lugari MP Ayub Savula has asked the IEBC to disqualify his ODM and Ford Kenya rivals, Nabil Nabwera and Joseph Lunani respectively, for allegedly engaging in violence.  Savula led a peaceful demonstration on Tuesday from Matete to the home of Gerishom Kwoba who was allegedly killed by supporters of his ODM opponent, Nabwera, on Monday night. The commission yesterday summoned seven politicians, including Bungoma Governor Kenneth Lusaka, for questioning.  A woman was shot dead during fracas between Lusaka and Ford Kenya governor aspirant Wycliffe Wangamati (pictured). Kwoba was stabbed several times by a person identified as John Juma, a known ODM supporter, according to Savula. Yesterday, Nabwera denied Savula’s claims, saying the MP is shedding “crocodile tears” over the death. “It is Savula who is causing this violence. It is ANC supporters who killed another and not ODM supporters as he claims,” he said.
