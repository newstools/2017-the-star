The DCI has unveiled a roadmap to address emerging crime trends and professionalise the agency.The agency has been accused of conducting poor investigations that hinder prosecutions. Some officers are said to have vested interests in cases. The 2015-2020 strategic plan launched on Friday recommends the hiring of more staff, the development of methods to avoid high turnover of officers with specialised skills. The directorate&rsquo;s forensic capacity will also be addressed. &ldquo;We intend to have more than 10,000 officers, up from the current 6,323, and fully adopted use of forensics in criminal investigation by phasing out obsolete equipment and security systems,&rdquo; Sospeter Munyi , the director of planning, said. The plan will do away with unharmonised criminal investigation procedures.
