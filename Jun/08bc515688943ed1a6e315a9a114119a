Mister Wok, a home-grown eatery popular for Chinese cuisine, has opened its first outlet out of Nairobi in the resort town of Nanyuki. The growth-hungry restaurant, which operates four branches in Nairobi, has opened a new outlet at Cedar Mall in what it says is the beginning of a national expansion drive.&ldquo;Some of our clients based in Nanyuki used to order take-outs from Nairobi or travel to dine with us. Now the cuisine is conveniently available north of the Equator,&rdquo; Mister Wok chairman Karim Hadi said in a statement yesterday. The Sh1.3 billion Cedar Mall opened doors at its 120,000-square foot first phase on December 1, last year following construction works which began on March 31, 2015. Chandarana Foodplus, Nairobi Java House, Goodlife Pharmacy, Optica and KFC are some of the more than 20 firms that have set up shops at the mall, underlining a growing demand for retail space in the town popular with holidaymakers. &ldquo;Nanyuki has become a property development hotspot owing to its growing population as a result of the town&rsquo;s popularity as a retirement location, together with a growing economy of ranching, wildlife conservation and agriculture,&rdquo; Ben Woodhams, the managing director of Knight Frank Kenya &ndash; the manager of the mall &ndash; said.
