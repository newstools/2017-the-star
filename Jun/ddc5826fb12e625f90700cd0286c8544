The Kenya Urban Roads Authority will build 50km of new roads in Meru and Tharaka Nithi, director general Silas Kinoti has said. The firm will build the roads in Maua, Meru, Chuka and Kathwana towns, he said on Tuesday.The Meru town bypasses will cost Sh3 billion and will be the second largest urban road project in Kenya after Outering Road in Nairobi that cost Sh8 billion, Kinoti said.&ldquo;We are also doing a h1 billion project for Maua town roads that did not have roads before,&rdquo; he added.&ldquo;In urban roads, one kilometre has a lot of effect. You cannot compare with rural areas because it will help address rural-urban migration as it will create jobs.&rdquo;He spoke to journalists in Maua town after inspecting the Silver Inn-Kiegoi road that is under construction.
