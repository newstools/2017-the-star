Budalang'i MP Ababu Namwamba has blasted opposition chief Raila Odinga for politicising the Sigiri bridge collapse.Speaking at the scene of the incident on Tuesday, Ababu said it is unfortunate that the Opposition leader has chosen to politicise the incident, during which lives could have been lost.The Sh1.2 billion, 25m bridge on River Nzioa, that links Bunyala North and South, collapsed on Monday morning, leaving more than 28 workers injured.

He claimed this bridge was his brain child and that he is the one who drew the plan. Let him come and carry it to where he goes," Ababu said.The legislator termed the collapse an act of sabotage by rivals, "especially those in Raila's ODM party", but reaffirmed construction will be completed before the end of the year.Raila blasted President Uhuru Kenyatta for commissioning "shoddy work" saying his regime was to blame for the unprofessional job that used a lot of money from the people's pockets.The leader, who is NASA flag bearer, further said the project was being hurried for political mileage ahead of the August 8 polls.Uhuru inspected work on the bridge when he and Deputy President William Ruto visited Budalang'i on June 14.The government has since suspended the construction, Infrastructure PS John Mosonik saying an integrity report must be submitted.Mosonik said an investigative arm of the government will look into the matter to rule out foul play.The firm executing the construction - China Overseas Engineering Co. (COVEC) - said it will take responsibility for the injured workers.The company launched the project in 2015 and scheduled its completion for July 2017. This was after 11 people perished in 2014 while crossing the River from Osieko to Budalang&rsquo;i.More on this: State suspends construction of collapsed Sigiri bridge, orders probe"JUBILEE FLOUTED TENDER LAWS"Raila also warned Jubilee against presiding over substandard projects in the country as part of campaigns.He criticised the quality of the bridge and the SGR, saying all of Jubilee's projects are time bombs since leaders involved are only interested in their scorecards.Speaking about the bridge in Siaya town on Monday, the ODM leader noted citizens need value for money, not political gimmicks.NASA flag bearer Raila Odinga addresses residents of Siaya town, June 26, 2017. /LAMECK BARAZARaula said the collapse of the bridge was a sign of Jubilee's fall on voting day as it has not conducted business the right way.He noted the bridge collapsed due to incompetence as standards specified for tender qualifications are not respected.Regretting that the government is no longer undertaking quality projects, the Opposition leader said they will be forced to review all of Jubilee's work to ascertain fitness for use.He accused the ruling coalition of only being interested in creating opportunities to loot as opposed to adhering to specifications in the bill of quantities and designs.NASA co-principal Musalia Mudavadi (Amani National Congress) said the work was not of professional standards.Mudavadi told the Jubilee administration to stop executing projects haphazardly with the aim of looking for a scorecard for the five years they have been in office.&ldquo;If the government has no project to show off in the Western region for the five years they have been in office, they should stop playing politics with the lives of our people by inspecting shoddy projects."More on this: Kenyans want your scorecard, not list of unfulfilled pledges, Nyong'o tells JubileeMudavadi regretted that the collapse of the bridge has resulted in wastage of public funds.He added it's clear the project created an opportunity for engineers under the Jubilee administration to pocket millions of shillings while constructing a low-quality bridge to endanger the lives of Kenyans.The politician dismissed Jubilee leaders for linking NASA to the collapse saying the incident strictly resulted from poor workmanship.&ldquo;Jubilee was pushing for its completion causing engineers to apply shortcuts.
