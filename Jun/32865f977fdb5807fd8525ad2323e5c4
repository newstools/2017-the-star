Garissa Governor Nathif Jama has accused his opponents of dragging his name in the mud through a fake bank statement purported to be his.The bank statement, which bears the three official names of Nathif, has been doing the rounds on social media.It shows a total of Sh5 billion was wired into the alleged governor&rsquo;s account on different dates.The amount was allegedly being wired from CBK to his personal account for personal gains. The eight-page bank statement has a stamp on each page.Some residents accused the governor of plundering public resources to enrich himself. The others questioned the authenticity of the statement.But speaking during a fundraiser for his reelection bid on Tuesday, Jama denied the accusions and linked them to his critics. He said they have always done everything to tarnish his name and frustrate him.He asked how he would authorise Sh640 million to be wired to his account at once, saying the Central Bank of Kenya would not allow such an amount to be deposited in his personal account.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s unfortunate these people can stoop so low. If they have an iota of evidence that they think they can use against me, then they should take the same to the relevant authority for action to be taken,&rdquo; Jama said.He said his opponents know this is mere propaganda and that is why they have not forwarded the information to court. &ldquo;Even if they cook lies and propaganda, then they should do it professionally,&rdquo; Jama said.
