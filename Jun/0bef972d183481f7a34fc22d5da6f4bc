President Uhuru Kenyatta did not have any private meeting with any member of either the Kenya or Dubai Chambers of Commerce, the Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry said yesterday.KNCCI chairman Kiprono Kittony told journalists that he led their Dubai counterparts to pay a courtesy call on President Uhuru at State House, Nairobi, to brief him on the areas of collaboration on trade and investment.Before the visit to the Head of State, Kittony explained, a business meeting was held at a Nairobi hotel between delegations from the two countries.On Wednesday, the Star ran a story headlined &lsquo;Dubai ballot printing firm asked Uhuru for contract&rsquo;. The story said the Al Ghurair family hosted Uhuru in Dubai and later met him in Nairobi. The family&rsquo;s firm won the tender to print ballot papers.Kittony yesterday said the Dubai delegation was led by their chairman Majid Saif Al Ghurair and the president and CEO of the Dubai Chamber of Commerce Hamad Buamin. Several Kenyan companies and a 21-member team from Dubai attended the meeting.&ldquo;Business meetings should not be confused with politics and we urge the political class to refrain from utterances that scare away investors,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;After our meeting, as has been practice with other business delegations from around the world, we paid a courtesy call on President Uhuru Kenyatta in State House. The meeting was attended by 10 people from the Dubai delegation and Kenya Chapter officials.&rdquo;Kittony said they discussed with Uhuru investment opportunities available in agribusiness, livestock, fisheries, and infrastructure.They also expounded on matters of a banking licence moratorium imposed by the Central Bank of Kenya, Fly Dubai access to Mombasa and work permits for new supermarket entrant Carrefour.&ldquo;Subsequent to the meeting held in Nairobi on May 24 this year, our national vice chairman Laban Onditi signed an MoU with our Dubai counterparts to open their office in Nairobi,&rdquo; Kittony said. He said they also recently held business forums with German, US, South African, Qatari, Saudi Arabian and Nigerian Chambers of Commerce over areas of cooperation.&ldquo;It is common practice across the continent during the business delegation meetings to host business-to-business meetings with host country businesspeople as well as pay a courtesy call on the country leadership to brief them on areas of collaboration,&rdquo; Kittony said. On Wednesday, IEBC chief executive Ezra Chiloba denied attending a meeting at State House, Nairobi, with one of Al Ghurair Printing &amp; Publishing bosses and President Uhuru before a Sh2.5 billion tender to print ballot papers was awarded to the firm.Chiloba yesterday denied reports he was involved in cracking a deal for the tender, terming them &ldquo;political gossip&rdquo;.&ldquo;You should ask yourself whether I was in State House during that meeting before asking whether I was given any instructions by anyone. That is what we call political gossip going on and there is nothing like that,&rdquo; he said.NASA has called for his resignation and the firm&rsquo;s disqualification.
