Kenya hockey Union Premier League champions Telkom Orange have fixed their eyes on winning the 2017 edition undefeated. The Jos Openda-led side sits top of the table with 24 points from their eight matches, three better of second-placed USIU-A, who have won seven and lost one. Telkom will be looking for their ninth win when they face a struggling Multimedia University, who have just three points after one win in seven matches. On paper, Multimedia have no chance if Telkom’s 6-0 and 8-0 hammering of Jkuat and Sliders in their respective lat two matches is anything to go by. “ We are taking every chance we have. As champions we are going to every game focused on a win to help us retain our title but we can’t underrate any opponent,” said Telkom captain Tracy Karanja. Kenya Police, who dropped points for the first time this season in a 3-3 draw against Wazalendo,take on USIU-A tomorrow. The draw against Wazalendo ended the former 2013 champions’ good run of 10 straight wins and they will be seeking to bounce back to wining ways. Police top league with 31 points from 11 matches while their opponents are placed 10th with nine points, having played eight matches.
