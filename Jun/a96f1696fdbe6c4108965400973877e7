KCB skipper Curtis Lilako has been recalled to the Kenya Simbas squad for the upcoming matches against Uganda.The burly prop was omitted from the initial 36-man squad named in March.Team manager Wangila Simiyu said: &ldquo;Lilako returns to the squad on merit. He has worked hard at club level and has been an integral part of his team&rsquo;s league and cup double this season.&rdquo;Simiyu added that rookies Steve Otieno of Homeboyz and Nondies&rsquo; centre Ben Marshall are in contention for a place in the traveling 23-man squad that leaves on Thursday for Uganda. The two played for the Kenya under-20 team at the Africa Cup in Madagascar recently and have been impressive for their clubs in the just concluded Kenya and Enterprise Cup tournaments.&ldquo;We have been impressed with their attitude, commitment and spirit during training and they will certainly get their chance on the big stage,&rdquo; added Simiyu.Lilako was last in action for the Kenya Simbas last year in August in a 34-10 win over Hong Kong at the RFUEA ground. Simiyu said areas of improvement for the side in the two matches against Uganda included the scrummaging and defensive alignment.&ldquo;We resumed training last week and worked hard to sort out our issues at scrum time. We sharpened our line-out and improved our defensive alignment especially getting out of our 22,&rdquo; noted Simiyu.The tactician said he expects a stern examination from the Ugandans in both matches. &ldquo;The Ugandans are a physical side and play with intensity so we must match them up front and use our strength in the backs to play an expansive game,&rdquo; added Simiyu. The second leg match will be played on June 24 at the RFUEA ground.Kenya were triumphant in both encounters last year, winning 48-10 in Kampala and 45-24 in Nairobi to retain the Elgon Cup. Simiyu said history will count for nothing in Saturday&rsquo;s clash.&ldquo;We expect a tough encounter and past results will not matter. We have learnt our mistakes against Germany and you will see improvement against Uganda,&rdquo; added Simiyu.The team to face Uganda will be named tomorrow.
