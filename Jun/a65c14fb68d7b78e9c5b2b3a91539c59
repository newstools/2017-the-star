Taita Taveta governor aspirant Granton Samboja was questioned by Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission detectives yesterday about issues touching on his integrity.The former radio presenter, who is running on the Wiper ticket, is alleged to have falsified his academic documents and filed false declaration forms with the commission.Samboja was ordered to appear before the commission for further questioning tomorrow.The detectives also questioned Patrick Odipo, an MP candidate for Suna East constituency.Odipo, who is running on the ANC ticket, is also said to have integrity issues.The allegations against him include falsification of academic papers, impersonation and submission of false declaration forms to the commission.Odipo is expected to record further statements with the commission later.Chapter Six of the Constitution focusses on Integrity and Leadership and prohibits public office holders or people aspiring to hold public office from engaging in acts that put their integrity to question.These include being dishonest, having a conflict of interest in the execution of public duties, impersonation of a state officer and making false declarations on any personal interest that may conflict with public duties.The allegations on which Samboja and Odipo were questioned, if true, are in breach of the provisions of the chapter.If found guilty, the duo could be disqualified from contesting.Apart from making declarations to the EACC on matters deemed of public interest, aspirants are also expected to sign the Electoral Code of Conduct provided by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission.The code is a set of rules that all candidates and political parties must adhere to in the run-up to, during and after the election.Candidates or political parties that flout it can be fined or disqualified from contesting at the upcoming election or future polls.On Thursday last week, the IEBC slapped Bungoma Governor Kenneth Lusaka of Jubilee Party and his rival Wycliffe Wangamati of Ford Kenya with a Sh1 million fine each over chaos that erupted in the county.The commission held the two responsible for the June 2 chaos when their rowdy supporters clashed after the two were cleared to contest.The violent clash caused the death of one person.The commissions have promised to be tough on those who violate the laid-down rules.
