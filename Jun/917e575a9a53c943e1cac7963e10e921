Jubilee Coast region point man and Kilifi North MP Gideon Mung&rsquo;aro (pictured) has intensified his campaigns as he seeks to clinch the governor seat. Last Sunday, he expressed confidence he will win and deliver votes for Jubilee. Mung&rsquo;aro said he will transform Kilifi if elected. He will traverse all wards during his campaigns. Mung&rsquo;aro accused incumbent Amason Kingi of failing to use the billions allocated to the county by the national government. He said Kingi has wasted funds meant for development, making residents unable to see the fruits of devolution. Speaking during a meeting with leaders from Ganda ward, Malindi constituency, Mun&rsquo;garo said Kingi is riding on the ODM party to lure voters. Kilifi is viewed as an ODM stronghold, where residents usually vote using the six-piece pattern.
