The Elgeyo Marakwet government will not promote nurses or hire more medics, as it does not have the money to do so, Governor Alex Tolgos said yesterday.&ldquo;Today, I no longer have tea in my office because we have diverted operations and maintenance funds to development. We would have promoted you, but we do not have adequate funds,&rdquo; he said.This statement dealt a major blow to nurses, who have fought for the promotions since 2013 and the hiring of more medics due to an acute shortage.The nurses, led by Elgeyo Marakwet KNUN secretary general Benson Biwott, took to the streets of Iten on Thursday last week, demanding promotions.A nationwide nurses&rsquo; strike began on June 5 and enters its 17th day today.Tolgos said, &ldquo;At times, I go to Nairobi for official duty with my aides, but we are forced to use money from our pockets for meals due to shortage of funds to pay for per diems.&rdquo;He told the nurses his administration is struggling to equip CDF health centres handed over to the county.
