Two of the schoolchildren who went missing after the Tuesday's IED attack in Kiunga, Lamu East, have been found alive.Eight people, four schoolchildren and four police officers, were killed during the attack believed to have been orchestrated by al Shabaab militants.On Tuesday, four pupils were reported missing. Two are still missing.About 17 people are said to have been injured.Reports also indicate al Shabaab used an IED to hit a police lorry in Kiunga on Tuesday evening, before spraying it with bullets.The attackers vanished in the nearby Boni Forest.Police are yet to make any arrests.The pupils were among a group of 14, who hiked a lift from a Rapid Border Patrol Unit lorry from Mararani to Kiunga Primary School, before the lorry, which had more than 20 police officers, ran over a landmine in Ota.The children are from different primary schools in Lamu East, especially from the Boni community in Basuba.A police source claimed security agents were warned of a possible attack by al Shabaab last week within Kiunga after about 100 militants were spotted by locals.&ldquo;The IED destroyed the lorry before al Shabaab, who were hiding in the forest, opened fire to maximise the impact of the attack and increase the fatalities,&rdquo; a senior officer said.The two school pupils, who were rescued and evacuated by police and the Kenya Red Cross Society personnel were rushed to hospital in critical condition. They are still admitted in private hospitals.Lamu East subcounty administrator Shee Kupi said one pupil was found late Tuesday evening and had serious injuries in the head and burns in the face.The other student was discovered in a thicket close to the scene of the attack on Wednesday morning and had broken legs.He said the two, who are in critical condition, have been airlifted to the Magogoni Naval Base in Lamu and there are plans to have them airlifted to Nairobi for specialised treatment.&ldquo;We have found two of the missing pupils who all have suffered serious injuries. Two others are still missing," Kupi said.Noah Mwavanda, who is in charge of the Linda Boni Operation, said due to the nature of the road, and presence of the militants, transport is not available.He said police officers and GSU are combing the area to flush out the militants.Mwavanda also said there is a possibility the militants are planting landmines.Two weeks ago, an IED explosion killed seven Rapid Border Unit officers and a civilian while another one was detonated by KDF officers in the area.A security operation consisting of various security units has been launched to pursue the militants.Lamu county commissioner Joseph Kanyiri and the Linda Boni Operation director James ole Serian remained mum over the incident.Parents remained optimistic that with the ongoing search, the missing children will be found.Meanwhile, burial arrangements for the four pupils who died in the attack is underway at Mararani village, Lamu East.Lamu Governor Issa Timamy and Deputy Governor Eric Mugo have condemned the attack. They urged the government to secure volatile areas in the county.Timamy said terrorism is a global issue that requires concerted efforts.He pledged support for the bereaved families and the injured.&ldquo;It is so cruel when innocent children die from such acts of terrorism. We have lost our officers yet again, less than a month after the attack in Baure that claimed the lives of 10,&rdquo; Timamy said.&ldquo;I'm deeply saddened by the loss of souls of young children. May Allah rest the innocent souls in eternal peace. To our fallen soldiers, you will forever remain our heroes. Our hearts and prayers are with you all,&rdquo; Mugo said.Many areas in Lamu East, including Mararani, Kiunga, Milimani, Basuba and Kiangwe, have poor road network, making them inaccessible for vehicles plying the routes.
