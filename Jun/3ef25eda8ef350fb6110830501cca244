ODM Nairobi woman representative candidate Ether Passaris says the government is funding the Sonko Rescue Team to frustrate and undermine Governor Evans Kidero&rsquo;s administration.&ldquo;The government has failed to empower the governors, including our own governor here of Nairobi, who has had a shortage of funds neeed to do the a lot of work... and of course they are giving the other thing called the Sonko Rescue Team a lot of money on the side to do a few things here and there,&rdquo; she said.The Sonko Rescue Team, which is run by Senator Mike Sonko, a candidate for governor on the Jubilee Party ticket, was registered as an NGO last month. The team duplicates the county government&rsquo;s functions. It provides garbage collection services, sinks boreholes, supplies water to slum dwellers and offers rescue and emergency services to residents free of charge.The team has a fleet of vehicles, including a hearse, which ferries bodies upcountry and limousines and Mercedes Benz which offer free wedding services. Sonko was unavailable for comment.
