Deputy President William Ruto has done more harm to the country&rsquo;s economy than any other state officer since Independence, Homa Bay woman representative Gladys Wanga has claimed.She said Ruto has caused many economic dents in the country&rsquo;s growth, since he joined the government in 1998 as an assistant minister, leading to the current high cost of living. Wanga spoke in Aram in Rarieda on Saturday.She accused Ruto of oiling the wheels of corruption in virtually all sectors in the government for self-interest. &ldquo;The DP has no moral authority to question NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga&rsquo;s track record. Raila performed well in all the positions he held,&rdquo; Wanga said.She said Ruto has been in the government longer than Raila.Wanga said one cannot talk of corruption without linking the DP, either directly or indirectly.Wanga said Raila left a legacy that the current government is struggling to match.
