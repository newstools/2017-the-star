A senior police officer yesterday identified in court three suspects charged with violently robbing and killing former Kabete MP George Muchai and his two bodyguards and driver.Inspector Jackson Njau said Erick Muyera Isabwa alias Chairman, Raphael Kimani Gachii alias Kim Butchcher and Kimani Anyonyi alias Mustafa were the ones picked by witnesses during an identification parade at a Nairobi police station.He told trial magistrate Francis Andayi at the Milimani law courts that he was instructed to conduct the parade of the two, &ldquo;who were positively identified by the witnesses&rdquo;.The officer said he informed the suspects of their rights to choose their own position of standing in-between other members of the public before calling the witnesses to identify any suspect who may have been involved in the robbery.Muchai and bodyguards Kimathi Kalikia and Lekakeny Matanta and driver Ituu Wambugu were killed on the night of February 6-7, 2015 on Kenyatta Avenue, Nairobi. The gang allegedly used 17 live rounds and a G3 gun.The seven accused persons are Gachii, Anyonyi, Stephen Asiliva Lipapo alias Chokore, Isabwa, Jane Wanjiru Kamau alias Shiro, Margaret Njeri Wachiuri and Simon Wambugu Gichamba. They have denied the charges.The court heard that among the witnesses who identified the accused persons was one Gladys Waithera, a finance adviser with the British America Insurance Company.She told the court she was carjacked at gunpoint by four armed men as she approached her gate in Wangigi. Waithera identified the suspects by their voices. Earlier, Ronald Nyangares Siango, a prosecution witness and a vendor at the Uhuru Highway-Kenyatta Avenue roundabout, told the court that the deceased were killed by one gunman.Siango said the robber started firing at the driver&rsquo;s window of Muchai&rsquo;s car.He said at 2.40am, Muchai and the other three drove from University Way to town but stopped by him, called him by his nickname Kisii and told him to bring four copies of newspapers &mdash; the Daily Nation, the Star, Standard and the Nairobian.Sirengo said as he handed the newspapers to Muchai, who had been his customer for seven years, he saw a white saloon car block the MP&rsquo;s vehicle. A man wearing a mask came out of the vehicle armed with a G3 rifle and started firing at Muchai&rsquo;s vehicle with more eight bullets, he said.Siango said he ran for safety to Parliament Buildings and while there, he could still hear gunshots from the scene of crime.He lost two teeth and got several body injuries during the incident. Siango recorded his statement with the police two weeks later after being treated at a city hospital.
