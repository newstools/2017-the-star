Konga followed his mother obediently wherever they went. Being a baby Kongoni (coke&rsquo;s hartebeest), he needed her milk to keep him growing strong. One day, the herd wandered towards a different area. Mother saw a strange-looking object and swallowed it whole, then she fell down, making a gasping noise. Konga bleeted frantically for help but none came. His mother gasped her last breath and lay still. Konga stood bleating desperately, but she lay frozen in death, choked by a plastic bag.When driving through the city, there are various places where the pollution levels are extreme. For example in Industrial Area on Enterprise Road, residents of a large slum dump their waste next to the road. Huge piles of rubbish accumulate over a short period of time. It is clear to me that much work is required by the Nairobi City Council to have an effective waste management system. The city cannot wait for 2030 for such order to be achieved. The time to act is now!Each day becomes a new challenge for the animals and plants that try to live beside the growing city. This is a time like no other, in which all citizens need to play a responsible role in controlling the pollutants that stem from our lifestyles. One such pollutant is PLASTIC bags. Apart for looking ugly as litter, plastic also kills animals and children. Large supermarket groups like Nakumatt, Uchumi and Tuskys need to stop using plastic bags. They should change their policy to be environmentally friendly by ensuring re-usable shopping bags or brown plastic bags. Help stop litter pollution today for a better tomorrow! Be proud of a clean, green Nairobi!
