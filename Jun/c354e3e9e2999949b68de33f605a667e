Kenyans have been urged to reclaim and exploit vast unproductive lands to reduce migrations and manage conflicts arising from drought and desertification. Environment CS Judi Wakhungu said on Friday that making land productive can play a significant role in turning the growing tide of migrants abandoning their unproductive land. They can become communities and nations that are stable, secure and sustainable, she said. Saturday is the World Day to Combat Desertification. Wakhungu said conserving land improves sustainable livelihoods. The day is being marked in Marsabit county. This year’s global slogan is Our Land-Our home-Our Future. severe drought The CS said the county and its famous Chalbi desert have faced severe drought, causing community migrations. “Celebrating this day at Marsabit will create an opportunity for promoting awareness about combating desertification and addressing human suffering, land degradation and drought,” she said in a statement. Prof Geoffrey Wahungu, the National Environmental Management Authority director general, said the vast Marsabit county has a harsh climate, with extremes in the Chalbi desert. Those conditions frquently force the mainly pastoral communities to migrate in search of pasture. Pastoralists from Marsabit migrate to other counties and sometimes as far as Ethiopia. These movements sometimes create conflicts, Wakhungu said. She said Nema has been working with the Kenya Red Cross through the Adaptation Fund programme to increase community resilience to desertification and drought in Waldaa. “The project is making a significant impact on community livelihoods and is a clear demonstration of the possibilities of turning unproductive land to stable land,” Wahungu said. She urged counties to gazette the County Environment Committee, which is critical for promoting environment conservation. “We will carry out the necessary training for the gazetted committee members to arm them with skills,” Wakhungu said.
