President Uhuru Kenyatta has urged Kenyans to vote for him in the August polls and avoid divisive NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga.Uhuru urged Raila to shun divisive politics and said Kenyans have the right to live anywhere they wish.He said Raila&rsquo;s utterances at Kajiado were uncalled for.&ldquo;Your home is where you are currently living, and all Kenyans have a right to live anywhere they wish in this country,&rdquo; Uhuru said at Nkubu town, South Imenti, on Friday, where he led a two-day vote-hunt campaign in Meru town.On June 16, Jubilee Party wrote to NCIC chairman Francis Kaparo, asking him to investigate Raila for hate speech. This followed comments by the NASA presidential flagbearer during his tour of Kajiado county.Raila asked the residents to protect their lands and not sell them to &lsquo;outsiders&rsquo;. Uhuru said Raila&rsquo;s &lsquo;10-million-strong&rsquo; slogan shows he does not value all Kenyans.&ldquo;The Kenyan population is about 45 million and the Jubilee government will work for all Kenyans, not just the 10 million,&rdquo; he said.The President urged Raila to stop taking credit for the SGR.During his visit to Meru last week, Raila said Jubilee should not boast about the SGR as it is not its project.&ldquo;They have been bragging about building the best railway for 100 years, yet the grand coalition government that included Kibaki and myself are the ones who came up with the conception, feasibility study, design, survey award of tender and contract, which were all done when I was the Prime Minister,&rdquo; Raila said. He said Jubilee has only inflated the cost by Sh100 billion.Raila said Jubilee only revoked the tender and advertised afresh to give the contract to the same company but inflated the cost by Sh100 billion. &ldquo;If you married a pregnant woman and she gives birth while in your house will you be the father of the child? The answer is no, but you will be the stepfather. Uhuru and Ruto are stepfathers. Kibaki and I are the fathers of the SGR project,&rdquo; Raila said. But Uhuru said the Jubilee government is right to take credit for the project.
