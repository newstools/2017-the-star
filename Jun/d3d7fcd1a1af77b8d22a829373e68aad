Gospel singer Betty Bayo is set for a 12-state tour of the US, beginning September this year. Speaking exclusively to Word Is, Betty said, "I am ready with the blessing from God, to again spread his word to my fans in the US from September. I will begin in Virginia and the rest of the states will be communicated when I get there.&rdquo; Betty was speaking during her mega-packed homecoming bash, which she threw at Karuri grounds in Banana recently.&ldquo;I had to come home, given that it is long since I was here. My mother told me that I left Banana when I was two years old. I never knew my roots and this was revealed in 2016, and I thought to myself, why not get in touch with my fans from my roots in a thanksgiving family day and prayer event?&rsquo;&rsquo; she said.The family fun event had fans from all walks of life, including grey-haired men and women, youth in dreadlocks and young ladies tagging along with their sweethearts.During the homecoming, she donated a hundred school uniforms for Karuri and Kibathi Primary Schools, a set of a hundred pairs of shoes and sanitary towels to girls from the same schools.Among the artistes who joined Betty were Shiru Wa GP, Ringtone, Ben Githae and Jose Gatutura of the Thie Ukiumaga (go drying) fame.
