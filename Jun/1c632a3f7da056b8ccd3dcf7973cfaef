A blame game has started among Mandera politicians over close to 50,000 voters who risk being locked out of the August 8 election after their names were removed from the register.The tussle pitting Mandera Jubilee leaders led by Governor Ali Roba and members of the Economic Freedom Party is likely to lock out, among others, Mandera governor hopeful Hassan Noor, Senator Billow Kerrow and nominated MP and Senate aspirant Hassan Osman. Their names are missing from the register.The IEBC allegedly reversed the transfers, which were made during the last mass voter registration, a matter that Kerrow&rsquo;s faction has protested, claiming it favours one clan.The IEBC has downplayed the claims, saying there was a timeline for the confirmation of the voters register, hence their complaints are time-barred.Last week, a faction of the county leaders led by Kerrow said they will move to court to block the IEBC from interfering with the list.Roba had filed a complaint with the IEBC over the mass voter transfer, accusing the Garre Council of Elders&rsquo; of being behind the plot.Yesterday, a press conference convened by Governor Roba on the same was cancelled at the last minute. Roba promised to issue a statement today.&ldquo;We have been meeting and realised we need more time to deliberate. We will issue a statement tomorrow on these weighty issues,&rdquo; Roba said.
