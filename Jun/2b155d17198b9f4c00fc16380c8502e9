PERHAPS the most impressive manifesto that I have ever seen here in Kenya is that which was released by the Ford-Asili leader Kenneth Matiba, who was the runner-up in the first presidential election of the multiparty era in 1992.It is not clear whether its content reflected the many days that Matiba had nothing to do but think, when he was a political detainee of the single party state under President Daniel Moi. This is possible, because, prior to his incarceration, Matiba had been a Cabinet minister; and before that a top corporate figure; and even earlier, a top civil servant; while all along being, famously, one of Kenya&rsquo;s richest tycoons.A background like that would give a man a lot of useful insights into what is needed to move the country forward.Whatever the case, one of the outstanding features of that manifesto was the need for a long-term water management plan for the whole country. All kinds of projects aimed at tapping Kenya&rsquo;s existing water resources and deploying such resources on giant irrigation projects featured alongside regularizing the supply of clean drinking water to every corner of the country.Three current (and highly controversial) water-management projects &ndash; in Murang&rsquo;a, in Kericho, and the Galana-Kulalu irrigation projects &ndash; are right out of the Matiba playbook.The recent long drought and the vicious tribal fighting in the Northern rangelands; the current shortage of maize flour; the water rationing in Nairobi; all these speak to Matiba&rsquo;s foresight into what this country needed.But here is the odd thing: None of this had any direct impact on the votes Matiba was to receive in the 1992 election. Despite the circulation of hundreds of thousands of these Ford-Asili manifestoes all over the country, when it came to the ballot box, the bulk of votes cast for Matiba came from his own hard-core supporters in Central Kenya, along with a good chunk of the Western Kenya vote, which came courtesy of his party&rsquo;s Secretary General, political firebrand Martin Shikuku, now deceased.This outcome established for all time one of the iron laws of Kenyan politics: That whereas the public loves to see these manifestos and will use them to hold the eventual winner accountable, when it comes to actual votes, the only thing that counts is the regional alliances formed by each political party (or coalition).
