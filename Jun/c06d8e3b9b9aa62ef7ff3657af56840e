The keeper is experienced but somehow failed to make a decision quickly enough and we were punished in the process,&rdquo; said Omondi. &ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s getting harder now as this is our fourth loss. Remember the whole of last season we only lost four matches so we need to go back to the drawing board and check on our setbacks. But we need to learn to pick points now. We should at least have picked a point from this game.&rdquo;Team captain and defensive midfielder Kevin Oreso rose to the occasion at the added extra minutes of the game to score the winner, sending the whole place into a frenzy. In another match, veteran marksman Francis Thairu was twice on the mark as Kawangware beat newcomers Zamalek 3-1.Kola Ganusis scored the winner ten minutes from time for the West Conference leaders, who kept their 5-point lead intact at the top of the 16-team column.
