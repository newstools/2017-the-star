More than 3,000 farmers are expected to receive cows during the distribution of the second batch of animals worth Sh12.8 million in Kisumu county.The beneficiaries - small-scale subsistence farmers and members of registered groups - will receive a total of 80 dairy cows and 72 goats.Kisumu Governor Jack Ranguma said the farmers should ensure they have adequate pasture and water and take up zero grazing.Ranguma said the county recognises the role of agriculture sectors development in uplifting the socio-economic status of residents.He said the initiative is a major component of a strategy to make the county self-reliant in milk production.Ranguma said the current milk production is estimated at 27 million litres against a demand of 70 million litres. This leaves a deficit of 43 million litres.The deficit is met by importation from other counties, including Bomet, Nandi and Kericho, he said.Ranguma said the initiative will improve food security, increase residents&rsquo; income and create jobs for the youth.He said the county has encountered challenges which include a lengthy procurement process and competition with the other counties.Last year, the county bought 82 dairy cows and 70 goats at Sh13.2 million. It also bought 150 hives at Sh1.6 million. &ldquo;We have been able to help 3,000 families and realise a 20 per cent increase in milk yields,&rdquo; Ranguma said. He said more fund will be allocated to the initiative.
