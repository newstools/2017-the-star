Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka on Monday found himself in the middle of the tough duel for Kitui governor contest between incumbent Julius Malombe and former CS Charity Ngilu.Ngilu supporters shouted down Malombe and forced him to cut short his speech during a Wiper rally in Kabati trading centre, Kitui West, where Kalonzo was the chief guest.Host MP Francis Nyenze at some point attempted to calm down the crowd shouting at Malombe, but they did not calm down and instead hoisted Ngilu campaign posters.The governor pleaded with them, &ldquo;Please keep on raising Ngilu&rsquo;s campaign portraits, but also listen to what I have to tell you.&rdquo; But they would not let him talk.He then left the podium. However, the same welcomed Ngilu with chants of &lsquo;Mama Sasa, Maisha Mapya&rsquo; &ndash; Ngilu&rsquo;s campaign slogan.Kalonzo said it was wrong for his meeting to be turned into a popularity contest between governor candidates.He said he and Ngilu will work together to ensure NASA victory on August 8.
