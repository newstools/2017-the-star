Fishermen on Kao beach on the shores of Lake Victoria in Nyatike subcounty yesterday threatened to lynch six fishmongers accused of being witches.The women were forced to flee from an irate mob after being accused of having the evil eye.They blamed the group for the death of a woman on the beach last Friday. She was allegedly bewitched in Kakelo-Kakoth sublocation.Chief Sospeter Oloo said the deceased, who operated a hotel on the beach, died shortly after complaining of a stomach ache, a condition the locals blamed on the six.&ldquo;The charm is believed to be always passed when the victim is eating food and locals fear more deaths and have threatened to lynch them when they come back,&rdquo; he said.Oloo said the fishermen's threat is real and they are investigating the claims.
