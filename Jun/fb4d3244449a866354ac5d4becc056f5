Kenya Power yesterday announced a new online payment solution aimed at helping commercial customers manage and settle post-paid power bills.Dubbed Corporate Pay, the app enables medium to large commercial customers to manage and have oversight of post-paid electricity bills.The product, developed by Stanbic Bank, enables users to consolidate bills which are due from multiple accounts to generate one e-slip for single payment with real time credit to the multiple accounts. Head of transactional products and services at Stanbic Bank Joe Alaro said that previous manual management of multiple accounts often leads to late or missed payments, and subsequent power disconnections that negatively impact on productivity.&ldquo;Our goal is to offer quality electricity supply to meet demands of personal as well as corporate and industrial clients. The roll out of Corporate Pay in partnership is a welcome development as this will facilitate convenient management of bills for our customers and enable operational efficiency,&rdquo; said Harun Karisa, Kenya Power&rsquo;s acting general manager for Finance.
