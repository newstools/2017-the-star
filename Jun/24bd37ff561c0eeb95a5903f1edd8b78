Export Promotion Council has signed a five year working agreement with the Coast Development Authority, to spur export of commodities in the coastal region.According to chief executive of EPC Peter Biwott, the MOU will enable the two institutions to carry out market research within the coast, and work on regional value chain development of agricultural produce and fish in the region in readiness for export markets.&ldquo;Regional development Authorities are a hub for value chain development and thus a critical focus of the Exports Promotion Council for partnership as we assemble a critical mass to stimulate exports and address our trade deficit challenge in Kenya,&rdquo; he said in an interview with The Star. Kenya exports on average have been growing at nine per cent for the last decade while imports have grown at a rate average of 11 per cent according to government data.He said the country needs to address the export trade deficit if it is to meet its target of reducing the deficit by 50 per cent by 2030.&ldquo;In our projection for Kenya to reduce trade deficit by 50 per cent by 2030, we have to grow our exports annually by at least 14 per cent.&rdquo; Domestic exports grew by 1.37 per cent in 2016.He said the MOU will address the problem of scarce resources within both public and private sector agencies, including technical and financial shortfalls.In the past month, EPC has signed partnerships with regional development authorities, notably with Kerio Valley Development Authority and have undertaken conducting meetings and training programs with business communities in counties.
