Nurses have given the state new calculations showing their Collective Bargaining Agreement will cost only Sh28 billion over four years.They disputed the Sh40.3 billion bill quoted by Council of Governors chairman Josephat Nanok, saying it was meant to scare the public.The new figure came up during a meeting between officials of the Kenya National Union of Nurses and Health PS Julius Korir.KNUN deputy secretary general Maurice Opetu said the new allowances would cost the government only about Sh7.25 billion every year, and benefit more than 30,000 nurses.&ldquo;This is because the allowances are not uniform and are staggered among cadres, specialties and regions,&rdquo; he told the Star.Opetu accused the government of looking down on nurses, saying other public workers have received more. &ldquo;The 5,000 doctors received Sh8 billion a year, the teachers have received Sh54 billion. Why is it a problem when nurses ask for Sh7.25 billion?&rdquo; Opetu said.The nurses also rejected a request to renegotiate the CBA. Opetu said they will hold another peaceful protest on Wednesday in Nairobi.The CBA would have been effected on July 1 and remain in force for four years.The strike by the 26,000-member union enters day 26 today.
