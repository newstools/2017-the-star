Ex-FBI chief James Comey will tell Congress on Thursday President Donald Trump wanted a "patronage relationship" and asked for his "loyalty".According to his opening statement, Comey will also testify the president asked him to drop an inquiry into fired National Security Adviser Mike Flynn.He says Trump called the Russian probe "a cloud" over him.Comey also says he had told Trump three times he was not under scrutiny, confirming the president's account.Reacting to the prepared testimony on Wednesday evening, Trump's private legal counsel on the Russia inquiry, Marc Kasowitz, said the president was "pleased" Comey had confirmed he was not in investigators' crosshairs."The president feels completely and totally vindicated," said the attorney.But in Thursday's Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, Comey will detail how Trump made him uncomfortable during a series of encounters leading up to the FBI director's firing on 9 May.It is one of the several congressional panels that, along with the Justice Department, is investigating US intelligence assessments that Russian hackers meddled in last November's presidential election in an effort to help Trump beat Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.The inquiries are also investigating whether any Trump campaign officials colluded with the alleged Kremlin plot, which Moscow has repeatedly denied.According to seven pages of prepared testimony, Comey will say his first meeting with the president occurred on 6 January in a conference room at Trump Tower, where Comey briefed him alone on "salacious and unverified" allegations about him.A dossier compiled by a former British intelligence official had claimed the Russian security services possessed compromising material on Trump, including that he had been recorded consorting with prostitutes at a Moscow hotel.Comey's statement says the president "expressed his disgust for the allegations and strongly denied them" during a subsequent meeting.That denial came in a one-to-one dinner on 27 January at the White House, Comey will say, adding that he had a "very awkward conversation" with the president that evening.It's like a sneak preview of a blockbuster movie - this opening statement should be preceded with a "Spoiler Alert!" warning.Comey is going to largely confirm all the reports that were circulating in the media about what took place during his private meetings with the president - the talk of loyalty, the pressure on the FBI to ease off its Flynn investigation, the multiple requests for public confirmation that the FBI was not targeting Mr Trump himself.While Comey casts the president in a less-than-flattering light, he does shy away from directly accusing the president of obstruction of justice. Much will be made of how the two men may have interpreted the phrase "honest loyalty" differently. In addition, Comey viewed the president's Flynn request as only relating to his conversations with the Russian ambassador and not the investigation as a whole.That may not matter much, however.Large portions of the former director's account is in direct contradiction to Trump's version of their meetings. It sets up a "he said, he-said" situation - but Comey has memos and conversations with other FBI officials to buttress his case.What's more, if recent polls are any indication, the American public trusts him more than the president. Comey's performance under questioning - particularly if Mr Trump responds angrily via Twitter - could further sour the public mood.Trump asked the FBI director during the discussion in the Green Room whether he wanted to stay in his job, Comey will testify.He will say he found this "strange" because Mr Trump had already told him twice in earlier conversations that he hoped he would not step down.The former FBI director will testify the question "concerned me greatly" because he felt the dinner was an effort to "create some sort of patronage relationship".
