The Anglican Church in Murang&rsquo;a has elected a new bishop.Archdeacon Timothy Gichere was elected after John Miano and Wilson Burugu stepped down in his favour.The two said the church is more important than individuals and that they do not want to put the diocese through a rigorous process.Miano, the diocesan administrative secretary, said after intensive deliberations, he decided to step down for Gichere to ease the process.&ldquo;Gichere is able and competent to lead this diocese and I have decided to support and pray for him,&rdquo; Miano said. Burugu, the diocesan education secretary, on the other hand, said all three have been great friends and that they should have saved the church the trouble by stepping down when the elections hit the rocks last year.The elections started in June last year but were called off after some of the 11 aspirants raised concern that the process was flawed.Some church members headed to court before the then archbishop, Eliud Wabukala, post-poned the elections indefinitely and appealed for the court case to be withdrawn.Sources within the church, however, indicated that it is not known on whose behalf the members went to court.The sources also indicated that the case that is still ongoing at the Milimani law courts was heard on Friday. The complainants unsuccessfully sought to have the elections stopped.Wabukhala appointed Allan Waithaka last November to serve as the interim bishop until the church elected a bishop.Waithaka retired last month and had a farewell ceremony in which Archbishop Jackson ole Sapit asked the bishop aspirants to lobby for support with humility.Sources indicated that the three had conducted intensive lobbying among members of the Electoral College charged with electing a bishop.&ldquo;The kind of lobbying that had been done would have brought sharp divisions in the church had the two not stepped down,&rdquo; the source said.Gichere, however, appealed for peace and reconciliation among members of the church, saying the electoral process is over and that it is time to bring the church together.In his maiden speech, Gichere praised his two opponents for foregoing their calling to support him and pledged to lead the diocese through God&rsquo;s guidance.&ldquo;I appreciate that the two had been recommended by the search committee but they chose to put the church first,&rdquo; the new bishop said.&ldquo;We have come to the end of lobbying for support and it is now time to join hands and serve the diocese with peace and unity.&rdquo;
