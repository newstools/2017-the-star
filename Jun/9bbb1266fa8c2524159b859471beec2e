KCB coach Curtis Olago has been handed a 30-week ban for attacking a match referee last year. Olago’s lengthy ban could be detrimental to the bankers’ chances of reclaiming the national sevens series which start next month as well as their Kenya Cup and Enterprise Cup title defence later in the year. According to a ruling done by the Independent Judicial Committee dated June 6, Olago is said to have confronted and abused match referee Mwangi Karimi following a Kenya Cup match between Nakuru and KCB on April 16, 2016 citing bias. Nakuru won the game 21-13 in a tempestuous match. The duo were to meet again during the national sevens series circuit in September last year where Olago continued with his tirade against the match officials from th Kenya Rugby Referees Society. According to the submissions, it is said that Karimi was then pulled away by one of the players and other members of the KCB RFC technical bench. The Willy Ombisi-led judicial committee with Aggrey Chabeda and Bernard Itebete as members further heard that the Olago was to engage Mwangi at a popular entertainment spot in Kisumu later that evening with Olago, still accusing him of bias. It had to take the intervention of KCB team manager Ronny Kangetta and a Mr.Koli to pull away Olago from the scene. In their ruling, the independent judicial committee pursuant to R20.10.1(c), the Person is suspended from all rugby activity for a period of 30 weeks, effective from the date of this decision (6 June, 2017). Olago would have seen his 30-week ban suspended for 12 months but, according to the ruling, his unwillingness to co-operate with the judicial process finds he is in breach of R.20.4(h) thereby leaving the Committee with no choice but to reinstate the ban fully and immediately. Karimi and Kenya Rugby referees argued that the conduct and behavior of Olago, though off the playing enclosure, was in connection with a match both parties had been involved in and had the potential to bring the game into disrepute and the actions of Olago did not uphold the spirit of the Laws of the Game and were in breach of clause 1.2 of the Code of Conduct. Meanwhile, Resolution Kisii’s Abel Mong’eni was handed a 34 week ban backdated to April 18. Mong’eni was found guilty of attacking referee David Ng’etich at the close of the side’s KRU Championship 6-3 semifinal win over USIU on April 8.
