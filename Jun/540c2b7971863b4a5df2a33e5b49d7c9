President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday told NASA leaders to stop misleading Kenyans that they will implement free secondary education in September if they win the August election.He said implementation of government projects requires proper planning and not mere politicking.&ldquo;Leaders should not just wake up in the morning and tell Kenyans that they will do this and that within a given period after they win elections, without thinking or planning how to go about such issues,&rdquo; Uhuru said.&ldquo;Former Prime Minister Raila Odinga knows very well that when a policy is made, it requires planning. He should, therefore, not mislead Kenyans on implementation of projects just to attain his selfish ends.&rdquo;He made the remarks when he met his supporters at stopovers along the Nakuru-Nairobi highway, winding up a three-day tour of Nakuru county.Uhuru addressed residents of Free Area, Kikopey, Gilgil and Naivasha, among other areas.He termed it unrealistic for NASA to claim it will implement free secondary education a month after the poll.Uhuru was accompanied by Deputy President William Ruto. He said competition based on issues and policy is key to transforming citizens&rsquo; lives.&ldquo;Our colleagues in the Opposition are doing copycats on our projects and competing with us on dates and when to implement such projects,&rdquo; he said.Jubilee has promised to implement the free secondary education in January next year. Uhuru said they have to put in place proper mechanisms to ensure successful implementation.He said his administration has set aside Sh5 billion to improve schools&rsquo; infrastructure and ensure the success of free secondary education.&ldquo;NASA leaders have no agenda for Kenyans and are now thriving on politics of tribalism, hatred and confusion ahead of the next election,&rdquo; Uhuru said, urging Kenyans to be wary of leaders dividing them on tribal lines to achieve their selfish gain at the expense of the country&rsquo;s unity.He told Kenyans to be courageous and say no to ethnic-based political parties, &ldquo;which derail development and national cohesion&rdquo;.&ldquo;Kenyans should judge Jubilee by its track record. This is why I ask voters to support leaders promoting politics of unity and development and ignore those dividing us on ethnic backgrounds,&rdquo; Uhuru added.&ldquo;Leaders must be courageous to unite the people of Kenya to attain accelerated development and achieve cohesion in our country, instead of dividing them.&rdquo;He said JP is committed to peaceful elections.
