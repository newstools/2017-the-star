Kenya's first superhero animated TV series is seeking financiers to make it a reality. So far, one episode has been produced in Nairobi, with a plan to produce 47 more.The animation series follows the life of Mac, an ordinary African school kid who accidentally stumbles upon aliens extracting a special kind of substance from the Earth. Mac becomes mesmerised and, while in a hypnotic-like trance, touches the substance with his Maasai weapon. This turns Mac into Machismo!Mac learns how to turn his powers on and off and, thereby, keeps his identity as Machismo a secret to only his closest friends. The animation was one of the nine semi-finalists of the Annecy - MIFA Pitches Animation du Monde at DISCOP Abidjan early this month.Speaking to Word Is, Scolly Cheruto, who was pitching the TV series said, "The pitch went well but we did not get to the next level. We may possibly get some investors but nothing is concrete yet. However, we will pitch again in September in Johannesburg."&ldquo;The quality of projects submitted was really high and made it extremely difficult for the judges to shortlist. It is immensely encouraging to see the diversity of concepts and beautiful art being created in African animation across multiple countries," said Nick Wilson, project manager of the African Animation Network.Machismo is created by Neil Schell.
