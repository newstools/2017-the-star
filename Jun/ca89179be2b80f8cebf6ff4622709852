The Kenya Maritime Authority has distributed more than 200 life jackets to boat associations in Lamu town to encourage them to comply with maritime laws.The move is aimed at sensitising coxswains and sailors on using life jackets in day-to-day operations. Most sailors in Lamu do not use the jackets, something the KMA says substantially contributes to the high number of casualties at sea when boat accidents occur. On June 20, 10 people died when a boat capsized in the Mkanda Channel in Lamu.The 10 were part of a crew of 24 people who had boarded an overloaded dhow from Lamu town. They were heading to Ndahu Island for Eid celebrations.Only one person was wearing a life jacket.He was among the first survivors in the accident that claimed the lives of three children, five women and two men. Addressing the public at the Lamu Customs Jetty yesterday, KMA board director Ishmael Mboya urged sailors, boat operators and the public to adhere to maritime requirements.He also called on all stakeholders to cooperate with the KMA in ensuring safety at sea.
