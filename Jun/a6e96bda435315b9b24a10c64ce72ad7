Church leaders have appealed to politicians to choose their words carefully as they hunt for votes, saying careless utterances might cause chaos. They said politics of ethnic division is to blame for the tribal clashes witnessed in the past. They urged leaders not to divide Kenyans along tribal lines before, during and after August polls. &ldquo;We want a peaceful election with no bloodshed or destruction of property. It is our plea to politicians that they shun the spirit of tribalism so as not to spoil the cohesion in the country,&rdquo; said Rev David Kariuki Ngari of Calvary Chosen Centre Church in Thika on Monday. Apostle William Kimani of Kingdom Seekers Ministry said, &ldquo;We are one country and one people. We attend churches and worship together but politicians awaken tribalism that divides us.&rdquo;
