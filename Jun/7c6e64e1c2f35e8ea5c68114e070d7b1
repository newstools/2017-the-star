The volume of cane delivered to factories hit the second lowest point in April, fresh official data shows, underlining the acute shortage in the commodity leading to a spike in prices.Cane deliveries were captured at 312,360 metric tonnes, the lowest since July 2011 when the volume was 301,600 metric tonnes, data collated by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics shows.Deliveries for four months through April also fell by 33.27 per cent year-on-year to 1.76 million metric tonnes from 2.64 million tonnes.Despite &ldquo;adequate supply&rdquo; after the government allowed duty-free importation in May, sugar prices have remained high, with a two-kilo packet retailing between Sh350 and Sh390.Sugar Directorate interim head Solomon Odero on Tuesday said he could not explain why the reduction and reasonable supply of sugar are not reflecting in consumer market prices.&ldquo;From early May, we have witnessed increased supply both from local and external markets. Equally, importation cost of sugar per 50kg bag has decreased by 35 per cent and 32.6 per cent on local sugar. We are yet to understand why the price reduction has not been reflected.&rdquo; Odero said.Data from the Sugar Directorate shows that sugar imports during the four month period went up 35.48 per cent to 131,847 metric tonnes from 97,320 tonnes during the same period last year.Odero said the cost of importation has gone down from Sh8,000 to Sh5,200 for a 50kg bag since early May, while local sugar cost had decreased from Sh8,900 to Sh6,000 per bag.Kenya, which imports sugar to bridge market deficit, shipped in 334,110 metric tonnes of sugar last year, the Directorate&rsquo;s data have shown. Odera said that the number is expected to increase by 150,000 tonnes to cover the shortage brought about by the prolonged drought.In a gazette notice on May 12, the National Treasury temporarily exempted duty on imported sugar from the date of the notice to August 31 to mitigate the sugar shortage.Kenya produces about 600,000 tonnes of sugar from its 10 under-performing factories annually against a demand of 890,000 tonnes.To bridge the gap, the country imports most of its sugar from the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa region under a protection window.The monthly consumption of sugar is currently at 60,000 tonnes out of which 32,000 tonnes are supplied by local millers and the balance equated through imports from the regional market.
