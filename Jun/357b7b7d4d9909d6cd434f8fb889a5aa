Expenditure cuts will help Kenya lower her fiscal deficit by 3.9 per cent and support a relatively low inflation, economists at Sanlam Group suggested yesterday. The Group&rsquo;s investment economist Arthur Kamp said the global financial conditions were likely to tighten in the next two to four years, making it expensive to raise money internationally. Fiscal consolidation, he added, would help stabilise debt ratio. &ldquo;Kenya increasingly integrates and borrows from global capital and commercial markets and any tightening will be reflected in this markets and one does not want the level of inflation to get relatively high when the conditions tighten,&rdquo; he said. The 2017 IMF Global Financial Stability report indicates that global financial conditions account for about 20 to 40 per cent of the variation in countries&rsquo; domestic financial condition indices. &ldquo;Governments can promote domestic financial deepening to enhance resilience to global financial shocks. In particular, developing a local investor base as well as fostering greater equity and bond market depth and liquidity can help dampen the impact of external financial shocks,&rdquo; the report says. Treasury CS Henry Rotich said in March Kenya&rsquo;s fiscal deficit was likely to slow to four per cent per cent by 2020 on increased domestic revenue collection and restructuring of foreign debt.
