NASA presidential flagbearer Raila Odinga is wooing Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo and promises to reward his cousin with a handsome job if he returns to ODM.Raila extended an olive branch to Midiwo during his campaign in Gem, saying the MP is like his younger brother.They cannot afford to clash over politics, he said.Midiwo ditched ODM after losing to Elisha Odhiambo during the party primaries. He will run for reelection as an independent. But he could split the vote and hurt ODM and NASA, hence,the courtship.Raila said he will meet Midiwo to persuade him to drop his bid. &ldquo;I want Midiwo to remain and support the party. If we take power, he will be given a lucrative position,&rdquo; the ODM leader said.Midiwo has been quoted saying he is ready to ensure Raila becomes the fifth President, even if he loses as MP.But will Midiwo heed Raila&rsquo;s call and drop his ambition of gunning for Gem MP for the third time.SPAREDDuring Raila&rsquo;s campaign in Siaya county, Midiwo was the only independent Raila spared from his wrath.He lashed out at independents.In his final rally at Siaya town, Raila lashed out at Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo who is running against Governor Cornel Rasanga as an independent. Raila said Gumbo is one of the politicians he has nurtured from rags to grace.He said that going against the party that sponsored him to Parliament is &ldquo;tantamount to a curse&rdquo;.He said Gumbo has no county development agenda and he is running for selfish gains.The ODM leader asked Alego Usonga constituency residents not to repeat their mistake by electing an independent candidate as their MP.In 2013, Alego Usonga residents opted for Wiper candidate Muluan Omondi, despite the area being perceived as an ODM stronghold.Raila did not mince words on the need to elect an ODM candidate in Alego Usonga.He called ODM nominee Samuel Atandi on stage and endorsed him.&ldquo;This is the man I want you to elect as your next MP in August,&rdquo; he said amid.The Alego Usonga parliamentary race has attracted four candidates.They are Atandi (ODM), Rosemary Ogutu (Ford Kenya), Omondi (independent) and Odunga Mamba (independent).
