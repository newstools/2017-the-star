There has been a lot of hype online with regards to Adelle Onyango's sneakers, Pharrell 'Human Race' NMD. Tabloids are stating that she bought them for Sh80,000.Adelle has come out to trash those rumours, stating that people focus on the wrong things just to create hype that isn't necessary.Speaking exclusively to Word Is, she said: "I love Pharrell and what he stands for and this collaborative line of sneakers were cool. Also I love sneakers. But here is the thing. We focus on the most odd things as people and create unnecessary hype. They were not 80K because I'm not one to make dumb financial decisions, but also in the middle of everything both good and bad happening in Kenya, I think it's a waste of time to focus on the cost of Adelle's shoes."There's so much one can do with such an amount, but Adelle is not about to pour all that on a shoe. If you can spend that much, here's what I have for you:Mike Sonko has a pair that retails for a little over Sh100,000.
