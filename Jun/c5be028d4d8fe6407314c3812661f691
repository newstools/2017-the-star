Over the weekend, Kenyan socialite, Vera Sidika was in Los Angeles, the home of the stars. She partied in Jamie Foxx’s house together with mega music stars such as Chris Brown, Tyga and Trey Songz and boxing legend Floyd Mayweather, who rolled into the compound in an entourage of 20 Rolls Royce. “So Chris Brown invited up to his house party, but damn! We tired, can’s even stand in our heels,” Vera wrote on her insta-stories. She gave her fans a tour of Jamie Foxx’s house saying, “Look at all these awards, not everyone is allowed into the house except family and close friends.” The only celebrity Vera actually posed with was Trey Songz and captioned the photo, “chilling with Mr Steal yo girl.”
