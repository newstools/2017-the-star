Bootylicious socialite Risper Faith and her banana sugar plum Brian are in love. And boy do they rub that in. The ‘power’ couple have always left their counterparts from the decorated Nairobi Diaries Show dying of envy. Now, after their recent move, they will soon make some of them die of a heart attack. The reality stars have been building a house in one of the city’s suburbs and it’s almost complete. At least they have brains, compared to their fellow cast members, who are known for their loud mouths and hollow insults. The well-endowed lass has matured up and many have always praised her. Risper shared a photo of their house and caption it “See God”, leaving their critics, among them a D-list socialite who spread rumours that the two are liars, surprised. "Two heads are better than one," Risper added. Brian, who has been very supportive to his woman, also had a message to their haters. "Positive energy keep us winning."
