Just coming from the bereaved family - the husband, children and other relatives - that the postmortem revealed," Nyandarua Central OCPD Wilson Kosgei said on Saturday."The remarks by the [pathologist] was that she died due to strangulation," he added.He said the pathologist observed that Mwingi had three injuries on the head, inflicted by a blunt object.Kosgei said they are investigating the matter, adding "It is painful and concerning even to our officers.""We don't want blanket condemnation. We want investigations to be complete so we can forward the file to the DPP for advice," he said.He said the family is free to seek recourse on the matter elsewhere, but assured that the police "are very clean".Kosgei asked the family to forward Mwingi's cell phone to aid the police probe.
