ODM should withdraw all its candidates from Western or else ANC leaders will advise voters not to elect ODM candidates except for NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga, an official has said.ANC secretary general Godfrey Osotsi said the party has sacrificed a lot for ODM and the Orange Party should now reciprocate.He spoke on Saturday at Ivona Primary School, Chavakali, Vihiga county, at the launch of Sabatia MP Alfred Agoi&rsquo;s manifesto. Osotsi said if ODM pushes harder it will reduce Western votes for Raila.&ldquo;Our ODM counterparts should not have fielded candidates in ANC strongholds, especially in Vihiga and even the larger Western ... Why should ODM compete with ANC in Western?&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Voters should know that our party leader Musalia Mudavadi formed NASA, registered it and shelved his presidential ambitions for Raila Odinga.&ldquo;We are campaigning and will vote for Raila as our President, but the rest [of the leaders in Western] should be ANC.&rdquo;His sentiments disadvantage Emuhaya MP Wilbur Ottichilo (ODM), who is running for Vihiga governor against MP Yusuf Chanzu of ANC.
