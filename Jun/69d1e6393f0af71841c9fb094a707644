The Murang’a Water and Sanitation Company has embarked on a Sh16.9 million project to connect 9,000 residents with clean drinking water. Director Daniel Ng’ang’a (pictured) said the project, started last month, is being funded through a grant from the Dutch government. The project involves drawing water from the Mathioya River and distributing it to Kimathi location, considered to be semi-arid. The project will bring the total number of customers connected to water through the company to 80,000. The Kabuta-Sagana project also targets to cover Kimathi primary and secondary schools as well as Kiangatia. “We have ensured the three schools are covered in line with government policy,” Nga’ng’a said during an inspection tour of the project on Monday. He said connecting the village to water will enable it to better absorb the overflow of residents from Murang’a town.
