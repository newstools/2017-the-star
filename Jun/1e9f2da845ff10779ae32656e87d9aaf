Alego Usonga MP Omondi Muluan has warned nominated MP Oburu Oginga against meddling in constituency affairs.He said Oburu is interfering with the area&rsquo;s politics for selfish political interest.Speaking on Wednesday in Siaya town, Muluan asked Oburu to stop forcing leaders on residents and let them elect whomever they want.He was reacting to Oburu&rsquo;s remarks at a recent ODM rally in Alego Usonga, where he asked residents not to repeat the 2013 mistake of electing non-ODM candidates.Oburu advocates six-piece voting.Muluan is running for reelection against Sam Atandi of ODM, Rosemary Ogutu of Ford Kenya, Macilista Oudia of CCM and independent Odunga Mamba.Muluan was elected in 2013 on the Wiper ticket. Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo recently made remarks similar to Muluan&rsquo;s, asking Oburu to retire from politics.He said Oburu has nothing new to offer and should give way to a new crop of leaders.&ldquo;Oburu has outlived his usefulness and the honourable thing for him is to retire from active [politics] and become the chairman of retired MPs in Nyanza,&rdquo; Midiwo said. Let the people decideBut Oburu dismissed Muluan&rsquo;s accusations. He urged voters to only elect ODM to strengthen Raila Odinga&rsquo;s presidency. Muluan accused Oburu of attacking him personally since he was elected to Parliament in 2013.He said Raila&rsquo;s elder brother has nothing to show Bondo and Siaya residents, despite being MP for 19 years &mdash; compared to his successor Gideon Ochanda.&ldquo;One would struggle to identify what Oburu has done for the people of Bondo for all the years he has been MP,&rdquo; Muluan said. &ldquo;He should let the people of Alego Usonga elect their leaders based on their development track records and not their party affiliation.&rdquo;
