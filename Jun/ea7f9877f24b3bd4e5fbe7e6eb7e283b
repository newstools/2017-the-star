President Uhuru Kenyatta has appointed Amos Sipoi Ntimama as the new NGO Coordination Board chairman. In a gazette notice dated June 22, the president said Sipoi will serve for three years effective July 1. The late William Ole Ntimama’s son replaces Maj Gen Rtd Hussein Ali whose appointment to the position has been revoked. This is Sipoi’s second appointment to a prominent position. In 2016, the president appointed him to chair the Private Security Regulatory Authority, replacing former intelligence chief Michael Gichangi. In May this year, EACC kicked off a storm by claiming the board’s CEO Fazul Mohammed was unqualified to hold the office. In a gazette notice dated March 31, the commission said it had finaliSed its probe into allegations that Fazul forged a certificate to secure the job. The investigations against him were based on DPP Keriako Tobiko's recommendations on January 4.
