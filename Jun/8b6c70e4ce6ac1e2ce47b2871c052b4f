The IEBC yesterday dismissed the possibility of cancelling the ballot papers printing contract given to Al Ghurair.NASA has disputed the award of the tender to print the August 8 general election materials to the company, saying it had close links with President Uhuru Kenyatta. NASA has even threatened to pull out of the elections if the IEBC does not pull out of the contract. But IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati yesterday said it won&rsquo;t bow to NASA&rsquo;s demands.&ldquo;The position of the commission is very clear. We have given our reasons and invited NASA to give us, if there are any grounds, any evidence that the allegations they are saying are true then that can be considered,&rdquo; Chebukati said in Nairobi.
