There could be no better time for once Kenyan Premier League giants AFC Leopards to go into hibernation from Kenyan football than right now.So the SportPesa Super Cup that kicks off in Dar-es-Salaam tomorrow was a welcome excuse for Ingwe to leave town. But despite the absence of two of their key players Duncan Otieno and Robinson Kamura and the uncertainty surrounding their head coach&rsquo;s status, there will be no excuse for Leopards not to get a good result against unheralded Tanzanian outfit, Singida.After a good start to the season, Leopards have fallen away in the title race and are now closer to the relegation zone than the top&mdash;a situation that led to the soon to be confirmed departure of coach Stewart Hall. Ingwe feel the one-week sabbatical at this Sh6 million prize money tournament will give their players a chance to bond and come back refreshed before the league resumes in a fortnight.Mungai Kiongera, a familiar face in soccer-mad Dar after his stint with Simba alongside Allan Katterega and hot shot Ghanaian striker Gilbert Fiamenyo, will be expected to lead Leopards charge towards the Sh3 million winners purse. Kenyan champions Tusker will also be in action on the opening day and are expected to find the going a little tougher as they are drawn against the top team in Tanzanian right now Yanga.The brewers have hit form in just the right moment to stand shoulder to shoulder with Gor Mahia at the top of the league with 27 points each. George Nsiimeb will be hoping that his side keep up the momentum and earn him the first trophy of what he expects to be a trophy laden two years at Ruaraka.&ldquo;We have been doing well in Kenya and now we want to spread that to Tanzania. That way, we can definitely challenge for the title. I have worked in Tanzania before and I know Yanga very well. They will pose a tough challenge for us but in the end, I believe we will prevail,&rdquo; he said on the sponsors website.Other Kenyan clubs in the tourney, which ends a week on Sunday, are Gor and national Super League outfit, Nakuru All Stars.
