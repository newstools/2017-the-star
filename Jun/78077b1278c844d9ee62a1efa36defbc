Three people, including a police officer, were killed on Friday morning by gunmen in Elwak town outside Equity Bank.Northeastern regional coordinator Mohamud Saleh said the three were slain at 9am incident.Nothing was stolen from the victims and there was no bank robbery.Witnesses said four people drove towards the bank and started shooting from inside the vehicle.&ldquo;Suspected al Shabaab gunmen shot indiscriminately at the people outside the bank,&rdquo; Saleh said.The attackers sped off towards Bula Haji, near Somalia. Reports suggest the militants were on a revenge mission after two of their top commanders were killed on Monday by the Kenya Defence Forces.Al Shabaab is known to intensify attacks in the last 10 days of Ramadhan and especially on dates with odd numbers. Friday was the 23rd.Security officers pursued the attackers but no arrests had been made by press time. The victims were said to have been standing outside the bank which is usually guarded by two police officers. The other police guard was inside the bank.Saleh said police responded swiftly, but the assailants had already escaped. Witnesses said the gunmen seemed to be on a well-planned mission to attack the bank guard. &ldquo;I think the other civilians were only in the wrong place at the wrong time and they were killed because they would have identified the militants,&rdquo; a resident said.Officers from the military and regular police have cordoned off the area.Meanwhile, two people are admitted at Lafey Subcounty Hospital after their vehicle ran over a bomb on Friday morning.Mandera county commissioner Fredrick Shisia said the explosion occurred at 9.30am at Qur Qura in Lafey. He said the IED went off as the Toyota Land Cruiser with two occupants drove near it. &ldquo;The windscreens of the vehicle were completely shattered,&rdquo; Shisia said.
