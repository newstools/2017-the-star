A group of youths from Kisii county yesterday ditched ODM for Jubilee.The more than 20 youths cited frustrations by ODM and NASA as their reason for defecting.They were led by Antony Kibagendi of Kitutu Chache South.Kibagendi sought the ODM ticket for the Kitutu Chache South MP race, but lost in the primaries to Samuel Omwando.Incumbent MP Richard Onyonka is defending his seat on the Ford Kenya ticket.Kibangendi said the ODM leadership failed to resolve issues they raised.&ldquo;It was my belief that ODM and NASA would provide free and democratic space for young and progressive politicians to compete with the old order. However, the party leadership knew very well that it was using us,&rdquo; he said. They said they will campaign for President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s reelection and push the Jubilee Party agenda in Kisii county.&ldquo;Going forward, we will pursue what we believe in through the auspices of the Jubilee Party. Our efforts going forward will be to support the President and DP William Ruto,&rdquo; Kibagendi said.
