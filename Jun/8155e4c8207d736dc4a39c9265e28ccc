A West Pokot woman reportedly resurrected two hours after her husband received a three-word "miracle text" from self-proclaimed prophet David Owuor.Rosa Rotirakori from Cheparten village, South Pokot sub-county, is said to have collapsed and died on Wednesday night after a long illness.Thousands of believers from the Ministry of Repentance and Holiness, which is led by Owuor, thronged the remote village to witness the miracle."More than 300 cars arrived. Schools were closed and every activity stopped as people travelled to witness the miracle," a resident said.Rosa's husband Samson Rotirakori said she fell ill that night."She became very weak. By midnight, her condition had worsened...she was unable to walk and experienced difficulties breathing."Samson narrated that he then called a senior pastor from the ministry who asked him to send the prophet a prayer."Immediately after the phone call, Rosa stopped breathing and stretched out her hands and legs," he said.&ldquo;My wife urinated before her last breath. I then covered her with a blanket. My daughter Levine Chesang was beside her. Her body was cold and stiff and her heart had stopped beating."Chesang said she screamed immediately after her mother died, alerting their neighbour.Her father said his wife remained dead for about two hours and that it took the powers of prophet for her to return to life.Samson said at about 51 minutes past midnight, he received an SMS from Owuor saying: "It is well".Two hours later, he said, Rosa began coughing and sneezing."She came back to life and asked everyone twice: &lsquo;who has brought me back?'," he said.He held a thanksgiving ceremony that senior bishops in the ministry attended.Zachary Kasepoi, a senior deputy director of medical services, said this must have been a case of divine resurrection.&ldquo;There is no a machine in the world that can jump-start the lungs. This is a mighty miracle. I was born and educated here but this is a miracle and it should be believed,&rdquo; he said.Archbishop John Litunda said Kenyans should expect more miracles to happen through the "mightiest Prophet Owuor'.&ldquo;Two police officers have repented and joined the ministry because they believe in the prophet's miracles. Kenyans should pray for a peaceful election and police officers should trust God for a peaceful nation."Speaking to The Star after the ceremony, Rosa said she died and came back to life, and urged Kenyans to repent."I was to be buried today but I thank my prophet for bringing me back to life. I did not speak Kiswahili but after resurrecting, I can now address the media in Kiswahili,&rdquo; she said.The prophet causes a stir everywhere he goes, with his followers cleaning roads with soap and making other outrageous preparations for his arrival.More on this: 1,200 police to guard Prophet Owuor Kisumu rallyAlso read: Pastor sets himself on fire after missing spot in Prophet Owuor's Kisumu convoy
