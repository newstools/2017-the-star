Education CS Fred Matiang&rsquo;i yesterday directed the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development to revise guidelines on school text books.He says the current distribution policy gives publishers the leeway to influence school heads on which text books to buy, thereby compromising quality.&ldquo;You find that a class has five text books all published by different publishers. But when you ask, you are told they are all in the Orange Book,&rdquo; Matiang&rsquo;i said.The Orange Book, by the KICD, gives guidelines on the course books to be used for every subject.The distribution mechanism needs to be changed where only one course book is given to prevent marketers from taking advantage.&ldquo;We cannot continue operating like this. The Orange Book is neither the Bible nor the Quran. It wasn&rsquo;t written from heaven, it was designed by us,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;If we are going to put the lives of our children in the hands of profiteers, middlemen and deal makers, we are hurting their future.&rdquo; Matiang&rsquo;i said the revision will ensure schools have enough text books because money will be spent to buy approved books.Matiang&rsquo;i spoke during the launch of the Tusome midline evaluation report at the KICD.The Tusome programme was launched in 2015 in 200 schools nationally, where approximately 5,000 pupils in standard one and two were involved.The report shows the programme improved pupils&rsquo; reading performance in English and Kiswahili after having uniterrupted access to text books. The assessment was based on oral reading fluency and how many words per minute a child can read.
