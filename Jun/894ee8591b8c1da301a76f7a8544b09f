US Senate Republicans have delayed a vote on their healthcare bill until after next week's 4 July holiday.The announcement by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is a setback to their plan to replace Obamacare.Eight Republican senators have vowed to oppose the bill and the party can only afford to lose two votes to get it passed in the upper chamber.US President Donald Trump invited Senate Republicans to the White House for a meeting on Tuesday afternoon.Sitting alongside some of the party rebels, he said: "This will be great if we get it done. And if we don't get it done, it's just going to be something that we're not going to like. And that's okay, and I understand that very well."A similar version of the bill has already passed the House, after facing a similar delay.After Congress returns from the bank holiday, there will be a two-week window before the summer break.McConnell vowed to continue to try to find the votes, and would make changes to the bill if necessary.Moderate senators say the bill will harm some of their vulnerable constituents, while conservatives say it has too much government interference.The news of a delay comes just one day after the non-partisan Congressional Budgetary Office said the bill would strip 22 million Americans of health insurance over the next 10 years.
