Twelve aspirants are seeking clearance from the IEBC to run for Nairobi governor, setting the stage for a bruising battle. Six are sponsored by parties and the others running as independents.They will submit their nomination papers to IEBC officials in Kasarani Stadium today and tomorrow. The aspirants include Governor Evans Kidero, Senator Mike Sonko, former National Assembly Speaker Kenneth Marende, Raila Odinga's former adviser Miguna Miguna, Shem Owanga of Republican Liberty Party, Francis Mwanga of NAPK and Michael Mutinda of Agano Party.A fierce battle is expected between Kidero of ODM and Sonko of Jubilee Party.The two have a massive following in the city and their parties have been strategising on how to win the seat. Kidero, known for his financial muscle, will greatly rely on NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga's popularity in Nairobi. An opinion poll released on Tuesday Ipsos showed that Raila enjoys 51 per cent popularity in Nairobi against Uhuru's 39. &ldquo;Nairobi is the capital of NASA and we want to tell our opponents to prepare for a humiliating defeat in the elections,&rdquo; Kidero said.NASA partners Wiper, Ford Kenya, ANC and CCM have not fielded any candidates for the seat and will support the governor. On the other hand, President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto have thrown their weight behind Sonko, who beat former Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth in the primaries to fly the Jubilee flag. &ldquo;Please, let us elect a governor who understands the problems of Nairobi. Not one who reads them on the internet or the newspaper,&rdquo; Ruto told city residents when he and Uhuru toured Nairobi on Monday.Kenneth and Miguna will run as independents, while Marende will be running on the UDP ticket.
