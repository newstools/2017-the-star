Teso North MP hopeful Lawi Mamai (ODM) has protested against the General Service Unit pulling down his banner at his Amagoro Centre office on Wednesday. This happened a few hours before President Uhuru Kenyatta arrived for his rally at Amagoro Primary School Grounds.Mamai told the Star on the phone on Friday the action was &ldquo;barbaric&rdquo;.&ldquo;I see this as a plot by my opponent to use security agencies to intimidate NASA supporters. The same officers also harassed people at the nearby library and forced them to attend the rally,&rdquo; he said.Mamai said police also forced ODM member Peter Ipara to leave the rally. &ldquo;We cannot allow opponents to use security agencies to intimidate our people,&rdquo; he said. Mamai said attending any rally is voluntary. The culture of forcing people to attend rallies died with the old Constitution, he added. &ldquo;The rally was a political meeting and not a government function. Such intimidation makes people want a change of leadership,&rdquo; Mamai said.He said he will complain formally to the IEBC. &ldquo;The incident will not scare me in my pursuit to capture the seat. I am 100 per cent sure of winning the seat from my Jubilee opponent Arthur Odera,&rdquo; he said.Teso North police boss Onesmus Kombe was unavailable for comment as his phone went unanswered.
