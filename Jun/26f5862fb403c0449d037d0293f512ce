Coffee farmers in Kiambu have appealed to the United-for-Kiambu team to revive the cash crop&rsquo;s farming if elected on August 8 to form the next county government.Led by chairman Francis Maara, the farmers from the 23 cooperative societies in the region said coffee, once the county&rsquo;s and Kenya&rsquo;s chief export, is on the verge of extinction. He said most farmers have abandoned the cash crop.The farmers spoke on Wednesday at a meeting with Baba Yao&rsquo;s team in Gatundu North. &ldquo;Goodwill from the county government will help scrap coffee brokers who have been filling their stomachs at the expense of coffee farmers,&rdquo; Maara said.Dr James Nyoro, Waititu&rsquo;s running mate, said: &ldquo;Farmers form 60 per cent equivalent to 1.2 million of Kiambu population. We will ensure we provide farm inputs to farmers as well as extension services.&rdquo;
