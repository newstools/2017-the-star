Agriculture PS Richard Lesiyampe said yesterday that a &ldquo;responsible government&rdquo; cannot allow its citizens to feed on unsafe food, refuting concerns that uncertified food may be finding its way onto the shelves. Kenya Bureau of Standards managing director Charles Ongwae on Tuesday said all imports including rice are always accompanied with Certificates of Conformity when they arrive in the country. Ongwae said that the certificate is a confirmation that the imports have been inspected/tested against the relevant standards at source and found to meet the requirements of the respective product standards. &ldquo;Products that do not meet these requirements are issued with Non-Conformity Reports (NCR) and are rejected and not allowed to be exported to Kenya,&rsquo;&rsquo; he added. Speaking yesterday during the launch of food testing laboratory at Kebs headquarters, Lesiyampereassured that food consumed in the country must undergo testing by the standardisation agency before it is released in the market. &ldquo;There is no plastic rice and our scientists from the state agency have tested and confirmed that the rice in the market is safe for consumption. Any responsible government will not allow its citizens to feed on unsafe food,&rdquo; he said.
