Raila Odinga's calls for the implementation of the TJRC report on land continue to elicit strong reactions from the government.The NASA flag bearer has come under scathing criticism by Jubilee top brass for advising the Masaai community against selling land to outsiders in order to alleviate poverty.He said during a campaign rally in Kajiado last Thursday that should he win the elections, his administration will empower the community to stop them from selling their land.But Jubilee leaders contend that the remarks incited the Masaai community against people who have bought land in Kajiado County.Raila has since clarified that is not what he meant.In a press conference on Monday, Raila dismissed as &lsquo;absolute nonsense&rsquo; calls by Jubilee that he be probed over the remarks.He said there was nothing that he said that warrants an investigation noting that no investigating agencies have requested him to record statements.Read: Jubilee is dead-scared of NASA, Raila says in KajiadoAlso read: I don't regret Kajiado remarks, Raila says, dismisses calls for incitement probeOn Monday, Deputy President William Ruto took the war of words to social media, tweeting:&ldquo;So Tinga (Raila) believes implementing TJRC means every legitimate land buyer should go back where they came from as a way of dealing with poverty?&rdquo;The tweet had 150 likes, 112 retweets and 125 replies by the time of writing this story.Some replies to the tweet supported Ruto&rsquo;s sentiments while others were critical if not sarcastic.@lenox_magicho said; &ldquo;He means every legitimate land grabber should return the land and go wherever they came from.&rdquo;@DrMabala said; &ldquo;Tinga is always right ... prepare for a rude shock bwana DP@Evansyego8 said; &ldquo;Mr Ruto l support you 100% Raila cannot be a leader. kitendawili hatutaki &ndash; we don&rsquo;t want riddles.@ItsElvo replied; &ldquo;Tinga is confused!
