ANC Kakamega governor candidate Michael Osundwa yesterday warned Governor Wycliffe Oparanya against using his aides to frustrate his programmes, telling him to face him directly instead.He accused Oparanya of having a hand in the frustrations he faced when he presented his papers to the IEBC on Friday for clearance.The commission declined to clear him, citing lack of a resignation letter by his running mate Caleb Sunguti from the Kenya School of Government, where he lectures. The two were later cleared.ANC officials confronted an IEBC official whom, they said, called Oparanya to inform him of the rival&rsquo;s predicament. They said the official apologised and allowed them to clear with the electoral body.Osundwa told the county boss to focus on his campaigns and added that no amount of intimidation will prompt him to budge out of the race.
