PNU has suffered a blow after the Political Parties Dispute Tribunal ordered its officials to vacate office.The tribunal, in a ruling, following a petition lodged by Alphone Mbinda, said the officials were elected last year and are in office illegally.They say the officials should leave within seven days. &ldquo;The gazette notice dated April 21, in respect of the new officials of the interested party, be hereby declared null and void and of no effect in law,&rdquo; ruled the PPDT. According to the tribunal&rsquo;s chairman, Kyalo Mbobu, members Hassan Abdi and James Atema, the party officials were not properly elected as provided for by the party&rsquo;s constitution.The panel said all the resolutions passed at the said meeting of the National Delegates Convention that purported to elect the officials lacked the requisite quorum. The tribunal declared the resolution passed in the meeting as illegal, null and void. &ldquo;The officials of PNU who were in office as at October 27, 2016, remain the bona fide office bearers of the Party until a proper general meeting is held,&rdquo; Mbobu said. Musyoki lodged a complaint with the PPDT on March 27, saying secretary general John Anunda (pictured) had written a letter dated July 18, 2016, addressed to the National Executive Committee, to discuss urgent matters.He said the invitation of the NEC by Anunda was without the approval of top party officials. The complainant said the meeting took place with only 13 people in attendance, who included strangers.
