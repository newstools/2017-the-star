During the party primaries, male aspirants mobilised supporters to beat up women MP, senator and MCA hopefuls in Kwale county, the women have said.In some instances, men bribed voters or paid people to intimidate women candidates in both Jubilee and ODM party nominations in the area. In some cases, even rivals from other parties helped their male rivals to win, the women said.The women politicians spoke yesterday at Hill Park Hotel, Tiwi, during a Kwale women aspirants and media engagement meeting organised by Sauti ya Wanawake &ndash; Pwani, a programme of Uraia Trust.In Waa Ngombeni, Kibibi Mwaka, the New Democrats Party aspiring MCA, said her opponents from other parties played a role in ensuring she did not make it.&ldquo;I was leading until my opponents came out running, mobilised funds and bribed voters. There was also double voting by locals after my opponents realised I was winning,&rdquo; she said.Voters are ready to elect women, but lack of resources was a major setback as men opponents are well-equipped and funded, Mwaka said.ODM nominated MP Zuleikha Juma, who is running for Kwale woman representative, said her opponents had the backing of a group of powerful and wealthy men in the party, but she struggled to make it.&ldquo;I was not fighting her but the men who were behind her, and I made it after the struggle ... I started campaigning three years ago,&rdquo; she said.Aspiring senator Ginora Kinyasi (ANC), who has stepped down for lack of funds, said that despite mobilising locals to vote, violence in some stations locked them out.Ramisi-Mivumoni MCA hopeful Asha Chimweri (Wiper) said she was almost attacked over claims of supporting another candidate during the ODM nominations.&ldquo;They claimed I was supporting another weaker ODM candidate so that he can win to contest against me, but that wasn&rsquo;t true. It is only that I am a threat to them,&rdquo; she said.Political parties also came out during the discussion with some aspirants saying that the region is still an ODM stronghold, although residents are likely to vote for individuals rather than parties on August 8.While Ginora Kinyasi claimed that Wiper and ODM will still carry the day in Kwale, Party for Development Reforms woman rep candidate Fatuma Tabwara argued that women should support each other to have representation in the national and county assemblies.&ldquo;Let us focus on women candidates to will win and not the issue of parties,&rdquo; she said.Tabwara said most women complaining of mistreatment are either in ODM or Jubilee.Ukunda aspiring MCA Fatuma Chaunga said residents should support women aspirants instead of parties.
