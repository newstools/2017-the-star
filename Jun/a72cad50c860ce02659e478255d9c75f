Governors have raised concerns about the possibility of the IEBC barring 19 county bosses from contesting in the August 8 polls over integrity issues.In a document dated May 31, 2017 to the IEBC vetting committee, the EACC recommended some candidates be barred because they failed the integrity test.Issues raised in the document include misappropriation of public funds, economic crimes, forgery of academic papers, corruption and abuse of office.The document also comprised 87 names of other sitting contestants eyeing Senate, MP and MCA positions.Speaking in Nairobi, Council of Governors chairman, Josphat Nanok, said the IEBC has no mandate to bar any sitting county chief before being found guilty as stated in Chapter Six of the Constitution.&ldquo;To date, no governor has been charged for any offence in a court of law. Hence, there is no constitutional basis for barring anyone who has not been charged, found guilty and exhausted all appeal avenues with the Kenyan judicial system, the council urges the IEBC to adhere to the Constitution,&rdquo; he said.Among those in the EACC list include Garissa Governor Nathif Jama, Isiolo&rsquo;s Godana Doyo, Alfred Mutua (Machakos) and Mwangi Wairia (Murang&rsquo;a), who have pending court cases.Jama has been accused of abuse of office and flouting procurement laws when he authorised the leasing of ambulances at Sh70 million. The case is still in court.Mutua also faces similar charges for the procurement of Subaru cars at Sh47 million. Wairia faces charges of obstructing EACC investigators and destruction of evidence linking him to corruption. Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong is accused of corruptly acquiring property worth more than Sh220 million and benefitting from a Sh91 million street lighting project. Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero has been accused of abuse of office and money laundering. Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga is accused of withdrawing more than Sh8 million from the county coffers to buy air tickets for his family.Kirinyaga governor aspirant and former Devolution CS Anne Waiguru also faces graft charges following the Sh1.8 billion NYS scam.The EACC has written to the IEBC to inform it that the National Assembly Public Accounts Committee recommended she be barred from the August polls. Last week, Waiguru claimed some MPs demanded Sh10 million to clear her in the NYS scandal. During an interview on Citizen TV last Wednesday night, she said, &ldquo;Sometimes, some PAC members would ask for money, so they can write a favourable report.&rdquo;
