The IEBC has started printing ballot papers for the August 8 General Election despite the push and pull over the company awarded the contract.NASA has moved to court seeking cancellation of printing contract given to Dubai firm Al Ghurair and the hearing of the matter is set to begin today.IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati yesterday said the printing is ongoing for elective posts where there are no disputes pending in court.&ldquo;The commission approved the ballot printing for most of the candidates where there are no issues. There are a few cases in court and that percentage is still being worked out because we have received some court orders which we want to enforce so the ones that have no dispute, the printing is ongoing,&rdquo; he said.Chebukati said the IEBC is looking forward to a speedy conclusion of the matter.The gazzetment of candidates participating in the election is ongoing.In areas where there are no pending disputes in court, names of the candidates &ldquo;have been sent to the government printer and should come out anytime from now&rdquo;.He spoke in Nairobi yesterday after guiding 850 IEBC staff through an election preparedness conference.Chebukati said a wide range of issues were discussed during the three-day meeting, including the procurement of strategic and nonstrategic items.&ldquo;As you all know the staff on the ground - presiding officers and clerks - are being recruited.
