At six people died in Mombasa's largest hospital on Tuesday as the nurses strike entered its second day.Health chief officer Dr Khadija Shikely said three patients died in the emergency wing of Coast Provincial General Hospital. Shikely said doctors and a few nurses were attending to accident victims and HIV patients when they died.&ldquo;The other three were critically ill patients admitted at various wards at the hospital. Such patients requires close supervision by nurses who had gone on strike," he told The Star.Shikely said the hospital discharged "able" patients to ease congestion at the hospital that gets thousands of referral cases daily.The most affected areas are the maternity wards and the pediatric wing, which has accident victims.The patients said they were issued with discharge notes and ordered to leave the hospital while others were turned away.The county government has 70 nurses who have been assisting since the strike began.Shikely said they will also hire low service nurses to assist in controlling the situation so as to prevent loss of lives.Nurses at the hospital joined their counterparts in the strike on Monday.Mombasa KNUN secretary Peter Maroko said the situation is expected to get worse from Wednesday as all public hospitals in the county will be affected.Union officials said they will not attend to patients and that the strike is a national issue, not one to do with the county government.&ldquo;The government has failed to honor a CBA with the Kenya National Union of Nurses.We will not resume duty until the CBA is implemented," said Maroko.On Monday, Council of Governors chairman Josephat Nanok (Turkana), said a draft CBA that proposes Sh40.3 billion in the return-to-work formula had already been concluded.He said the national and county governments were in the process of seeking the SRC's approval to ensure the pact conforms to its guidelines before it is signed.&ldquo;We advice that patients find alternatives because we don't want them admitted and not treated," said Maroko.More on this: KNH nurses reject strike as other public hospitals are paralysedAlso read: Nyeri nurses strike, demand promotion and more staff
