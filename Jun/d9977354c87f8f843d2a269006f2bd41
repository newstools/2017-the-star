Sirisia MP John Waluke has said he will run for Bungoma governor in 2022, when “incumbent Kenneth Lusaka completes his second term.” He said on Friday he will sustain Lusaka’s “sterling performance”. Waluke was addressing Bungoma town residents during a JP rally in Posta Grounds. He urged voters to reelect Lusaka to complete the projects he has started, saying he is the best thing that ever happened to the county. ‘’Those with eyes can see that Bungoma has really transformed in the past four years . Roads have been built, schools have been refurbished, youths and women have been empowered and stalled factories have been relaunched.  We want him to continue with that.”
