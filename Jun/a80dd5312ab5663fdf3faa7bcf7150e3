Agriculture CS Willy Bett yesterday warned traders selling a kilo of sugar at more than Sh120 that &ldquo;drastic measures&rdquo; will be taken against them. &ldquo;Millers have reduced the price of a 50kg bag of sugar to Sh5,500, down from Sh8,900, while imported sugar is being sold at beween Sh8,000 and Sh5,200. So consumers should resist prices beyond Sh120. This is very serious because the price was supposed to have come down a week ago,&rsquo;&rsquo; Bett said.He spoke during the opening a ministerial conference on open data.The CS said businessmen who are reaping big from the reduced price should not be selfish, and must pass the benefits to their customers.A two-kilo packet of sugar is retailing at between Sh350 and Sh390, despite adequate supply from the local market and imports.Solomon Odera, the Sugar Directorate interim head, said the cost of importation has gone down from Sh8, 000 to Sh5, 200 for a 50kg bag since early May, while the price of local sugar has decreased from Sh8, 900 to Sh6, 000.&ldquo;From early May, we have witnessed increased supply both from local and external markets. By June, 56,000 metric tonnes of sugar will have been imported to bridge the deficit,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.The national consumption is at 2,000 metric tonnes per day, an equivalent of two million kilos a day.
