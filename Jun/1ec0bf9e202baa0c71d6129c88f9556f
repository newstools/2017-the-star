These are the pillars of development. Without unity and peace, nothing can succeed,&rdquo; he said.Uhuru said Kenya cannot afford to plunge into violence because of the sentiments of some leaders.He told Kenyans to be wary of politicians who incite them to violence or make hate remarks.Ruto said they have gone round the country and spent time in bringing communities together and preaching peace, &ldquo;which has been hard, but through God&rsquo;s will we have prevailed&rdquo;.&ldquo;As we go to the August 8 election, we should be comfortable and relaxed because God is in charge,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m confident and want you to pray so God can frustrate the schemes of some people or anybody who is against our country.&rdquo;Ruto assured that they will do all they can to make sure campaigns and the election are peaceful &ldquo;so the will of God is done&rdquo;.Uhuru lashed ou at Jubilee opponents, especially NASA, for turning election contests into tribe-based competitions, adding that Jubilee is keen to sell its policies to voters.&ldquo;Our opponents think this competition is that of tribes. We want competition based on selling policies, not on threatening some communities or making others to be afraid,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Kiambu people, just as you came out in large numbers and registered as voters, we want [you to come out and vote so that] by 8am in the morning, we should have sent Raila [Odinga] home. By that time, he should be eating ugali in his home and we give him pension.&rdquo;Uhuru accused NASA of lacking issues on which to base its campaigns and said it cannot unite Kenyans.&ldquo;We want to make sure that next year, secondary school education will be free,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Add us another term to finish the roads and railways and give electricity to anyone in need of it. We want to expand hospitals and these are the important things.&rdquo;
