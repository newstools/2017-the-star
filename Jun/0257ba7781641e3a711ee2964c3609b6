Murang&rsquo;a Senator Kembi Gitura has castigated his rival Kiharu MP Irungu Kang&rsquo;ata for leading protests against independent candidates during the President&rsquo;s visit last Wednesday.Kembi said it is unfortunate that leaders seeking elective positions can spearhead unrest over claims independent candidates are not loyal to the President.The legislator, who is also Senate deputy speaker, said he was invited to Uhuru's tour as part of the leadership of the county.&ldquo;I did not invite myself to that tour. I was invited by organisers as the Senator of Murang&rsquo;a, much like every other leader who attended," he said.There were confrontations between a section of Jubilee nominees led by Kang&rsquo;ata and independent candidates after the latter were accused of abandoning the party after losing the primaries.Fierce arguments took place at Blue Post hotel as leaders waited for the President. Nominees said independent candidates had no business attending a party event and asked them to leave.Read: Jubilee supporters, independents cause chaos at Murang'a hotel ahead of Uhuru tourThe Senator noted the tour was not a Jubilee affair but a normal presidential visit that required all local leaders to avail themselves to welcome him.Kembi, who lost to Kang&rsquo;ata during nominations before deciding to vie independently, said many other leaders who were not nominated also attended the function.&ldquo;Several government officers including Cabinet Secretaries and PSs were also in attendance because it was an official government event,&rdquo; he added.The legislator urged the people of Murang&rsquo;a to be very careful about the leaders they elect as those who perpetrate chaos do not deserve to lead.&ldquo;If they wanted me to leave they should just have asked me to leave instead of holding protests,&rdquo; he added.Kembi wondered why Jubilee Party nominees were so disturbed by the presence of independent candidates in the tour yet they were not allowed to address the crowds.He said the people the President went to visit are the people he asks for support during campaigns.&ldquo;Being in the entourage was a political statement for me...that even though I am vying as an independent candidate, what I have been telling people about supporting the President is true,&rdquo; he said.The Senator also noted the need for a leaders' debate in the county to help the people choose the right ones.&ldquo;There is too much propaganda that causes people to vote for wrong leaders."
