President Uhuru Kenyatta on Saturday urged residents of Kakamega county not to fall prey to the antics of the opposition.He asked them to support Jubilee Party for development and progress. Uhuru is seeking a second term in office.The President said the national government has initiated many development projects in the region despite the majority of residents not voting for him in 2013.He said this was proof that his administration cares for the welfare of Kenyans."We implemented development for you even when we knew many people from here did not vote for us.""We assure you that we will do more for you because we are confident that you will vote for us based on our development track record," Uhuru said as he wooed the residents to vote for Jubilee.The President, who was accompanied by Deputy President William Ruto and a host of other leaders, spoke on Saturday as he kicked off Jubilee campaigns in the county.The rallies started at Senator Boni Khalwale&rsquo;s home ground of Malinya in Ikolomani constituency.The President made stops at Khayega, Shinyalu, and Murhanda where he addressed residents.The head of state assured them that his administration will continue making heavy investments in development to uplift their lives.He also warned traders against selling subsidised maize flour at higher prices than the recommended Sh90 per a 2-kg packet."As we work to bridge the maize shortage, I want to warn traders that those who will be found to be hoarding or selling the subsidised maize flour at higher than the recommended government price will be prosecuted."Read: Don't force people to buy unga with other goods, Uhuru tells retailersHighlighting his administration&rsquo;s delivery track record, the President said he is focused on transforming all parts of the country without discrimination.On infrastructure, Uhuru said his administration initiated the construction of over 250 kilometres of tarmac roads in Kakamega county.He said some of the roads are complete while others are at various stages of construction.The President also spoke of health where he said the national government has equipped Kakamega Level 5 and Malava Level 4 with enhanced medical equipment.He said this was under the Managed Equipment Services (MES) at a cost of Sh460 million and Sh380 million respectively."This has ensured that residents can now enjoy specialised healthcare at the grassroots level instead of having to travel long distances to either Kenyatta National Hospital or the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret which were previously the only public health facilities providing the specialized medical care," Uhuru said.He said the provision of free maternity has seen an increase of mothers delivering in public health facilities resulting in a reduction of child and maternal mortality.On electricity, Uhuru said his administration has accelerated connectivity in the county in the four years it has been in office.A total of 76,190 households have been connected to the grid up from just 31,773 households in 2013.Over 800 primary schools in Kakamega county are also currently on the grid, the head of state said.Ruto asked the people of Kakamega to vote for Jubilee &ndash; the winning party &ndash; instead of wasting their votes on the "opposition which has no focus" and does not care for their welfare."Do not gamble with your votes. Let&rsquo;s walk together on this journey so that you join us in forming the government after the August 8 polls," the Deputy President said.Kakamega leaders, including Ikolomani MP Bernard Shinali, said they support Jubilee and will not agree to be used by the opposition again to "further their selfish interests as happened in the past."They said the political terrain in Kakamega and Western Kenya, in general, has shifted in favour of Jubilee and the opposition should stop boasting that the region is their stronghold.
