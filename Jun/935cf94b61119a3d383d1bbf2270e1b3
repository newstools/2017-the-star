We will not be cowed into stepping down in favour of JP candidates, independents have told governor aspirant Mike Sonko.&ldquo;It is not us who want to be on the ballot, it is the people who want us there. Jubilee did not conduct nominations. What we saw cannot be called nominations,&rdquo; Kahawa West MCA Ngaruiya Chege said on Friday.Last Thursday, Sonko gave the independents until Monday to back out or face fierce political war.He said the independents are &ldquo;spoilers and enemies out to deny the party a convincing victory.&rdquo;&ldquo;We will compensate those who will agree to step down. We will even accommodate them in our government because we are sure we are going to win,&rdquo; Sonko said.But County assembly minority whip and Hashim Kamau (California MCA) said there was no justice in the primaries and vowed to soldier on to the end.
