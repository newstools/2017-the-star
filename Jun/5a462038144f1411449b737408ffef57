THAT President Uhuru Kenyatta was well received in parts of Rift Valley is self-evidently encouraging to Jubilee politicians. But some of them are worried by the pockets of NASA supporters who did not hide their preferences when DP William Ruto tried to campaign for some parliamentary candidates. In parts of Kericho, placard-waving NASA supporters shouted opposition slogans to protest against Ruto&rsquo;s attempt to campaign for unpopular candidates.************WHY did NASA take some four days off the campaign trail? This is the question many are asking after Raila Odinga and his team went missing in action from last weekend to Thursday, when they moved to Kajiado. An official of one of the affiliate parties was heard whispering that the NASA machine has been punctured by limited funds. This comes at a time when the NASA top brass fingered President Uhuru Kenyatta and his men allegedly for bankrolling their reelection bid from state coffers. Inside NASA, it's said that Raila, as the Presidential candidate, is funding the lion's share of the massive campaigns. Paying for all the choppers to campaign rallies is said to be part of his wider role.**********LAST week we published a Corridors item that warned of a cartel at the TSC, which was extorting money from unsuspecting teachers. The cartel was calling teachers and asking them for money so they can facilitate their transfer. The TSC has now issued an alert and warned that anyone found asking for money from teachers will be dealt with in accordance with the law.**********IT is interesting that Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko has lived in five-star hotels since he won the Jubilee Party nomination to contest for Nairobi's top seat. Sonko has really worked on his image, with some reports alleging that he hired a consultant to look executive. A JP insider close to State House operatives said he was forced to stay at the hotels to contain his drama. Corridors is wondering if his handlers, who have managed to change his image, will still do the same if he wins the August polls since he cannot stay in high-end hotels forever. There were allegations that his team was chased away at the first hotel they used within the CBD after they failed to adhere to 'five-star behaviour'.
