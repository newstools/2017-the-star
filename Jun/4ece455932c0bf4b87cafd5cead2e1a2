Eight people have been killed by mob in Mombasa in June only, the civil society has said.Haki Africa and the Law Society of Kenya, Mombasa Chapter, said members of the public have resorted to taking law into their hands.Haki Africa coordinator Francis Auma said the numbers are worrying.Auma said the killings mostly involves youths aged between 13 and 19 years.He said there have been areas where zero tolerance of youths suspected to be criminals has been experienced.According to Haki Africa, Kibokoni, Old Town and other parts of Mvita constituencies have led in mob killings.The other areas are Likoni, Jomvu and Kisauni.&ldquo;If more killings continue, cases of revenge by the gangs and the public are going to be the order of the day,&rdquo; Auma said.Mombasa LSK chairman Benjamin Njoroge said the public is now closely following the footsteps of the police by not following the rule of law.&ldquo;The public should give the justice system a chance and let the courts decide. If this trend continues, we are going to lose many innocent people,&rdquo; he said.Sentiments were echoed few days after an alleged notorious gangster Mohammud Shekune, alias Bobocha, was killed by a mob in Old Town.Security agencies said the slain gangster had been evading police.Irate members of the public beat up the suspected gangster after he stabbed a resident and robbed him of his valuables.In May, police released 24 names and photographs of knife-wielding juvenile criminal gang members.The lot was blamed for increasing cases of crime in Mombasa's Old Town.
