The Nyeri government is training farmers on pest control after the destructive Fall Armyworm was detected in Nyeri South, Tetu and Nyeri Central subcounties. Agriculture executive Robert u said, &ldquo;County farmers are being sensitised on pest identification, monitoring and scouting of the pest and on pest control using the appropriate pesticides.&rdquo; Farmers are being encouraged to diversify by planting traditional highvalue crops such as sweet potatoes and arrowroots. The county has also asked the state to help contain the pest. In Kenya, the pest was first detected in Trans Nzoia in March. It later spread to the Rift Valley, Western and Nyanza. &ldquo;The pest is spreading rapidly and has the potential to cause 100 per cent loss in a wide range of crops ... thus a threat to food security and loss of income to farmers,&rdquo; Thuo said.
