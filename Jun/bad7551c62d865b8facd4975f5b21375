Nairobi governor aspirant Peter Kenneth&rsquo;s campaigns have suffered a major blow after some of his supporters defected to Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko's camp. Several youths led by Kenneth's Youth and Operations co-coordinator Jackson Aluda, popularly known as Sammy Boy, wrote to Peter Kenneth telling him they had quit his camp.In the letter seen by the Star, the youths said they quit his camp as they want to secure the Jubilee agenda in Nairobi."I hereby wish to tender my resignation as the Youth and Operations co-coordinator at Peter Kenneth Secretariat," the letter states."My decision results from the fact that a few weeks to Jubilee party primaries all contenders for the race to oust the incumbent had a gentleman&rsquo;s agreement to support whoever wins the ticket. This was for the sake of party unity."
