Nairobi county health officers yesterday failed to release results of an investigation into an incident in which 50 people last week contracted cholera at Weston Hotel.Instead, it formed a task force to look at the matter further and present its report in 14 days.The county confirmed that tests from the National Public Health Laboratory showed that six out of 24 samples taken from 50 patients, who were admitted to hospitals in the city, returned positive results for cholera.On Sunday, Governor Evans Kidero directed the county Health department to investigate the matter and audit all the members of staff at the hotel and give a report in two days.But Health executive Bernard Muia yesterday said it was practically impossible to investigate the incident in two days, &ldquo;as the exercise required collaboration of all stakeholders&rdquo;.&ldquo;In health, investigations are usually evidence-based. They are scientific and do not rely on hearsay,&rdquo; he said.Muia said a 15-member task force comprising the county health officials, Ministry of Health, Doctors Without Boarders, Amref, the Kenya Red Cross and the Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company has been put in place to probe the circumstances that led to the outbreak at the hotel.&ldquo;The team met today [yesterday] and designed terms of engagement,&rdquo; he said at City Hall.Muia said the county has improved disease surveillance and health promotion campaigns to detect new cholera cases and create awareness to avoid spread.City Hall has activated four cholera treatment units to admit new cases that may be reported.Meanwhile, Muia has ordered the closure of all eateries and hotels operating without food licences and valid food handlers&rsquo; certificates.In May, three people died of cholera after attending a wedding in Karen.The executive, however, allayed fears that city residents are at risk of contacting the disease, saying the county has put in place adequate measures &mdash; including stocking of drugs &mdash; to respond to any reported case.
