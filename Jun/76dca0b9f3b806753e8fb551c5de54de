More than 200 IDPs who were displaced after the 1997 ethnic violence in Njoro, Nakuru County have accused the government of neglect.Their chair Clement Kitolel asked President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto to resettle them before the August 8 general election.At Nyayo Stadium in Nakuru on Tuesday, the IDPs told journalists that title deeds issued to them by retired President Daniel Moi were revoked.They said the titles for the Likia Mauche land were revoked during President Mwai Kibaki's term. Kibaki ran the government from 2003 to 2013.The group is among victims of clashes who were resettled in Baraget settlement scheme in Kuresoi South.Kitolel said they were once allocated pieces of land bought by the government from Njenga Karume's family in Molo."But the matter was politicised and the plan was dropped. We have sought a solution to this problem in vain," he said."We have gone to relevant government offices including the county commissioner and regional coordinator's."The displaced persons asked Uhuru to "rescue them from perennial false promises from politicians"."We have been victims of false promises from politicians who pledge to resettle us every time an election is imminent." They also asked why the government has resettled other IDPs countrywide but ignored them."Are they ignoring us because we are not in opposition or what?" posed Kitolel.
