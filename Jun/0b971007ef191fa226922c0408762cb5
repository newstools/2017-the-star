ODM Sirisia MP candidate Moses Nandalwe has accused unnamed Jubilee politicians in Bungoma county of threatening to kill him. He said the politicians have been “lying to the President he has hope of getting many votes in Bungoma”. Nandalwe said in a statement yesterday, “Some politicians have made public utterances meant to make me look bad so they can take a slice of the Bungoma vote to Jubilee.” He said on Tuesday at 5.40pm, a group of politicians, whom he has reported to the police, threatened to kill him at the Hotel Intercontinental. The case was reported at the Central police station under OB140/30/5/2017. The aspirant said his opponents have continuously accused him of being behind the cold reception Deputy President William Ruto received in Misikhu during his tour of Bungoma last month. “If the people of Misikhu are opposed to the regime like other regions, why should my opponent drag my name into his broker deals?” Nandalwe said. Nandalwe has said he will not be intimidated and exuded confidence he will win. Police in Webuye lobbed teargas canisters to disperse more than 50 youths allied to NASA as they attempted to prevent Ruto from passing.
