NASA has dismissed the KPMG voters audit report and warned IEBC is frustrating electoral reforms to manipulate August polls for status quo to be maintained.In a statement on Tuesday, the Opposition coalition said KPMG failed to declare documents used to do the "shoddy workwhich would have been done by IEBC clerks".&ldquo;More worrisome is that it is not clear which was the source register - abiometric or green book - since IEBC has been operating with parallel registers whose accuracy is suspect,&rdquo; NASA campaign chairman and ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi said.&ldquo;Friday&rsquo;s KPMG report on their alleged audit of the national voter register is, to say the least, shoddy work, and therefore a major betrayal of the people of Kenya."The other principals are flag bearer Raila Odinga (ODM), DP candidate Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper), Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto (Cha Cha Mashinani) and Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula (Ford Kenya).The firm said an estimated additional 1,037,260 dead voters could be on the roll. It also recommended the removal of over 92,277 dead voters from the IEBC register.More on this: Over one million dead voters could be in IEBC register, KPMG says in audit reportBut NASA listed several shortcomings, which it termed evident, and called upon IEBC to "immediately publish the list of the dead voters, those of double and multiple registrations and those of other inconsistencies for Kenyans to verify on their own".Mudavadi further said the firm used desk reviews and cross checking of data against incomplete national databases of births and deaths as provided by a "wanting" National Registration Bureau.NASA warned the appointment of KPMG was part of a wider scheme by IEBC top brass wider to frustrate electoral reforms and push for Jubilee's interests.They said the agency exploited loopholes in the procurement process, among them single-sourcing to suppliers, to engage in corrupt activities as well as bring on board companies that can be compromised to rig the poll.&ldquo;The problem lies with IEBC scheming to deliberately drag and distort procurement processes in order to single-source suppliers citing tight timelines,&rdquo; said Mudavadi. &ldquo;The country that hoped for a modicum of electoral reforms for a credible election has been crudely shortchanged in a queermanoeuvreby the leadership of the IEBC who appear compelled to push fishy Jubilee agenda all the time. &ldquo;Just like the audit has turned into an electoral fraud on Kenyans, there are all pointers that the KIEMS kitty is a disaster set to erupt on election day and the Dubai-printed ballot papers could betailor-madeto undermine free and fair elections on August 8.&rdquo;NASA flag bearer Raila Odinga earlier accused top Jubilee leaders of having a hand in the award of a ballot papers tender to Al Ghurair Printing.Al Ghurair is to print about 120 million ballot papers, election results forms and poll registers.Raila said on Tuesday that information they have indicates the firm has had contracts with senior Jubilee officials for at least three years.Read more: Jubilee leaders pushed for Al Ghurair printing tender, Raila claims in polls warningThe Opposition further said IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati and CEO EzraChilobashared ideologies with "Jubilee hawks" Aden Duale, Kithure Kindiki, Kipchumba Murkomen and Johnson Sakaja to push for a jubilee party agenda.Duale is National Assembly majority leader while Kindiki is Senate majority leader and Tharaka Nithi legislator, Murkomen is Elgeyo Marakwet Senator and Sakaja Jubilee's Nairobi Senator aspirant. NASA said KPMG findings, which are out in the open, show the company should have done a better job and that the IEBC needs to cross-check the report with NRB data."One wonders what KPMG was being paid for if it couldn&rsquo;tfulfillthe contract to audit the register,&rdquo; said the Amani National Congress leader.Mudavadi said the auditing process was opaque and included the minimal participation of key non-state stakeholders.The Opposition warned the exercise did not capture the experiences and input of the general public and that further tampering by IEBC is likely to disenfranchise parts of the population.&ldquo;Dark clouds are fast building over this historic general election,&rdquo; said Mudavadi.NASA principals said the high number of inconsistencies and dead voters in the register is a serious matter that requires the validation of all stakeholders to guarantee free, fair and credible elections.
