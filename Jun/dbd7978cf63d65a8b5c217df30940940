Jubilee Nairobi governor aspirant Mike Sonko is a decoy candidate Deputy President William Ruto is using to gain access to and control of City Hall to swindle the county, Governor Evans Kidero has claimed.Kidero warned residents against electing Sonko, claiming his opponent &ldquo;is not himself&rdquo; in the race for the city&rsquo;s top job, but a proxy and a project of the Deputy President.&ldquo;It appears the team that is running against us is not able to talk to Nairobians unless they are in the presence of the President or Deputy President,&rdquo; he said.Kidero continued, &ldquo;The Deputy President wants to represent the people of Nairobi through proxies. But we want to tell him that Nairobians want their own governor who they choose.&rdquo;He said Ruto&rsquo;s increasing interest in the political affairs of the capital and &ldquo;his trying to dictate to the residents who to elect is a clear indication he had a hand in the manipulation of Jubilee nominations in favour of Sonko.&ldquo;We know Ruto. He cannot be the Deputy President, and at the same time be the governor of Nairobi, Bomet, Uasin Gishu, Nakuru, Kiambu and Kericho,&rdquo; he said.Kidero continued, &ldquo;This is actually confirming what people are saying: That he is weeding out strong people before 2022. But who tells him he will be President? Only God knows. Raila [Odinga] will win in 2017 and in 2022 Kalonzo [Musyoka] will take over.&rdquo;His remarks come just a week after independent candidate Peter Kenneth, who lost to Sonko in the JP primaries, claimed Ruto was the mastermind behind his loss.&ldquo;We did not lose the Jubilee nominations because my opponent was assisted by somebody high up in the party hierarchy,&rdquo; he said in Mlango Kubwa on Tuesday.Kenneth continued, &ldquo;Our opponent was assisted by somebody who wanted to cut me to size politically.&rdquo;
