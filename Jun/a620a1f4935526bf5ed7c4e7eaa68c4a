On Friday, Sauti Sol&rsquo;s Bien Aime Baraza posted several videos of himself and his girlfriend Chiki Onwukwe on Instagram to show the world that they are still together.The videos were littered with expletives and showcased Bien shirtless, dancing provocatively as Chiki, who is holding the camera phone, eggs him on. The lead vocalist of the popular award-winning group reacted angrily to news of his &ldquo;breakup&rdquo; with his longtime girlfriend.We sought to get a comment from his girlfriend Chiki and on introducing ourselves, a livid Bien snatched the phone from her retorting, &ldquo;We are okay. We are chill. Don&rsquo;t call my wife again asking her stupid questions!&rdquo; Bien shouted then hang up.We then called Bien, who was still riled up by the rumours. He picked and said, &ldquo;Play my new music. Stop calling me about stupid things.&rdquo;Bien added: &ldquo;Niko na dem yangu hapa tunakula breakfast masimu zinaingia kwa nyumba yetu mpaka tunashindwa tufanye nini... Na tuko tu sawa muache kututafuta manze.&rdquo;
