Bad blood between police and lawyers &mdash; due to the murder of lawyer Willie Kimani &mdash; has impeded justice and undermined the rule of law, the LSK said on Friday.Law Society of Kenya president Isaac Okero said the relationship has been strained since the brutal murder of human rights lawyer Kimani, his client and taxi driver in June last year.They were abducted after leaving a court where Kimani represented his client against an AP officer accused of brutality.They went missing on June 23 and their bodies were found on July 1.Okero said the torture murders of Kimani, client Josephat Mwenda and driver Joseph Muiruri crippled the efforts by LSK members in discharging their duties.&ldquo;This situation is bad for the administration of justice and shall undermine the rule of law as both advocates and police cannot function in an atmosphere of acrimony,&rdquo; Okero said.He spoke at the Consolata Shine, Nairobi, during a memorial service for the three.Okero reaffirmed the LSK&rsquo;s demand for firm and decisive action against extrajudicial killings.He said they are at the forefront in demanding the professional and personal rights and freedom of lawyers be protected, defended and respected. &ldquo;Five police officers are standing trial for the murder and LSK is participating in this trial to ensure justice is done,&rdquo; Okero said.He condemned the recent murder of the Mumias Sugar Company secretary and legal manager by armed gunmen, saying their members have continued to die in line of duty.Okero said, &ldquo;Witness reports are that two of the perpetrators were wearing police uniforms. This must be stopped.&rdquo;Africa International Justice Mission vice president Claire Wilkinson blamed politicians for failing to eradicate extrajudicial killings and urged Kenyans to continue pushing for justice.
