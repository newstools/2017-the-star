Kenyan female rapper Xtatic is moving to greater heights after going missing from the music industry for a while now after she cut links with music giant, Sony Music. She has now been signed to a US-based record label called Silopanna Records. Taking to social media, Xtatic posted a video of the CEO of Unruly Records, Shawn Caesar, welcoming her to the family, revealing how happy they are to have her and the big things they are about to do with her in terms of her music. In the midst of being super-excited and her fans sending in their congratulatory message, one fan commented: "I hope they got clout in the game, can't find them anywhere...Facebook page was created 4 hours ago." Xtatic went ahead to reveal she trusts this new label, having been signed a while back to a really big record label that didn't give her what she expected and what other people expected from her as an artiste. She said: "Well, it's more about why I'm trusting them to do the work. I've worked with one of the biggest labels but in comparison to the expectation, I didn't get to get so much that I and everybody else expected. So now, I'm trusting people who are willing to work for me and also have my best interests at heart, if there is anything I've learnt it's that a name or how big or small may not equate to success, it's the work they put in that should speak for itself. So let's wait and see on this new venture that I'm really excited about."
