Some services have been suspended at Thika Level 5 Hospital as the thin staff struggles to serve patients as the nurses&rsquo; strike enters the ninth day. Deputy medical superintendent Dr Joseph Waiganjo said they are handling the situation the best way they could. Only doctors, a handful of nurses and student doctors are around. &ldquo;Yes, as a staff we are doing all that is possible to ensure that we do not turn away any patient who needs our services. However, we are unable to run some emergency services as some of them cannot run without nurses,&rdquo; Waiganjo said. &ldquo;We are also unable to admit any new patient into our wards due to the limited workforce but those who are already admitted are being well taken care of.&rdquo; The casualty department is nonfunctional and all its beds had been taken outside for repairs and cleaning. There was not a single patient being handled in this department. Patients expressed frustration with the slow services. &ldquo;It is now more than an hour since I was rushed here after being hit by a car near Kiganjo Estate as I was going home on a boda boda. I am in pain but no one seems to be bothered to look at my leg,&rdquo; Jennifer Muthoni said.
