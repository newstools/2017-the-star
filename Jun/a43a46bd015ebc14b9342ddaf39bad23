Government spokesperson Eric Kiraithe has dismissed claims by Raila Odinga that the maize shortage is man-made.Raila on Wednesday called for the sacking of top government officials over the crisis which has led to the unavailability of flour and high prices.He called for the sacking of CSs Mwangi Kiunjuri (Devolution), Willy Bett (Agriculture) and Agriculture PS Richard Lesiyampe."It is a famine created and driven by a regime of incompetence, corruption and bad politics."Read:&nbsp;Sack Bett and Kiunjuri over 'man-made unga crisis', Raila tells Uhuru But Kiraithe defended the government against the claims that it is frustrating millers who want to import maize.In February, he said, the government sent a delegation to Ethiopia, which led to the importation of 13,000 metric tonnes of maize, each bag going for between Sh4,000 and Sh5,000."The government then subsidised this with Sh1,000 so as to make the maize more affordable to the public," Kiraithe said on Thursday."Ethiopia has always been willing and will continue to work with millers who want to import more maize."The spokesman said the government is working to ensure it sustains the sale of subsidised flour at Sh90 until August."The only condition Kenya gave millers is that one must have maize fit for human consumption that retails at Sh90 per (2kg) packet. If you meet the above requirement, the relevant government departments will facilitate you on priority basis.""Raila is a suave businessman and he can exploit this opportunity," the government spokesperson added.The government introduced subsidised maize flour in mid-May after prices shot up due to shortage of maize.Many Kenyans, however, say they are yet to receive the flour, while others have complained that they are limited to purchasing two packets in most outlets.Others have said the subsidised costs between Sh120 and Sh150.More on this: Worry about prices of Unga and milk not defeating Raila, KOT tell Uhuru
