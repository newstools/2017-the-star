Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho will stop Waitiki land squatters from paying the Sh182,000 to get title deeds for the land they occupy, should NASA take over government after the August 8 election, he has said.Any money paid for the title deeds will be refunded, Joho said, as he looks to endear himself to the people of Likoni, whose MP Masoud Mwahima ditched ODM for Jubilee.Political observers say there is a danger of Likoni giving Jubilee unprecedented votes due to Mwahima&rsquo;s popularity and influence and that is what Joho and his ODM brigade are fighting.Joho&rsquo;s ally Mishi Mboko, the Mombasa woman representative, is eyeing the Likoni MP seat.Squatters on the 930-acre controversial Waitiki Farm in Likoni were forced to buy the land they occupy, with President Uhuru Kenyatta saying the government will not buy off the land and let the squatters live there for free.No free landThe 11,000 were to pay the amount in three years, from January 2016, for them to get the title deeds, which would have raised about Sh2 billion.In January last year, Evanson Waitiki, who owned the farm before surrendering it to the government on November 18, 2015, said the land was worth Sh9 billion then.The Mombasa government offered to buy off the land but the national government trashed their plan.Joho on Monday said he will be a very important person in the national government should NASA win and will take good care of his people.&ldquo;I will reverse all the bad they [Jubilee administration] have done through a Raila-led government. In Waitiki, I will tell them not to pay from that day. Those who have paid will have their money refunded,&rdquo; he said.Joho spoke during the annual Eid Baraza in Treasury Square on Monday.He said port services will remain in Mombasa and in case of expansion, it will be within the Coast region first, including ports and dry ports in Mariakani, Voi, Mazeras, Shimoni, Kilifi and other areas.&ldquo;You people say I speak too much. I speak because it is the truth,&rdquo; Joho said.He said leaders begged President Uhuru not to sell the land to the squatters, but he refused because Likoni did not vote for him in 2013.State unfair to Mombasa&ldquo;I was waiting to see if that was a new government policy. Was it going to happen in other regions? But until today, in the history of this country, the only place where squatters were forced to buy their own land is Mombasa county. Then you ask why I criticise Uhuru. How?&rdquo; the governor said.He said in Kiambu county, squatters were given land free of charge and the allotment fees were waived.Joho cited coffee farmers in Central whose debts have been cancelled and their title deeds, which they used as security, returned to them.In an apparent attack on Jubilee Mombasa governor candidate Suleiman Shahbal, Joho said some other leaders in Mombasa oppose their plans to improve the lives of residents because of politics and to make their bosses happy.He said they oppose plans to create a dry port in Naivasha as it will transfer port services from Mombasa, but some government defenders say the dry port is part of a national expansion programme.&ldquo;A national programme that serves who? I look after my Mombasa people first then others will follow. Because I am a leader here in Mombasa,&rdquo; Joho said.&ldquo;That is why I ask you people of Mombasa to vote for leaders who will stand together to fight for your rights.&rdquo;
