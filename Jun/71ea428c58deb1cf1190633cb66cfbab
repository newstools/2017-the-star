Mike Sonko and Peter Kenneth yesterday skipped the Nairobi governor aspirants&rsquo; debate convened by the Kenya Alliance of Residents&rsquo; Association at Crowne Plaza Hotel. Sonko is running for the city&rsquo;s top job on a Jubilee Party ticket. He and Kenneth (independent) are among seven candidates vying for the seat and were invited by the organisers to the debate. Kara chief executive Henry Ochieng said Sonko had confirmed he would attend, &ldquo;but we were surprised to see his deputy this morning.&rdquo;About Kenneth, Ochieng said, &ldquo;He had not confirmed but sent an e-mail today [yesterday] when the debate was going on saying he had other engagements.&rdquo; The debate focused on matters affecting city residents, with each candidate accusing incumbent Governor Evans Kidero of running down the city. Kidero instead blamed the traffic jam on the increased number of vehicles.
