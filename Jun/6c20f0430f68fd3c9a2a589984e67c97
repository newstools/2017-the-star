Uhuru na Ruto wameleta hii njaa makusudi ili waweze kufaidika na kufanya biashara na wananchi."(This food crisis has been created by Uhuru and Ruto intentionally because they want to benefit from the proceeds by manipulating Kenyans)Raila said the Sh90 unga is not available to ordinary Kenyans adding that it is painstaking that the duo are out to make citizens suffer in hunger."The unga is only available in the eyes of Uhuru and Ruto. It is not accessible to ordinary Kenyans," Raila said.He urged residents to vote out Jubilee saying it has failed to fulfill its campaign pledges.Raila cited the laptops for schools, subsidised fertiliser, lowering cost of living, creation of jobs, and 10,000-km roads as some of the unfulfilled pledges."NASA is the only hope for Kenyans now in the face of these failures. Let us vote out Jubilee."Read: We can't allow five more years of Jubilee's theft, fatal economic flaws - Raila
