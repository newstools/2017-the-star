Directors of Platinum Distillers will face prosecution for allegedly stealing keg barrels from their rival East Africa Breweries Limited.In a ruling on the dispute, Justice John Mativo said the Inspector General of Police and the DPP are at liberty to arrest, charge and prosecute the lot.The judge said IG Joseph Boinnet and Director of Public Prosecution Keriako Tobiko can go ahead and pursue the matter.This followed a case where Platinum Distillers moved to court to challenge their prosecution for counterfeiting EABL keg barrels."I find nothing in the material before me to show that the petitioners right to a fair trial has been hampered or threatened in the criminal trial in question," Justice Mativo ruled.The judge also said there was no tangible evidence to demonstrate that the police acted maliciously or outside their powers or that the prosecution in question was commenced without proper or reasonable foundation.The brewer is being accused of stealing EABL barrels and converting them into its own.The firm that manufactures, packs and distributes alcoholic drinks in the country had moved to court claiming that the DPP, Anti-counterfeit Authority, the police, and its rival EABL had colluded to harass its staff and distributors.Platinum had told the court that claims that it had counterfeited the 50 liters keg barrel was malicious as its cylinders are uniquely branded and engraved.Its argument was that the barrels are clearly distinguishable.Moreover, the firm argued that the patents in question have not even been patented by another company and that its beer is licensed by the Kenya Bureau of Standards.The keg barrel dispute between the two companies arose on or about December last year.This was when police officers, the Anti-Counterfeit Agency and EABL went to the brewer's premises situated along the Eastern Bypass.The investigators were tipped off by a member of the public who told them that the company was using counterfeit barrels.In December 2016, ACA and CID officers searched the firm's factory at Ruai and impounded 12 empty EABL barrels.Twenty fraudulently converted EABL barrels and two upper keg rings with the words "Platinum Distillers Ltd were also seized.The barrels recovered from the distiller were taken to manufacturer of EABL's barrels in Spain.They were analysed and identified to be those of EABL leading to the arrest of the firm's officials.While opposing the suit by Platinum, the DPP stated that the arrest, charging and seizure of the company&rsquo;s officers were done lawfully.The DPP said that the present case was aimed at curtailing his powers."The police only need to establish reasonable suspicion before preferring charges. The rest is left to the trial court.""As long as the prosecution and those charged with the responsibility of making the decisions to charge act in a reasonable manner, the High Court would be reluctant to intervene," the judge observed.Agreeing with the DPP, Justice Mativo said he found nothing in the petition to suggest, even in the slightest that their prosecution was mounted without legal basis.The judge observed that the firm did not explain how it acquired the barrels nor did it prove that seizure of the barrels infringed on their constitutional rights."I find nothing in the material before me to suggest that the DPP acted in violation of the constitution."The judge also held that there were no constitutional issues raised nor any violation of rights had been proved as alleged."I find that this petition has no merits. Consequently, I dismiss this petition with costs to the respondents," Mativo said in the June 21 ruling.
