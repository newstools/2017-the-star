Labour ministry officials did not turn up for talks to resolve the nurses' stand-off with the government, further stalling the mediation.Cotu acting secretary general Benson Okwaro said Labour CS Phyllis Kandie was out of the country. However, Cotu is planning to meet the ministry, Council of Governors and nurses' union representatives at a later date.On Tuesday, Cotu met Kenya National Union of Nurses officials and the unionists stood their ground that they would not renegotiate the collective bargaining agreement. They want it signed and deposited in court as it is.Nurses countrywide have been on strike since June 5 over a pay dispute and they also want their CBA implemented.&ldquo;We had a meeting with the nurses&rsquo; union leaders and they are very clear that they will not allow renegotiation in the existing CBA and we support it since the negotiations were held between the union and the nurses&rsquo; employer and agreed upon,&rdquo; Okwaro told the Star on Tuesday.The CoG has already said it cannot honour the Sh40 billion CBA because it is too expensive.CoG chairman Josphat Nanok said counties do not even have money to pay for the allowances awarded to nurses in December and doctors in March.He said the counties and the Commission for Revenue Allocation proposed an allocation of Sh314 billion to the counties in the Division of Revenue Bill, 2017.However, the National Assembly has slashed that to Sh291 billion.&ldquo;The CRA and CoG proposals, which the National Assembly disregarded, include allocations on the negotiated allowances for doctors, nurses, clinical officers and other health professions amounting to Sh12.3 billion. Furthermore, this has not factored in the ongoing CBA negotiations for nurses,&rdquo; Nanok said in a statement.He said promotions and increased allowances for other staff will also be put on hold because there is no money.&ldquo;The National Assembly figures do not factor in the job reevaluation exercise done by the Salaries and Remuneration Commission, which has financial implications on the county governments,&rdquo; the statement says.Parliament has still not passed the Division of Revenue Bill, which the counties require to draw their 2017-18 budgets.This also means the County Revenue Allocation Bill, 2017, cannot be debated and passed.&ldquo;Without a County Revenue Allocation Act, 2017, the county governments cannot develop their budgets for the 2017-18 financial year,&rdquo; Nanok said. At least 20 people have been reported dead in hospitals since the strike began.KNUN deputy secretary general Maurice Opetu said nurses have been receiving sack threats over the strike.&ldquo;Our members are being intimidated and threatened. But we have told members to stay put. The strike is still on until the CBA is signed and deposited in court. They should not listen to anyone else apart from the union,&rdquo; he told the Star.
