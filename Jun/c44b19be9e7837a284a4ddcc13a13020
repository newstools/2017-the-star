At least 10 doctors who contracted cholera at Weston Hotel last week have been discharged from Nairobi Hospital.They left hospital on Saturday and yesterday and will recuperate at home, but two patients who were undergoing dialysis are still hospitalised.The Star also established that 18 of 25 culture tests returned positive results for cholera.The culture method is the most recommended test for diagnosis of cholera because it isolates and grows vibrio cholerae bacteria.Doctors said Weston Hotel, where the infection is suspected to have originated, should have been closed to manage the outbreak.&ldquo;There is a national guideline on cholera management. Weston should have been quarantined. Otherwise infections might continue and some people might go home and expose their families to infection,&rdquo; said Dr Simon Kigondu, who has managed a similar outbreak in Isiolo.However, Weston Hotel general manager Michael Nzile told journalists that they had followed Ministry of Health procedures.Kenya Medical Association national secretary Dr Lukoye Atwoli faulted the Ministry of Health for continuing to deny the outbreak.He said there was only a &ldquo;very low&rdquo; likelihood the majority of the screening tests would be falsely positive.&ldquo;We take great exception to the statements attributed to high level officials in the Ministry of Health, allegedly exonerating the hotel that was the clear nexus of this infection, and instead blaming the victims for bringing this affliction upon themselves,&rdquo; he said.No deaths have been reported.Director of Medical Services Dr Jackson Kioko said he would make a statement after receiving a complete report from the National Public Health Laboratories where the culture tests were conducted. Stool samples from a patient are usually set in a medium that isolates the bacteria from the diarrhea. On incubation, vibrio cholerae appear as yellow clumps which are then analyzed to detect the exact strain. This definitive diagnosis allows cholera to be distinguished from other causes of dysentery. The cholera victims were attending a lung conference organised by the ministry at Weston Hotel, which is associated with Deputy President William Ruto. They experienced diarrhoea and vomiting starting on Tuesday. Officials of the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union accused the government of a coverup.
