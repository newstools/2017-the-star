A 25-year-old house help has pleaded guilty to attempting to kill her employer&rsquo;s son by poisoning him in Embakasi.Jacinta Muia is charged with attempted murder. She is accused of trying to cause the death of a child aged nine years on June 8 at Kariobangi South.Muia admitted to abducting the boy on the same dates to murder him.The court heard she falsely presented herself as Batula Sharif to Safaricom agents with a fake ID card.The prosecution told the court that Muia was employed by the child&rsquo;s parents and had been living with them. State counsel Angela Fuchaka said Muia and her employer had a quarrel regarding her husband and she left their home to go and stay with her pastor.While there, Muia planned to kidnap the child from school and went with him to her boyfriend&rsquo;s home, where she bought a soft drink and pesticide, mixed them and gave the child to drink. The child took the drink, but with difficulty.Muia then took him and headed to the Huruma stage to board a matatu. She alighted and ordered the conductor to take the child to Moi Airbase stage, where she alleged the mother was waiting. The conductor talked to the child who gave him his father&rsquo;s number. The father was called and the matter reported to the police, leading to Muia&rsquo;s arrest at the pastor&rsquo;s house.In her mitigation, Muia told the court she is remorseful and was only after revenge.&ldquo;I am sorry for the offence, but the boy&rsquo;s father assaulted me while I was working there. When I tried to raise the matter with his wife I was chased away, and I planned the revenge,&rdquo; she said.Chief magistrate Heston Nyaga gave Muia time to think about her guilty plea.&ldquo;If she still pleads guilty I will give my sentence,&rdquo; Nyaga said.Muia was remanded last Monday after police asked for more days to complete investigation but she told the police she had a confession to make.The case will be mentioned on June 28.
