More than 100 integrated internally displaced persons in Kiambu county have threatened to obtain a court order to block IDPs&rsquo; compensation over an &ldquo;erroneous&rdquo; list.They want the Devolution ministry to investigate why their names are missing in the list given to the Kiambu county commissioner and Limuru deputy county commissioner&rsquo;s offices.Representative Mbugua Njenga yesterday said they fear that unintended beneficiaries will be paid.&ldquo;Many of our people&rsquo;s names are missing. Others are finding their names, but their ID card numbers have errors,&rdquo; Njenga said.However, a government official, who asked not to be named, said the state relied on the IDPs&rsquo; list it wrote in Kirathimo IDP camp in 2008 after the post-election violence.The official said the IDPs formed several groups, each with officials and with additional names, but those were cancelled as the original list had the real IDPs.
