Kenya&rsquo;s Kenneth Keter and Ethiopia&rsquo;s Worknesh Degefa will start as favourites at the Mattoni Olomouc Half Marathon.Keter, 20, set his 59:48 career in 2016, and on Saturday will be targeting his first win over the distance this year after three performances in the 1:01:05 to 1:01:50 range in the first half of 2017.Meanwhile, 23-year-old Kenyan Simon Cheprot, with a 59:20 lifetime best from 2013 to his credit, will start as the fastest in the field. He has dipped under the 60-minute barrier on two other occasions&mdash;59:32 and 59:39&mdash;but both of those came in 2015. He&rsquo;ll bring a more modest season&rsquo;s best of 1:02:10 to the line of this eastern Czech city on Saturday. Veteran Felix Kandie could also be a factor as well. With two sub-2:06 marathons under his belt, the 30-year-old has stronger credentials over the longer distance, but a 1:00:04 half marathon best set last year shows he can be expected in the mix. Notable too is that his 2:06:03 personal best in the marathon was set in March, illustrating that he&rsquo;s in the shape of his life.Also among the strong Kenyan contingent are Peter Some, with 1:00:21 and 2:05:38 (both from 2013) personal bests, and Josphat Kiptis, who won this race in 2015 in 1:00:21, still the 23-year-old&rsquo;s career best. Also expected in the mix is rising British star Callum Hawkins, who&rsquo;s twice come close to breaking 60 minutes this year. In February, he clocked 1:00:00 to win in Marugame, Japan, and followed up with a 1:00:08 run in New York in March, finishing second.Degefa leads strong trioIn the women&rsquo;s contest, Degefa leads a strong top-end trio. The Ethiopian won January&rsquo;s Dubai Marathon with a 2:22:36 personal best, and more recently finished third in the Istanbul Half Marathon in 1:08:55 and second over 10km in Bengaluru in 32:00. The 26-year-old is well known to Czech fans, having won the Prague half in 2015 and finishing second there last year with a 1:06:14 lifetime best.
