Chemelil Sugar&rsquo;s center half Victor Majid is expected to pen a two year contract with AFC Leopards after successful negotiations. The acquisition of the former KCB and Bandari defender, who also has a number of national caps, will bolsterAFC defence which leaked in a number of goals in the first leg, leaving the 12-time champions in unusual position on the standings.Majid, 24, who also plied his trade with Sony Sugar and Karuturi Sports is expected to partner with ex-Mathare centre-half Robinson Kamura in marshalling the defence. Majid, who also plays as an holding midfielder, will be a quality addition in the squad ahead of the second leg. With Leopards stretching their win-less run to eight-match&mdash; a result which has seen them sit 12th in the standings with 14 points&mdash;the addition of Majid will inject the necessary pace both in the defence and the midfield. This will give the tactician the required depth and options for the remaining part of the season.Confirming the signing, Leopards&rsquo; chairman Dan Mule said: &ldquo;We are not yet done with recruitment. We want to have a very strong team by the end of this month so we are still negotiating with different players here in Kenya and abroad. We shall let you know when we have finalised everything. We have been in touch with him (Majid) for one month now, and there are very few things pending between us and his club. We will sign his contract before the end of the week unless something major happens.&rdquo;The latter will be Ingwe&rsquo;s fourth signing in this month after capturing Ugandan Keziron Kizito, Burundian international Alexis Kitenge and their old boy Mussa Mudde .
