The IEBC yesterday cleared four governor aspirants to contest in the August election. Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya (pictured)of Jubilee Party was the first to be cleared. He was followed by Chirau Mwakwere of Wiper, Sammy Ruwa (indipendent) and Issah Chipera of ODM. Mvurya asked opponents to engage in issue-based politics, not propaganda. &ldquo;It is the beginning of getting another term after being cleared by the IEBC. We will focus on asking residents to vote for us, depending on what we have done,&rdquo; he said. Mvurya said they will campaign for the reelection of President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto, saying their administration has initiated development projects. Kwale Deputy Governor Fatuma Achani said residents will elect them and Jubilee because of their track record. &ldquo;We will conduct peaceful campaigns and sell our policies,&rdquo; she said. Achani said opponents should tell voters what they have done, instead of resorting to propaganda. Ruwa said he is ready to seek the mandate from voters. &ldquo;I feel like luggage has been taken away. This is the first step to the August election. We are now going to seek voters&rsquo; clearance in August,&rdquo; he said after IEBC cleared him.Chipera said, &ldquo;We want to win with a bang. By 6.30 in the evening of August 8, Kwale people will be knowing that I&rsquo;m their governor.&rdquo; Mwakwere said he will continue campaigning &ldquo;secretly&rdquo;. &ldquo;Our campaigns remain a secret so that our opponents will ask where we are and later find that we have won.&rdquo;
