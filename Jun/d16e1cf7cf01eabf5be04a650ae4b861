A Jubilee parliamentary candidate has asked nominations losers to respect residents and stop using above words.Limuru MP aspirant Peter Mwathi said the debate about stolen votes tarnishes the party&rsquo;s name.&ldquo;When you go to different places in the county, a lot of JP candidates are labelled thieves, that they rigged the nominations. How can even those who got 20 [votes] claim they were stolen?&rdquo; he asked.Mwathi spoke on Sunday in Limuru town. He urged politicians to campaign peacefully and seek votes wisely.Mwathi urged voters to ignore leaders who claim their votes were stolen, since there has to be a winner and a loser in any competition.&ldquo;If I lost, I would have accepted the results and supported the winner. In this constituency, for example, two allege I stole,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;I was taken to the party&rsquo;s complaints commission and later to the party&rsquo;s tribunal and their applications were thrown out for lack of evidence.&rdquo;Mwathi beat MP John Kiragu with 18,456 votes against Kiragu&rsquo;s 14,786 votes.
