The destiny of Boda boda rider Destiny Gitau has changed after he became famous in Lari, Kiambu county, for giving President Uhuru Kenyatta a Bible as a Father&rsquo;s Day present.Speaking in Kimende on Wednesday, an excited Destiny said Uhuru asked for his phone number and he is now eagerly waiting for a call from the President.Many people have been sending him congratulatory messages and have described him as creative.They said that because of heavy security, they didn&rsquo;t expect Destiny to be able to sit just two rows behind the President at St Peter and Paul Catholic Church, Kiambu town, on Sunday.&ldquo;When I saw him delivering the gift, I thought it was someone who looks like him or I was dreaming,&rdquo; resident Robert Kimani said.Destiny, who many thought was a pastor with evangelical churches, said he gave the President a Gideon&rsquo;s Bible.&ldquo;I was given that Bible by a friend after the 2013 general election, and something told me that I should give it to the President one day,&rdquo; Destiny said.&ldquo;I have been looking for chances to give it to him. Every time he visits Kiambu county, I normally carry it but I don&rsquo;t get a chance to present it.&rdquo;The boda boda rider explains that on Sunday, he made up his mind that he was destined to deliver it as a Father&rsquo;s Day gift and arrived at the church very early in the morning.&ldquo;I was smartly dressed in a suit and a maroon tie. I pretended I was a leader. When the President arrived, I was among those he greeted and I followed other leaders and sat behind him,&rdquo; he said.After the President and Deputy President William Ruto addressed the worshippers, Destiny took the Bible to the presiding priest.&ldquo;The father placed it on a table and went on to end the mass, but I quickly rose and went to him. All people watched us,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;He quickly said, &lsquo;Mr President, we have a pastor who wants to give you a present&rsquo;. Even before he finished, I took the Bible and the President came [over] and we shook hands and he took [it],&rdquo; Destiny said.
