The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission today decides the political future of Wiper&rsquo;s Machakos governor candidate Wavinya Ndeti.The Kalonzo Musyoka-led party will not have a candidate for the race at the August 8 polls if the IEBC Tribunal, which has been hearing nominations-related complaints, finds that it was wrong for the party to nominate her.The tribunal is set to rule on a petition in which the former Kathiani MP is accused of violating the law by becoming a member of Wiper on April 6, a day after the defection deadline set by the commission. The IEBC, in a circular, provided April 5 as the last day for aspirants to switch parties if they wanted to participate in the upcoming polls.But Ndeti&rsquo;s problem is not just about the IEBC timeline. It is three-pronged.Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama, in an affidavit being considered by the tribunal, says Wiper rules provide that for individuals to be cleared to run for governor on the party ticket, they must demonstrate active participation in party programmes three months prior to seeking its nomination.The party provides a leeway through which one can be considered if the time is less than three months or a hopeful has not been active.In such an event, Muthama says only the party&rsquo;s National Executive Council may, for a good cause, exempt an applicant from the requirement.&ldquo;The National Executive Council has never met to exempt Wavinya Ndeti from the clear provision of Article 17.3.1 (IV) of the party constitution,&rdquo; Muthama says.He says the party &ldquo;allowed a stranger to participate in its primaries&rdquo;, contrary to the Elections Act, 2011.Ndeti is also fighting claims that she is a member of both Wiper and Chama Cha Uzalendo.If proved true, this is in contravention of Section 14-5 of the Political Parties Act.The law states that a person shall not be a member of more than one political party at the same time.The tribunal will be considering a letter by IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati dated May 26. In the letter, it only recognised Ndeti as the CCU leader in line with a High Court order.The High Court issued the order after some CCU members moved to court to oust Ndeti from the party&rsquo;s helm.In a ruling on May 11, Justice George Odunga issued orders to the Registrar of Political Parties Lucy Ndung&rsquo;u to enter Ndeti&rsquo;s name into the list of party officials.Ndeti was handed the Wiper ticket to run for Machakos governor after she trounced Deputy Governor Bernard Kiala in almost all polling stations &mdash; garnering 299,312 votes against Kiala&rsquo;s 4,663.Wiper had initially been barred by the Political Parties Dispute Tribunal from presenting Ndeti&rsquo;s name to the IEBC as their governor candidate for the county. The three-member tribunal ordered Wiper to repeat the nomination within 48 hours, having ruled that the party conducted the primaries against a court order that advised otherwise.The tribunal later directed the party to nominate Wavinya as its candidate for governor in Machakos county.This was on the ground that it would be pointless to conduct a repeat poll yet her main challenger Kiala had announced he would now be running as an independent candidate.Another candidate in the Machakos governor race is incumbent Alfred Mutua of Maendeleo Chap Chap.Mutua cut links with Wiper after he fell out with Kalonzo. He is supporting President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s reelection. The county is a perceived Wiper and NASA stronghold.
