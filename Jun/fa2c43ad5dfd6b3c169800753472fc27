The Kenya Alliance of Independent Candidates will lhold campaign rallies in the North Rift next week to support its members vying for various seats in the region. There are more than 120 independents in the North Rift, most of whom quit Jubilee after primaries.Businessman Bundotich Kiprop popularly known as Buzeki (pictured) who is the alliance&rsquo;s vice chairman, confirmed they were planning the rallies, and will be led by Kiambu Governor William Kabogo who is the chairman.&ldquo;We are organising the rallies and we will soon give full details,&rdquo; Buzeki said.The move will counter joint campaigns by Jubilee candidates, led by Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago.Buzeki defended independents vying in the Rift Valley, saying they have a democratic right to do so, and will win many seats because the Jubilee primaries held in April were flawed.Buzeki, who is vying for governor in Uasin Gishu as an independent, has asked Mandago to stop spearheading a joint onslaught by Jubilee aspirants against the independents.&ldquo;If he thinks we are inconsequential as independent candidates, then let him stop going all over crying about us. We will not be cowed or intimidated by anyone,&rdquo; Buzeki said.
