The stage is set for the fourth round of the 2017 Kenya National Rally Championship in Kajiado County on June 16-17. The event will be flagged off at Galleria Mall and end at Champagne Park, Kipeto in Kajiado county.Focus will be on Tapio Laukkanen, who returns where he has previously swept the ground with all his opponents. The Flying Finn is set to renew his rivalry with the top Kenyan drivers including Jaspreet Chatthe, Carl Tundo, Baldev Chager and Ian Duncan. Tapio leads the KNRC log on 63 points and will be hoping to amass more points in his quest for back-to-back titles.After retiring in the season opener in Mombasa, Tapio snatched the KNRC lead from Ian Duncan on completing a rare hatrick of wins in Eldoret. It will be interesting to see how the Kenyan speedsters will approach the event. Former KNRC champion Chatthe, who led the initial stages of Eldoret Rally, is preparing his car in Kisumu and hopes to overcome the jinx which has affected his run. After three rallies, he is placed seventh.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad the Kenyan boys are getting faster and faster by each event while trying to chase Tapio. But from his pace it seems we got lots of catching up to do before matching his times. All in all, the championship is more competitive,&rdquo; said Chatthe. He finished second overall in Eldoret and will be hoping to up his game as the events enter halfway stage in Kajiado. Tapio has outpaced the Kenyan bigwigs by bigger margins on the long stages and has been equally competitive on the short stages.
