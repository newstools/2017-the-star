President Uhuru Kenyatta and NASA presidential Raila Odinga's battle for youth and women's votes is set to intensify towards the August 8 election, as each comes up with programmes to entice the two groups.On Tuesday, the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission announced that the youth aged between 18 to 34 years account for more than half the total number of registered voters.The age group accounts for 9,930,315 valid voters from the total 19,611,423 registered.The commission says the register has a 47 per cent female representation and 53 per cent male representation.This week, both Uhuru and Raila launched their manifestos with weighty promises to the youth. On Monday, Uhuru said his government, if reelected, intends to create 1.3 million jobs each year by working with devolved governments to set up at least one industry in every county.The President also said his administration will give the youth a paid-up internship.&ldquo;Beginning next year, university, polytechnic and technical training institute students will be offered a one-to-one paid internship. This is one of the programmes that will expand opportunities for young people in addition to our ongoing youth empowerment initiatives," he said.Apart from the JP's Youth League, several youth groups, including the Tokelezea Vijana na UhuRuto, have been formed in majority of counties to spearhead the UhuRuto campaigns.Yesterday, one of the leaders of the Tokelezea Vajana na UhuRuto, Zack Kinuthia, said the Jubilee manifesto will empower youths. "As youth, we have seen we will continue to greatly benefit from the Jubilee government because it has our interests on top of their agenda," he said.On the other hand, the former Prime Minister in his manifesto that he launched on Tuesday said his government would come up with ways to engage the youth in business.Raila said the Youth Enterprise Development Fund has not helped the targetted people because of bureaucracy.On women, Raila promised that his government would create a fund to be managed by the woman representatives to enable marginalised groups get more access to capital.
