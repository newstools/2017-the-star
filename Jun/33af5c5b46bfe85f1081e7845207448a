Lugari MP Ayub Savula has told President Uhuru Kenyatta to let the court do its work in the case filed by NASA challenging the legality of the award of the ballot printing tender to Dubai firm Al Ghurair.He faulted the President for saying the opposition&rsquo;s demand for transparency and accountability in the awarding of the Sh2.5bn tender is a plot to delay the polls.Savula said the remark was tantamount to interfering with the judicial process. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell us the opposition is inciting Kenyans because they are not ready for the election. NASA is simply asking that the law be respected in transacting public affairs, especially of the magnitude of a General Election,&rdquo; he said. Addressing his supporters at Kiwanja Ndege on Friday, Savula said Uhuru should leave independent institutions to freely discharge their duties to guarantee a peaceful and credible election. NASA has said Al Ghurair has close links with Uhuru&rsquo;s family. On Thursday, NASA moved to the High Court, seeking to have the tender cancelled and awarded to another company through a competitive process. Savula said the appellate court ruling on Friday that upheld the High Court&rsquo;s verdict that presidential results announced at the constituency level are final is a victory for Kenyans. &ldquo;There will be no stealing of votes this time round,&rdquo; he said.Savula said Luhyas now stand a better chance of ascending to power in 2022.
