The President left nothing at a Nakuru school but Sh200,000 to buy loaves of bread, governor aspirant Peter Koros has said.Koros (CCM) blasted President Uhuru Kenyatta, who was at Amalo Secondary School, saying the bread will not contribute to development."How can a whole President of the Republic, who is seeking re-election, go without leaving even a coin for residents of both Kuresoi North and South constituencies?" he asked.He addressed Knut officials from Kuresoi South in Olenguruone on Saturday.Uhuru toured Nyandarua and Nakuru counties from June 2. During the three-day meet-the-people-tour, he highlighted the major achievements of his administration ahead of the August 8 general election.The politician said what the President left behind was a clear indication that he has no regard for the people.He added that locals from the region who survive on agriculture and dairy farming have been exploited by poor milk and potato prices that Uhuru and DP William Ruto did not mention."It is unfortunate that his government recently kicked out 1,278 families for construction of Itare dam yet he is dishing out money for IDPs across the country," he said.Election laws prohibit leaders from giving money to supporters during campaigns.More on this: [VIDEO] Never again, Uhuru says as state pays Nyamira IDPs Sh470 millionAlso read: Rutto takes tea with Itare Dam IDPs, names camps after UhuRutoKenyans and leaders have criticised the Jubilee administration since prices for basic commodities such as maize flour, bread and milk increased.Uhuru promised solutions, which have included imports from countries such as South Africa, and the provision of subsidised maize flour.Also see:Koros was with Nakuru NASA chairman Ole Sono and CCM woman representative candidate Gladys Kamuren.Sono said Governor Kinuthia Mbugua's leadership has left members of KAMATUSA, "who did not benefit from any county cake", depressed.He said IEBC records show the organisation has 700,000 registered voters."
