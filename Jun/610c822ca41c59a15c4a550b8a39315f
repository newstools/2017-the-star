The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission has warned that it will ensure the law on integrity is complied with when clearing candidates for the August 8 polls.The caution may send shockwaves among candidates with questionable integrity who have already been cleared by the IEBC, amid fears their certificates could be recalled.In the commission&rsquo;s update on the progress of enforcement of Chapter Six of the Constitution, the IEBC said it has the legal mandate to enforce leadership and integrity law.The Wafula Chebukati-led commission issued the tough stance yesterday after various governors and parliamentary aspirants were cleared by returning officers, despite facing integrity questions.Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho, who is battling prosecution over falsification of academic certificates, was among high-profile leaders who were given the green light by the commission to contest the election.But the electoral agency said it had received 106 cases from the Ethics and Anti-corruption Commission on the enforcement of integrity and leadership, which it is reviewing before making a decision.According to the report from the EACC, one governor has been convicted, six have pending cases while 11 are under investigations.There are, however, no names given.
