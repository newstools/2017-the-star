Comedienne Teacher Wanjiku has dressed up like a baby to drive home a point. She joins comedians from around the world in the #5for5 campiagn that advocates&ndash; nutrition, health, learning, play and protection for children under five.&ldquo;I love Their World&rsquo;s #5for5 campaign because I can relate to it as my 20 month old daughter is my biggest motivation. This campaign proves that every child below the age of 5 needs to have good nutrition for proper development, so they can grow into healthy adults,&rdquo; Wanjiku said.A new Their World report called &lsquo;Bright and Early&rsquo; released this month warns that the severe lack of investment in early years support puts millions of children at a disadvantage before they even start school. Campaigners are calling on world leaders meeting at the G20 Summit in Germany in July to commit to a dramatic increase in funding for pre-primary education.Wanjiku added that as a working mum it is not easy. &ldquo; I love challenges they make me strong and keeps me going the best thing that i have come to realise is that you have to find balance in everything that you do whether you are a working mother, stay at home mum or otherwise life is about balance, balance it!&rdquo;
