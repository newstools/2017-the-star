Politicians need to give the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission the space to do its job of delivering the forthcoming General Election.The IEBC needs to deliver the election professionally, lawfully and in a process that is aboveboard from start to finish.Undue influence and constant criticism and suspicion will not do. Kenyans need to trust their institutions. The managers of these institutions need to do their work well.Perception is everything and frequently discrediting the IEBC can impact negatively on its image.The currency the IEBC transacts in is trust. The credibility of the 12th General Election on August 8 will depend to a very great extent on the IEBC&rsquo;s own credibility.Few national electoral agencies around the world have undergone the scale of criticism and turnover that the IEBC has experienced in recent years and months. With only 50 days to go to Election Day, all indications are that the present set of commissioners and the secretariat will handle these polls. This is one institution that does not have failure as an option.
