With the launch of the SGR, business is booming at the Coast, with three youths making money by delivering tickets or transporting people to the train station.Since Monday, 35-year-old John Ogutu has been delivering Madaraka Express tickets to travellers who do not want the hassle of the Kibarani traffic and long queues at the Miritini train station.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing this because there is opportunity ... Plus, I have a family to feed,&rdquo; he said.Ogutu decided to start the venture a week ago when he travelled to Nairobi, but missed the Sunday train as it was full.&ldquo;I had to leave on Monday, and when I was planning to come back, a friend and I sent some cash to a friend&rsquo;s brother, who switched off his phone and never booked [the train for us]. We had to use a bus and all along I told my friend how those in the train had arrived already,&rdquo; he told the Star.&ldquo;I told my friend Carter that when I get to Mombasa I will open an agency so that we don&rsquo;t rely on friends and relatives who at times disappoint [us].&rdquo;Ogutu charges Sh200 service fee to deliver the tickets that go for Sh700. He started the business with only Sh2,000 for fuel for his motorcycle, designing fliers and making calls.He has partnered with Eric Omollo.In North Coast, at Naivas Centre, a businessman identified as Allan has advertised that his company Orion will be ferrying Mombasa passengers to Miritini at Sh500 and will charge Sh400 from Miritini to town.A Kenya Railways bus has also been shuttling passengers between the old Railway office in town and Miritini.
