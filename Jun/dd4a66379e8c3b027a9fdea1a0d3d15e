All is not well for President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto in Kericho county, following protests from officials and officers over allowances. Corridors has been told that some of the officials and security officers from the Prisons department are yet to be paid their money for the work they did during the JP primaries.The officials want JP secretary general Raphael Tuju to intervene and explain to them who was given the money. Failing which they will campaign against Jubilee Party, which enjoys nearly fanatical support in the region. === A senior Jubilee honcho from a populous county in Rift Valley panicked last week, following reports that his busy schedule with the presidential campaigns could cost him his reelection. His main rival challenging the vocal lawmaker on another party ticket has capitalised on his extended absence to make massive inroads at the grassroots. At some point voters were questioning if the MP had mistaken his victory at the Jubilee primaries for a win at the General Election. The lawmaker has reportedly abandoned the presidential campaigns and retreated back home to put out the fire touched off by his main opponent - or else risk being sent into political oblivion after the August 8 polls. === Have witchcraft claims emerged again in Tharaka Nithi? A little bird has chirped to Corridors that black magic might be in use in the strongholds ahead of the August election. A swarm of bees was spotted on a governor aspirant's billboards. Our source tells us the swarm of bees later flew to an office of the rival politician. Residents are left wondering which one of the two aspirants might be using witchcraft. === Just why did the Teacher's Service Commission rescind the promotions of at least 2,000 teachers, only weeks after issuing appointment letters following successful interviews? The teachers' employer is said to have quietly sent out a memo to the Human Resource Department to make downward salary adjustments for the teachers whose promotions had been recalled. This move may jolt the dreams of higher pay of many teachers, having worked hard to rise up the cadre promotion ladder. Corridors is informed some of the replacements in the initial list of those promoted come from just one tribe, raising questions about the commission's impartiality and infiltration by political factors.
