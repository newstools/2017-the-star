Technical University of Mombasa acting vice chancellor Laila Abubakar has warned that hooligans and exam cheats will be expelled.She said on Monday that no violent protest will be condoned and vandals will be have it rough.The VC said violence and cheating undermine the quality of graduates seeking jobs.Abubakar spoke at TUM&rsquo;s Tudor main campus during the swearing in of new student leaders of the Technical University of Mombasa Students&rsquo; Organisation.Students Daniel Otieno and Jackline Nzisa won in a landslide in polls last week to become TUMSO president and deputy president, respectively, for one year. &ldquo;You risk being expelled once caught cheating in exams. This is because we have since changed the university statutes and the VC&rsquo;s appeal is the final stage, once one is found guilty by the disciplinary committee,&rdquo; Abubakar said.TUM and other universities have strict rules on students caught cheating in exams.During the academic year 2016-17, TUM did not record any unrest, despite being known for violent protests.Abubakar said TUM&rsquo;s reputation risks being ruined if protesters are not reined in. &ldquo;Employers out there are keen on the integrity of any graduate before offering a job. Keep off from any cases of unrest as that could threaten your chances of getting employed,&rdquo; she said.
