Devolution CS Mwangi Kiunjuri has threatened to expose Kiambu Governor William Kabogo&rsquo;s shady business deals, following his constant attacks on President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto.Kiunjuri yesterday questioned Kabogo&rsquo;s wealth, saying his businesses are shrouded in secrecy and Kiambu people and Kenyans in general should be told about it. Equating him to a drunkard who falls into a ditch full of stench and then mocks a worshipper into a fight, the former Water assistant minister said Kabogo&rsquo;s wealth would never propel him to leadership.Kiunjuri added that the governor will be tasked to explain the source of his immense wealth.The former Laikipia East MP was speaking during a community participatory meeting at a Nanyuki hotel organised by the Devolution Ministry to educate the public on governance.&ldquo;During his tenure as Juja MP, Kabogo contributed little and most of his motions were only aimed at defending his mysterious businesses. He should be reminded that he spent time attending to inquests to absolve himself on mysterious deaths that had occurred on highways,&rdquo; Kiunjuri said.Kabogo has been quoted telling the DP not to expect automatic support from Mt Kenya in his 2022 bid for President.
