Olympic 5000m silver medallist Hellen Obiri is ready to take over the mantle from Olympic champion over the distance Vivian Cheruiyot, who has upgraded to distance running.Obiri&rsquo;s first major task will be during the 2017 World Championships, where she will be seeking to take over the dominance previously a preserve of the pint-sized Cheruiyot, alongside Margaret Chelimo.Vivian had drawn lines of class by dominating the 5,000m and 10,000m races for almost two decades and her exit to road races leaves Obiri, a 1500m graduate to stake her claim among the greatest.&ldquo;I feel the weight on my shoulders after Vivian&rsquo;s exit. I feel the whole world has set its eyes on me. Once we report to camp, we will draft ways of securing victory (with Chelimo) just like we did with Vivian at the Rio Olympics,&rdquo; said Obiri.&ldquo;Ethiopians offer stiff challenge but I believe we will try by all means to beat them. Clearly, I am the senior and most experienced but this does not mean a direct win. We must work for it.&rdquo;Obiri showed her class in the trials by running from gun-to-tape in the 12-lap race, clocking 15:28.9 ahead of Chelimo, the All African Games champion, who recorded 15:30.7 to finish second. Sheila Chepkirui finished third on 15:33.6.Acording to Obiri, team work and proper coordination between them will be crucial in delivering success. &ldquo;Proper coordination between us will enable us beat our opponents easily. I personally want to improve on speed especially in the final lap. I am in good shape and ready for London. It is a competitive race and I will not underrate anyone.&rdquo;Kenyan athletes will be forced to work harder in taming and caging their opponents especially the Ethiopian trio of Olympic bronze medalist Almaz Ayana, 2012 Olympic champion Meseret Defar and 2015&rsquo;s World bronze medalist Genzebe Dibaba.
