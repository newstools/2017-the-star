The chairman of Budalang’i Theatre Community Based Organisation David Wanga yesterday urged residents of Funyula constituency, Samia subcounty, to attend a free eye clinic at Nangina Mission Hospital, which started yesterday and ends on Friday. “Attend the eye clinic in large numbers for treatment,” WangÍa said. The camp, organised by Budalang’i Theatre CBO in collaboration with Fred Hollows Foundation, held a similar clinic at Port Victoria Hospital last week. More than 500  people with eye complications were attended to. Budalang’i Theatre CBO has assisted many orphans and vulnerable children in Budalang’i constituency through various projects, which include poultry keeping and goat rearing. “Out of 10,000 HIV-Aids orphans and vulnerable children in the Budalang’i constituency, Budalang’i Theatre CBO in collaboration with the outgoing Aphia Plus Western have managed to assist 6,000 OVCs  by paying fees and providing them with shoes,” Wanga said.
