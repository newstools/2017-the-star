President Uhuru Kenyatta has accused the Opposition of derailing the August 8 polls to push for a transitional government.The President said the Opposition's scheme to derail the polls is well documented."It started when they asked for a complete overhaul of the commissioners of the IEBC," he said in Londiani, Kericho County on Thursday.Uhuru said Jubilee did not agree with the request but allowed the replacement of commissioners."They went on making demands and the next thing they targeted was the BVR, then they went for the secretariat. Now they want to stop the printing of ballot papers," Uhuru said.Read: NASA links Jubilee officials to Al Ghurair tender, wants Chiloba sackedAlso read: Dubai ballot printing firm asked Uhuru for contractUhuru said the general election will go ahead as planned "despite the Opposition's attempts to sabotage the process".He asked the team led by NASA principal Raila Odinga to stop using shortcuts to rise to the helm of the country's leadership."They (NASA) are creating obstacles in order to ask for the creation of a coalition transitional government."The head of state advised his opponents to sell ideas that can convince Kenyans to support their bid."Enough is enough. We will not accept their attempts to postpone elections," he said."We know their game but we will now allow Kenyans to be denied their democratic right to choose the leaders they want on the date stipulated by the constitution."The President further said the Opposition appears to be afraid and is placing obstacle after obstacle to derail the polls.Deputy President William Ruto said the government will not allow the Opposition to create a crisis."If you want to lead Kenyans, you must go and ask for votes. You cannot trick or blackmail your way to ruling the country," Ruto said.The DP said Jubilee Party undoubtedly enjoys overwhelming support and challenged the Opposition to "throw in the towel"."I would suggest that they forget about this poll and start preparing to face me in 2022," he said.Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen said the ballots printing row was driven by Opposition leaders' greed for money. Murkomen alleged Raila is bitter because he missed an opportunity to control the procurement processes at the IEBC."In 2007, he was the one who single-sourced the BVR. All the noise he is making is because he missed an opportunity to control the tenders."The leaders said Jubilee will not mind Opposition leaders running the IEBC because it is Kenyans who will vote and not the commission.More on this: Raila dangerously derailing IEBC with Al Ghurair tender claims - ChebukatiAlso see: [VIDEO] Give ballot tender to Raila's Spectre International, Jubilee will still win poll - RutoThe leaders spoke during campaigns in Kericho county to mobilise voters ahead of the polls.They started the tourin Kipsitet and Fort Ternan before driving through Londiani, Barsiele, Chepseon and heading to Kericho town.The President and his team will also visit Kapsoit, Sosion, Sigowet, Roret, Cheborge and Litein and wind up with a rally at the historic Kapkatet Grounds.
