Former Devolution CS and JP candidate for Kirinyaga governor Ann Waiguru yesterday said she will appoint Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua a village elder, if she is elected. She said this soon after being cleared by the IEBC at St Michael&rsquo;s Primary School in Kerugoya town. He expressed confidence that he will win. Waiguru (pictured) said her rival Karua is old and should have run for higher office or quit politics all together. She was accompanied by her running mate Peter Ndambiri. Waiguru said she has no personal differences with incumbent Joseph Ndathi, who is in the race as an independent. She defeated him in the JP polls.Waiguru said she understands the problems faced by Kirinyaga residents and is capable of taking the county to new heights in development.Her clearance came barely two weeks after the National Assembly&rsquo;s Public Accounts Committee recommended she be barred from holding any public office. She declined to respond to questions by a Star journalist when asked about PAC&rsquo;s decision.Last week, the National Assembly adopted that critical report by the powerful parliamentary watchdog. The report said she should be subjected to a lifestyle audit to determine the source of her income.
