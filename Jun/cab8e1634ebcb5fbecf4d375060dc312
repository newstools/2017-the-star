The electoral commission yesterday said its integrated electoral technology will provide &ldquo;foolproof authentication&rdquo; to ensure there is no mischief on Election Day.Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission chairman Wafula Chebukati said the agency is aware the register of voters cannot be completely rid of deceased persons.&ldquo;However, we are confident that the Kenya Integrated Electoral Management System provides foolproof authentication on Election Day and there will be no room for mischief,&rdquo; he said at a press conference at the IEBC headquarters in Anniversary Towers, Nairobi.The commission said it has deleted 88,602 dead voters from the register, bringing the total number of registered voters to 19,611,423.This number includes 4,393 diaspora voters in five countries and 5,528 registered in 118 prisons in Kenya.Comparatively, the register of voters has increased by 36 per cent ( 5,222,642 voters) since 2013.&ldquo;The commission was provided a total of 92,277 records of deceased persons. However, this number was later revised to 88,602 by KPMG after notification that the difference could be that of reportees,&rdquo; Chebukati said.The Register of Voters will be made available online and via SMS for inspection from Thursday until Election Day.However, no changes will be made to the final register of voters to be gazetted this week.Audit firm KPMG conducted an audit of the register of voters and handed its report to the IEBC with far-reaching recommendations that included deletion of dead voters from the voters roll.The current Register of Voters consists of those registered in 2012 for the 2013 election, Continuous Voter Registration and Mass Voter Registration phase I and II, the Diaspora and prisoners.In terms of gender representation, the commission said 53 per cent of those registered are male compared to 47 per cent female.
