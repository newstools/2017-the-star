Some Kalenjins living in Nakuru have questioned why President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto did not tell woman representative aspirants to step down in favour of JP nominee Liza Chelule.This comes two days after the two led talks at the Nakuru state lodge that made Governor Kinuthia Mbugua bow out of the race in favour of former NTSA boss and JP nominee Lee Kinyanjui.Resident Juliana Tanui yesterday said Uhuru and Ruto fixed Chelule, who faces competition from Grace Karuga of Kanu and independents Agnes Njambi and Rev Zipporah Maina. &ldquo;We have three Jubilee woman rep candidates and one NASA candidate, who is likely to win as the three divide the votes,&rdquo; she said.Jacqueline Soi, from Mauche area, said, &ldquo;We have heard Mbugua has been promised a Cabinet job so he backs Lee while we are just here without any seat.&rdquo;
