Nyandarua residents are empty-headed that is why they support Jubilee governor candidate Francis Kimemia, Governor Daniel Waithaka has said.He said after Kimemia was sacked as Secretary to the Cabinet by the President on corruption allegations he ran to Wanjiku in Nyandarua. "No wonder somebody has said the people of Nyandarua have nothing between their ears. If they had, they would chase him away. I'm sorry to say that,&rdquo; Waithaka said.He spoke outside his offices in Ol Kalou town during the swearing in of two new executives and a chief officer.Amon Kinyanjui (Financial and Economic Planning) has replaced Nderi Ndiani, who is now the county assembly clerk.Martin Kamami (Energy, Water and Environment) has taken over from Grace Gitonga, who resigned to run for Ndaragwa MP.Daniel Muguku is the new chief officer of Finance and Economic Planning, replacing Gitau Njoroge, who has been in an acting capacity since 2014, after Michael Kamau was pushed out on corruption allegations.Waithaka said Kimemia is a foreigner who has &ldquo;invaded our homesteads&rdquo; and urged residents not to support him.Foreigners, he said, are like hyenas that will go away with goats and sheep, or like lions, which will take the celebrated bull to the forest and leave you struggling.Waithaka asked residents why they would support Kimemia, yet he did nothing for Nyandarua when he was in high places.He accused Kimemia of disrespecting his administration and threatening to send him and his staff to jail for misappropriation of public funds. &ldquo;I am not going to allow anybody to intimidate me. I will not allow it,&rdquo; he said.Kimemia, while traversing Nyandarua to sell his agenda, never loses an opportunity to tell residents that those who have misused their resources will be called to account once he is elected governor.This has endeared him to the populace to the chagrin of the incumbent.
