That we are in a season of drought in Kenya, with food shortage experienced countrywide, is not news any more.Lack of most basic commodities, such as maize flour, sugar and milk, has led to moments of panic across the country, with the government stepping in to subsidise prices of maize flour.However, for shrewd, small-scale farmers such as Edward Ouko, known in the community as Eddy, the effects of the drought have bypassed their homes. He has learnt to farm other crops successfully, thanks to advocacy efforts and community groups that work together to encourage farmers.For communities in Busia and Kisumu, growing alternative crops enables them to make a living and meet their family needs. Their efforts are now bearing fruit, as they get bounty harvests and surplus for sale. This is thanks to community-based organisations working with World Neighbours, who train farmers on alternative crops to grow and different methods of crop production and livestock husbandry.LESS FARM INPUTSWorld Neighbours, an NGO based in Oklahoma City, runs community-based agriculture programmes in Kenya&rsquo;s Busia and Kimumu counties in 1,800 households and 22 villages.Along with their local partners, World Neighbours has helped introduce new crops, greenhouses, solar technology and sustainable methods that reduce the use of farm inputs and encourage rooftop water harvesting for farming.The farmers are grouped in common interest groups to learn from one another, depending on their interests. For instance, a group of farmers interested in keeping dairy goats can be formed so that farmers can learn best practice from each other.&ldquo;World Neighbours introduced rearing dairy goats and poultry-keeping to us," Eddy said."I also cultivate maize, sorghum, butternut, beans, mangoes and an assortment of traditional and exotic vegetables. I have acquired enough skills in agronomy, and now I engage in farming as a business rather than just for subsistence. I am happy to say the fortunes of my family have improved. I can produce enough maize, sorghum, beans, groundnut and cassava for household consumption and for the market.&rdquo;In his group, they have farmed tomatoes, watermelons, cowpeas, green pepper, butternuts, eggplants and amaranth.Out of his farming activities, Eddy has been able to educate his children. His daughter is now waiting to join college, while his son is in form two.CLIMATE-EFFICIENTHe attributes his ability to do all these, even build a new house, to embracing new climate-efficient agricultural practices.&ldquo;Two years ago, I was recognised by the Kisumu government as a model farmer and chosen to host the annual World Food Day, during which many farmers and government extension workers came to learn from my farming experiences."World Neighbours trains farmers in the production, processing and marketing of their produce, as well as how to run a successful, small-scale businesses as other forms of income generation.Eddy&rsquo;s words of advise to other small-scale farmers is to grab the opportunities climate change has brought.&ldquo;In spite of numerous challenges, climate change has also provided opportunities for innovation in the way agriculture is practiced. It cannot be business as usual, but we can manage the threat of water scarcity by adopting innovative soil and water management techniques, planting improved seeds and keeping improved varieties of livestock.&rdquo; He recommends shifting from the monoculture of maize production to diversifying crops and restoring soil fertility by using compost manure as well as green manure cover crops. Chris Macoloo of World Neighbours says farmer participation in agricultural value chains and particularly in value addition and marketing improves their incomes. It also cushions them against the predatory and exploitative activities of middlemen or intermediaries, who buy cheaply at farm gate prices and sell at exorbitant profits. He says farmers have teamed up to establish 'cereal banks', where they collectively store some of their produce during harvest when prices are low, and then sell later when prices improve, thus increasing their earnings from agricultural produce.
