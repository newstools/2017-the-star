The brother of Kapsoya MCA aspirant James Ratemo yesterday denied killing the politician&rsquo;s three children.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not true,&rdquo; Enock Kebwage Onsase said when he appeared before Eldoret High Court judge Daniel Ogembo under tight security.He is accused of colluding with others on May 13 to kill Clifford Nyambane, 6, Tanny Nyamweya, 5, and Glen Ongaki, 3. The three were buried in Kisii on Friday last week.Onsase&rsquo;s lawyer Ntenga Marube urged the court to release him on bond pending the hearing of his case.Ogembo set the bond hearing for July 3.State Counsel Job Mulati said, &ldquo;Because of the fact that three of the witnesses are minors we apply that the case be heard at a very early date so that they can give their testimony as soon as possible.&rdquo; He said this would enable them to easily recall events.The early hearing date will be considered on June 20, the judge said.Some of Ratemo&rsquo;s relatives were in court yesterday when Onsase was produced to face charges.Witnesses have claimed that Onsase was the last person seen with the children when they disappeared from their home in Kapsoya while on the way to Eldoville SDA Church.Their decomposing bodies were found dumped in the River Nzoia near Moi&rsquo;s Bridge. A postmortem done at the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital revealed that the children may have been strangled.A second suspect who had been arrested was released after investigations showed he was not linked to the murders.Earlier, the murders were linked to a family dispute over land.
