That is like saying you are not ready for the elections. Elections will go on as planned," he said in his address at Buguta in Voi on Thursday when he distributed relief food.The Cabinet Secretary noted Jubilee Party will floor the National Super Alliance in the August 8 vote.&ldquo;Many strong candidates have left their team and joined us. They come to you empty-handed but today we have brought you food," he said."We shall distribute relief food until the rains come and you harvest enough food from your farms. We have invested billions in development projects in this region and therefore urge you to support us." He continued: "We defeated them when Uhuru and the DP had court cases at the ICC. Will they beat us when we are free?"Kiunjuri is on a two day tour of Taita Taveta county. He was with Natural resources PS Margaret Mwakima, Taita Taveta county commissioner Kula Hache, Jubilee women represenative aspirant Lydia Haika and Voi parliamentary aspirant Dishon Mngoda.Mwakima said that the government will fence Tsavo National Park to prevent more cases of human-wildlife conflict.She said the government has finished compensating families whose relatives were killed by animals between 2013 and 2016.&ldquo;Due to limited funds, we have prioritised compensation but we are trying to work out measures for insurance cover for victims,&rdquo; she said.She urged the people to vote for Jubilee leaders.Raila said on Tuesday that information they have indicates Al Ghurair Printing &amp; Publishing has had contracts with senior Jubilee officials for at least three years.He asked IEBC to review the tender award process but IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati said the rhetoric on the procurement is dangerous.President Uhuru Kenyatta earlier accused the Opposition of derailing the August 8 polls to push for a transitional government.The President said the Opposition's scheme to derail the election is well documented.He noted the general election will go ahead as planned "despite the Opposition's attempts to sabotage the process".More on this: Raila dangerously derailing IEBC with Al Ghurair tender claims - ChebukatiAlso read: Raila creating IEBC tender row to push for 'nusu mkate' government - Uhuru
