The government has announced it will deploy National Youth Service officers to parts of Central , where there has been an invasion of armyworm.This is not the first place an armyworm infestation has been reported. For the last three months, farmers in the counties of Busia, Bungoma, Trans Nzoia and Kakamega have been grappling with the dreaded fall worm, which has destroyed millions of acres of maize crop.In Western and parts of Rift Valley, Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Willy Bett visited some farmers, but left them to their own devices to buy whatever chemicals they deemed necessary. The farmers also provided or paid for the labour as they battled the devastating crop pest.Now the government has decided to provide chemicals and labour, through the NYS, for the farmers in Mt Kenya and parts of Rift Valley.Whereas the government has the right and obligation to help farmers deal with the problem, it&rsquo;s wrong for the state to create the perception that some regions are more important than others.
