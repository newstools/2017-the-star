Felix Sergon said on Facebook. Ann Biwott said: "...we lost the lives of many [of] our people in Baringo. I will never vote for you because you didn't, at any given point ,show any attempt to fight banditry and bring back peace."But on Thursday, Gideon dismissed claims he is supporting bandit attacks in volatile parts of the country."I have no mandate to stop the security operations since I have no military powers to do so," he said.The Senator noted he supports KDF's ongoing operation to flush out bandits that commenced two months ago."People have always had a soft spot and loose tongues for heartless banditry in Baringo, but this is nothing but propaganda used by political enemies to bring me down," he said.Gideon is seeking re-election on a Kanu ticket and will be up against Jubilee's Simon Chelgui in the August 8 polls.He has in the recent past criticised the national government for its slow response to bandit attacks in Baringo.Tens of people have been killed while thousands have been displaced as a result of perennial attacks in the region.Gideon's political rival DP William Ruto ordered police to shoot and kill bandits while on a visit to the region in February.Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery gazetted some parts of Baringo as dangerous, shortly before KDF was deployed to flush out the bandits.Read: Ruto under fire for shoot-to-kill order in tackling Baringo banditsAlso read: Either work with DP Ruto or shut up, Gideon Moi told
