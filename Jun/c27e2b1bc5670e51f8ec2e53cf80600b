The nurses’ strike in Kirinyaga county entered day three yesterday with healthcare services  in most public hospitals coming to a near-halt. Many patients  have opted to seek treatment in private hospitals. County medical services director Esborn Gakuo yesterday told the Star nurses in all public facilities, including the Kerugoya Referral Hospital (pictured) have withdrawn their  services. In Mwea, Karira Mission Hospital’s wards are crowded due to the large number of patients flocking to the facility. A nurse said they had to bring in extra beds. Mt Kenya and Kagio nursing homes, and Kerugoya Medical Hospital have also recorded higher numbers of patients. Lucy Nyambura, a patient who could not be treated at Kerugoya Referral, called on the government to intervene and end the nurses’ work boycott.
