Disunity and fierce rivalry among aspirants contesting same seats within NASA are threatening the opposition&rsquo;s chances of winning many seats and outdoing Jubilee in Nairobi.The aspirants, some vying as independents after losing in the primaries, have been openly displaying the bad blood among them at joint campaign rallies held by Governor Evans Kidero.During a rally in Tom Mboya Grounds in Dandora last Saturday, woman representative aspirants Rahab Ndambuki of Wiper and ODM&rsquo;s Esther Passaris almost exchanged blows on the podium.The problem started when Passaris, who spoke after Ndambuki, accused her rival of only being interested in dipping the opposition votes.&ldquo;We need to be very careful. Some people are only interested in plunging our votes and giving Jubilee an advantage,&rdquo; Passaris said.The sentiments rattled Ndambuki, and it took the intervention of Nairobi ODM chairman George Aladwa to block her from attacking Passaris. The opposition also faces a similar situation in constituency and ward levels, where candidates within the alliance are facing off.In Lang&rsquo;ata constituency, three NASA aspirants will be competing against Jubilee&rsquo;s Nixon Korir in the August 8 polls.Oscar Omoke of ODM, Daniel Odera of ANC and nominated Senator Judith Sijeny of Wiper are shooting friendly fire.In Ruaraka, the rivalry between nominated Senator Elizabeth Ongoro, now running for MP on the ANC ticket and ODM&rsquo;s Tom Kajwang has divided the opposition supporters right down the middle.The opposition alliance faces the same scenario in Embakasi North, where Jane Wangui, who was given the ODM ticket, is fighting with Fredrick Odhiambo, popularly known as Dor, for the MP seat.Chaos almost erupted during the Dandora rally when the two leaders and their supporters clashed.Dor, who is challenging Wangui&rsquo;s nomination victory in court, accused his competitor of being a Jubilee sympathiser. &ldquo;We cannot allow people who were in Jubilee to come and interfere with us in NASA. We will fight them to the end,&rdquo; Dor said.The opposition faces the same predicament in Makadara, where Aladwa and his fierce rival, former area MP Reuben Ndolo, are facing off.Ndolo is running as an independent after he lost to Aladwa in the nominations.
