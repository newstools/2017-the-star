It&rsquo;s getting colder, the sweaters are out in full force and all you want after a long day at work is something hot, filling and comforting. The term &ldquo;comfort food&rdquo; can be traced back to the 60s, when stressed adults would turn to food they associated with their childhood &ndash; their mothers&rsquo; cooking. There is something so innately comforting about your mother&rsquo;s cooking that certain foods will always take you back in time. For me, its fresh bread, thick stews and potatoes. Casseroles have always been the quintessential comfort food, and this spicy chicken and bean dish will be sure to warm you to your core.
