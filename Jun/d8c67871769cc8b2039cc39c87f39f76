The first bicameral Parliament of the multiparty era, whose term comes to an end today, will go down in history as one in which a number of brothers served in both Houses.Both the Senate and the National Assembly are expected to be adjourned sine die (indefinitely) this afternoon, but members remain legislators until others are elected in August.They can be recalled for special sittings if there is a matter of national importance, but they can also decline to pass the adjournment motion today, forcing the Houses to hold sittings routinely.Former President Daniel Moi&rsquo;s two sons were elected in the 2013 polls&mdash;on the Kanu ticket.Gideon Moi withstood the Jubilee storm in the Rift Valley to win the Baringo Senate seat, while his brother Raymond was elected MP in Rongai constituency. They are seeking reelection on the Kanu ticket.Following the post-election agreement entered into with Jubilee, Gideon became chairman of the Energy Committee in the Senate, while his brother sat in the Agriculture Committee of the National Assembly.Gideon was the more talkative of the two, both in and out of Parliament, while Raymond kept a low profile.Senate minority leader Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula (Bungoma) was elected in the 2013 general election on the Ford Kenya ticket, while his brother Timothy Wanyonyi was elected Westlands MP on the ODM ticket.They are both defending their seats on the party tickets.The two are lawyers. Just like the Mois, Wetang&rsquo;ula is the bubbly politician&mdash;very combative and a good debater&mdash;a senator Jubilee would wish to have in their fold.As the minority leader, he would take on Jubilee, scaring away any senator who attempted to interrupt him on points of order. He once asked Speaker Ekwee Ethuro to be allowed to speak for one hour uninterrupted.On the other hand, his brother has maintained a lukewarm profile. He is neither hyperactive nor quiet, but a friendly politician and among the best debaters in the House.The other pair of siblings are the Kajwang&rsquo;s. In the 2013 election, Otieno Kajwang&rsquo; was elected Homa Bay senator and his bother Tom Joseph Kajwang&rsquo; was elected Ruaraka MP.Otieno Kajwang&rsquo; died on November 18, 2014, and his younger brother Moses was elected in the February 12, 2015, by-election to replace him.Just like their friendly but combative late brother, famed for his signature fly whisk and &lsquo;Bado mapambano&rsquo; song, the two Kajwang&rsquo;s are also very combative.Moses, the IT guru, is polished in both speech and action, while TJ can easily unleash &ldquo;a friendly fire&rdquo;. Last year during President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s State of the Nation address in Parliament, he was chased out for disrupting the speech.In Narok, two sons of former paramount chief Lerionka Ntutu were elected on the URP ticket.Stephen ole Ntutu was elected senator, while his younger brother Patrick Ntutu was elected Narok West MP.Stephen maintains a low profile and can easily walk in the streets of Nairobi unnoticed. Patrick, however, is well-known in and out of Parliament.Stephen is defending his seat on the CCM ticket, while Patrick is running for governor on the same ticket.
