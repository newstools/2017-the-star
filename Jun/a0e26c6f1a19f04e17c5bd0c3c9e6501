The number of UK tourists coming to Kenya has overtaken that of US citizens by 18 per cent from January to April this year, Tourism CS Najib Balala has said.Last December, the number of US tourists grew by 16.4 per cent, compared to a four per cent decline in tourists from the UK, Balala says.The number of tourists coming to Kenya in 2016 grew by 16.1 per cent overall.He spoke in Mombasa town on Thursday during a ceremony to celebrate the 91st birthday of Queen Elizabeth organised by British High Commissioner to Kenya Nic Hailey.Balala said UK tourists have a good projection this year.So far, more than 34,000 visitors from the UK have already landed in Kenya.&ldquo;Last year, we announced that the arrival of tourists from the USA was higher than the UK, but I can assure you from January to March the UK has overtaken the USA by 18 per cent,&rdquo; Balala said.He said this was after the UK lifted its travel advisories against major towns in Kenya, including the Kenyan coastal towns of Mombasa and Lamu.&ldquo;UK understood the challenges Kenya faced when terrorists hit us. Now you [UK] understand it better when they hit Manchester, and we stand by you,&rdquo; he said.The CS said both Kenya and the UK are victims of global terrorism.In 2014, the UK issued travel advisories against the Kenyan Coast and evacuated more than 500 tourists booked in Kenyan hotels.Hailey said the UK has over the years been the source market of Kenya&rsquo;s international tourists.&ldquo;It has been my priority to promote tourism and to engage the department as much as I can to promote it,&rdquo; he added.Hailey said last year they lifted travel advisories against the Kenya Coast, therefore Lamu should now expect more British visitors.&ldquo;We are now training hundreds of security personnel in hotels and resorts along the Kenyan Coast so that we can work in partnership to promote security for tourism.&rdquo;Hailey said the recently opened British Chamber of Commerce in Mombasa has made tourism its priority.Balala said this year the ministry expects the number of tourists coming to Kenya to surpass the 20 per cent mark, despite the fact that this is an election year. &ldquo;Our hotels are fully booked up to the end of July. We expect the number to go down in election week, but we shall pick up again.&rdquo;
