It's Uhuru Kenyatta who is on the ballot,&rdquo; Musalia told the press in Nairobi on Thursday.The state-funded Kenya National Commission on Human Rights had protested that Uhuru's alleged use of state resources and claimed some of his moves amounted to voter bribery.NASA said the IEBC does not need prompting to penalise the President for using the Presidential Delivery Portal to advertise Jubilee messages.The coalition insisted that the DCI, DPP and IEBC are aware of the violations by Uhuru and his men but are quiet in a strategic move to defraud citizens, free, fair and credible polls.They gave the example of Uhuru dishing out cheques to IDPs, clad in Jubilee colours.Read: Kisii MPs question source of money Uhuru is 'dishing out' to IDPsAlso see: [VIDEO] Never again, Uhuru says as state pays Nyamira IDPs Sh470 millionSiaya Senator James Orengo said nothing bars the DPP from launching a probe against Uhuru saying under the Election Act, Uhuru is a candidate like the rest.&ldquo;Kenyans should abandon this notion that the President is above the law.
