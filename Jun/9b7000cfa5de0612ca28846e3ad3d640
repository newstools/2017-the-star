The China Trade Week 2017 is a highly anticipated a 3-day trade show being held from 29th June to the 1st July 2017 at the Kenya International Conference Centre in Nairobi, Kenya. It promises to be bigger and better than before, with over 500 quality Chinese manufacturers showcasing thousands of products across a spectrum of industries.After an amazing opening event last year, the company was thrilled with the response received from Kenyans.More on this: China Trade Week Comes To TownThis was their first event in the country and they had expected about 3,000 visitors. However, they received over 16,500 visitors. It proved that this platform was indeed important and was required to bring together high-end Chinese manufacturers from China and business owners and entrepreneurs from Kenya.SME's wanted to purchase high volumes of products from China but didn't want to risk doing business with faceless companies online, or didn't have the time or funds to travel to China.China Trade Week 2016 brought 150 certified manufacturers to Kenya to connect the business community of both countries. The feedback received last year was highly positive, as many exhibitors secured business prospects or left with the intention of setting up a local office.After last year's feedback, the concentration is now on 3 halls; building materials and energy in hall 1, and hall 2 dedicated to the lighting industry. In hall 3, they have something for everyone including auto parts, textiles, agriculture &amp; machinery and of course electronics.This year the event will have more than twice the number of exhibitors and is anticipating a similar increase in visitor numbersThere will also be seminars taking place in hall 1 giving experience and advice on how to practically and safely source products from China.China Sourcing Forum Workshop At The China Trade Week 2016.
