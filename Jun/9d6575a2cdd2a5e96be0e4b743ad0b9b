Residents of Kirinyaga county are not amused with the barbs the two frontrunners for governor are trading. They have asked JP's Anne Waiguru and Narc Kenya's Martha Karua to stop with the name-calling and address pertinent issues. Waiguru has made Karua's age the focus of her campaign. Campaigning in Mutira ward, Kirinyaga Central constituency, Waiguru said Karua is old, hence not fit to be governor. Karua, on the other hand, is using the Sh1.6 billion NYS scandal that happened under Waiguru's watch at the Devolution ministry. '' I have been tried and tested. When I served for four terms as Gichugu MP I did not mismanage or steal a single penny. [But] we have a competitor whose other name is corruption, don't vote for her,'' Karua told a crowd at South Ngariama on Tuesday.Munene Nyaga, the running mate of Maendeleo Chap Chap governor candidate Macharia Karani, told the Star the two need to sell their manifestos and agenda to voters instead of exchanging insults.
