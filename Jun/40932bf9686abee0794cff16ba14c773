Kitui Senator David Musila claims comments that he supports President Uhuru Kenyatta's re-election have been taken out of context.During a rally on Sunday, the Senator asked youths to support the President on the basis of his record."Vote for me as an independent candidate, elect Uhuru without minding his party," Musila said as he campaigned with Kitui West MP Francis Nyenze.But on Monday, Musila said he was misquoted by "unknown forces"."I did not endorse Uhuru and in fact, I did not endorse anyone. I have made it very clear that I am an independent candidate...I am not supporting Jubilee or anyone," he said during an interview on Citizen TV."I made it clear that anyone can be re-elected. That is where I mentioned that even Uhuru or NASA leader Raila Odinga can be elected. Someone is editing all this."He said he does not support any candidate ahead of the elections but noted that NASA should not reject the independent candidates.Raila rallied his supporters to reject independents at the ballot saying the party needed numerical strength in both Houses of Parliament.Read: Don't vote for independent candidates, Raila tells NASA supporters"Usually I would support Jubilee Party...I mean NASA....because people know NASA here," Musila added.He and Nyenze have become increasingly critical of Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka.Musila ditched Wiper party after he was floored in the Kitui governor's race.
