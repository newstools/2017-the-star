Mombasa governor aspirant Chitavi Mkalla has been barred from contesting in the next elections on integrity grounds. Chitavi (United Democratic Party) was barred for allegedly flouted tendering procedures at the Mombasa water and sewerage company in 2007/8 in the award of medical insurance cover tender.IEBC had cleared Chitavi at 4 pm on Friday but later cancelled the certificate at 9 pm after recommendation by EACC.He was found culpable and was charged a fine of sh800,000 or be jailed for three years.Chitavi, however, said he appealed the case and is ongoing, meaning that the electoral commission has no grounds to bar him."I paid the fine but the High Court refunded the money after my appeal. I was wrongfully convicted that is why the case is ongoing," he said."This is not about the case. It's about some people hiding in masks trying to detract me but this will not stop Chitavi in my race to be Mombasa governor," he stated.Other aspirants for the seat are the incumbent Hassan Joho, Nyali MP Hezron Awiti, and Suleiman Shahbal.The governor hopeful is among the list of 106 candidates who are mentioned in the list given to IEBC by EACC on integrity issues.Other leaders in the EACC list all with integrity issues and the status of their cases include Muranga Governor Mwangi wa Iria, Okoth Obado (Migori), ALfAlfredtua (Machakos), Evans Kidero (Nairobi), Chris Obure (Kisii), Mike Sonko (Nairobi senator), Anne Waiguru (Kirinyaga governor candidate) among others.Also read; Mombasa governor race &lsquo;will pit the rich against the poor&rsquo;
