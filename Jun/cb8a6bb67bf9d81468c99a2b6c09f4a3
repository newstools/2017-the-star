Kitui Central MP aspirant Moses Banda has protested to the IEBC that NASA supporters on Tuesday attempted to cause violence at a Jubilee rally in Kitui town.Banda, running on the Jubilee ticket, yesterday said &ldquo;hirelings&rdquo; heckled and shouted &ldquo;NASA&rdquo; and &ldquo;unga&rdquo; as speakers addressed residents in Kalundu.&ldquo;I condemn the group that was paid to try and disrupt the meeting. It is definitely a violation of the electoral laws. I have registered the complaint with the electoral agency,&rdquo; Banda said in a statement to the media.He said, however, he was pleased that many people turned up for the Jubilee meeting.Banda said it was proof Kitui Central is no longer an opposition stronghold, but a battleground.On Tuesday evening, a Jubilee campaign caravan led by former Cabinet minister Amos Kimunya was heckled as the meeting was underway in Kitui town.The Jubilee leaders had difficulties addressing the meeting as their voices were drowned out by jeers and pro-NASA chants.Some leaders pleaded with the crowd to stop shouting.The Jubilee politicians included Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria, nominated MP Johnson Sakaja, Joe Mutambu (MP Mwingi Central) and Rachel Nyamai (MP Kitui south).Others trying to popularise Jubilee in Wiper leader&rsquo;s Kalonzo Musyoka&rsquo;s home county were aspirants Mwende Mwinzi (Mwingi West MP), Moses Banda (Kitui Central MP) and Ben Mbai (Kitui West MP).Mwinzi told those who tried to disrupt the meeting to show respect for other politicians.Kimunya said, &ldquo;Unga will be availed and it will be sold at the affordable price of Sh90 per packet.&rdquo; He urged Kitui residents to reelect President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto.
