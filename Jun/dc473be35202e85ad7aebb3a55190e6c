Embakasi Queens women&rsquo;s team will be seeking their second win of the season when they tackle National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) in the ongoing Kenya Handball Federation (KHF) national league at the weekend. Queens won their first match against National Youth Service 45-15 and the team coach Emmanuel Kieti is confident they will extend their form this weekend.Kieti said they have what it takes to challenge for the titles. &ldquo;The win against NYS gave us the morale ahead of the Saturday clash. NCPB are an experienced side but we have watched them in their previous seasons and we know what to do,&rdquo; he said. He added: &ldquo;We are currently working on our back court defence which was wanting during the clash against NYS and so far, so good. &rdquo;At the same time, Queens have acquired the service left back Elizabeth Mutua from Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology. Kieti said the player was instrumental and impressive for her side during the &lsquo;Just Be Master&rsquo; tournament last month in Kakamega, hence the reason why they have signed her.
