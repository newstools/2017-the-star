Ali Mbogo of Wiper has been cleared by the IEBC to run for Kisauni MP. He will face incumbent Rashid Bedzimba, a Hassan Joho ally.Bedzimba (ODM) got a direct ticket after Mbogo ditched the party for the Kalonzo Musyoka-led outfit, citing foul play.Bedzimba, a former GSU officer, is banking on his achievements and Joho&rsquo;s popularity to win.But besides his initiatives in the education sector, Mbogo (pictured) is counting on his closeness with NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga to gain ODM backing. He is also relying on Kalonzo&rsquo;s clout to reach out to the Kamba voters &mdash; the second largest non-native vote bloc in the constituency.Just like Bedzimba, Mbogo is a Mijikenda, the largest vote bloc in Kisauni and the entire Mombasa county.
