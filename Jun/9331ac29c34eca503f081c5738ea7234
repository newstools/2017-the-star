JP&rsquo;s Garissa Township candidate Aden Duale tore into Wiper&rsquo;s Farah Maalim soon after the IEBC cleared him to run.Duale on Friday said Maalim wrote his political obituary the moment he decided to face him at the ballot. He was addressing a rally in Garissa town.&ldquo;My politics and that of Farah is like day and night. Watch this space. A 10-foot grave awaits Farah&rsquo;s political career come August 9. This is the last time you will hear of him in the political arena,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;This man was misadvised big time because he is used to clan politics, but forgets that, in Garissa Township, it is a different ball game all together because it&rsquo;s home to all Kenyans. He only enjoys the support of a paltry 5,000 voters, while the rest &mdash; 54,000 &mdash; belong to me.&rdquo;Duale said he has a 10-point scorecard to present to residents during his campaigns &mdash; including uniting communities, connection of households to the national power grid and road tarmacking.The National Assembly Majority leader dismissed the stepping down of ODM nominee Abdinasir Dolal in favour of Maalim as inconsequential.&ldquo;The trend could have been different if Dolal come from my clan. Farah and Dolal comes from the same clan and they could have shared the same votes from the same basket. For me, it doesn&rsquo;t make any difference,&rdquo; he said.Duale is an Abduwak, while Maalim is an Ahuliyan. Maalim on Thursday said he has set his eyes on the prize and expressed confidence that he will defeat Duale, adding that residents are yearning for positive change.&ldquo;It is not only about changing the MP, but also the way business and politics has been transacted for the past 10 years,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not the kind of politician who responds to such statements. All I can tell him is: &lsquo;Bring it on!&rsquo;. Let the people decide. All he is saying against me is hot air and he better start thinking of what he&rsquo;ll do for the next five years he will be out in the cold.&rdquo;Maalim said his team has put in place measures to ensure he is not rigged out this time round. Duale dismissed claims that he plans to rig.ANC&rsquo;s Abdi Yarre is also in the race.
