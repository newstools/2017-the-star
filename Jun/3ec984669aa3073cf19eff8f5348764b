Little, the upstart taxi-hailing firm owned by Nairobi-based software firm Craft Silicon, has expanded its services to the lakeside city of Kisumu and surrounding towns.The app, powered by Safaricom, was launched in Nairobi on July 5 last year to counter the then rising popularity of the US-owned Uber which started operations in Nairobi in January 2015.The Kisumu services adds to Mombasa where the ride-hailing app went live last October.Craft Silicon said in a statement yesterday plans to spread its wings to Nakuru and Eldoret by end of the year. &ldquo;Despite operating in a highly competitive environment, we have had a steady growth of the service. Our expansion plan has been driven by demand from customers and we wish to see other regions in Kenya enjoy Little,&rdquo; Craft Silicon chairman Kamal Budhabhatti said. &ldquo;We are also pleased to announce that for the next three months customers in Kisumu will enjoy discounted rides of Sh25 per kilometre.&rdquo; Little charges Sh30 per kilometre for a basic ride, which rises on comfort preference, with minimum fare at Sh190. Uber, on the other hand, charges a uniform Sh42 per kilometre with minimum fare at Sh300. Taxify charges the least cost at Sh26 per kilometre with no minimum fare, while MondoRide charges Sh30 per kilometre with a minimum fare of Sh200. Craft Silicon said about 140,000 users have downloaded the app, with more than 4,000 drivers signed up. &ldquo;Little has also signed up 140 corporates with another 80 expected to be come on board in the next six months,&rdquo; the firm said said.
