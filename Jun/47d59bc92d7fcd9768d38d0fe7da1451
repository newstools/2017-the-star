Kitutu Masaba MP Timothy Bosire has vowed to teach Jubilee Party a lesson in Nyamira by delivering all seats for NASA on August 8. The ODM national treasurer said it is ridiculous that Jubilee, through its agents, has been dishing out money to hoodwink voters ahead of the polls. "There is no Jubilee in Nyamira. It is of grave concern that those from this region who are working in government have been crisscrossing the county bribing voters." The MP singled out Social Protection PS Susan Mochache, who hails from the region, as being part of government officers dishing out money. "It is immoral for senior government officials and lawyers who come from this area to just walk around giving out money to influence voters," Bosire said. However, when reached for comment, Mochache denied the MP's claims asking the legislator to produce evidence to back the claims. "Neither Jubilee nor I can do that. He needs to adduce evidence if any," she said. Bosire, a vicious critic of the Jubilee administration, said he is determined to ensure NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga wins a majority of the seats in Nyamira. "We have a clear strategy on how we will achieve this. That is not for public consumption but mark my words,we will sweep all the seats." Regarding county politics, Bosire said since he is in the presidential campaign, he may not express his views on who to back for the county's key seats. Various aspirants including governor aspirants have been seeking his endorsement ahead of the polls, but the vocal lawmaker has been strategic. "I have strong views about county politics, which I have explained before and can express them again," the MP said. Read: Nyagarama gets ticket to defend seat
