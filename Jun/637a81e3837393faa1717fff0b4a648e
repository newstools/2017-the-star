President Uhuru Kenyatta has told the Luhyas to stop wasting time in the Opposition because &ldquo;NASA can never beat Jubilee&rdquo;.He spoke during a series of rallies in Naitiri, Kamukuywa and Bungoma town. &ldquo;We are urging you to come so that we can walk together. That side you voted for last time will forever remain the loyal opposition,&rdquo; Uhuru said. He chided NASA principal and Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula that he is aware NASA is going to lose in the election and that is why he is defending his seat.&ldquo;These guys know they can&rsquo;t beat us. That&rsquo;s why your senator has decided to defend his seat,&rdquo; Uhuru said. He laughed off NASA strategies, saying they are repeating the mistake of using the tribal card. Uhuru said the Jubilee administration has initiated many projects, but the Opposition has resorted to spreading propaganda against it to &ldquo;confuse&rdquo; the people of Western.Deputy President William Ruto said they went to Bungoma to prove the Opposition wrong that it was &ldquo;its zone&rdquo;.
