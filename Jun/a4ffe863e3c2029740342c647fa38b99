Stone miners from quarries in Kaimbaga, Kariamu, Ndemi and Captain, Nyandarua county, on Monday boycotted work to protest against exploitation and oppression by the quarry owners.The 400 workers converged at Ndemi shopping centre, where they held a protest match, before holding a meeting to come up with ways to stop their bosses exploiting them.They said on March 28 they reached an agreement with quarry owners that the price of each stone cut will be Sh17 for 5x9 pieces, Sh18 for 6x9 and Sh20 for 9x9 pieces, but the bosses have reduced this prices by Sh2.They said their lives have stagnated due to exploitation coupled with the high cost of living, while the rest of the country is progressing. They said they cannot dress well, feed or take their children to good schools.&ldquo;We therefore decided to protest to demand that the prices be reinstated,&rdquo; miners chairman Andrea Amoke said.
