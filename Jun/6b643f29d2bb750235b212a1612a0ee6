The High Court has temporarily suspended amendments recently made to the Retirement Benefits Regulations.Justice John Mativo, in a ruling, said amendments that become effective yesterday will be suspended until a petition filed by activist Okiya Omtatah is heard. The activist filed an urgent application at the Milimani law courts, accusing Treasury PS Henry Rotich of sneaking in amendments to the regulations without subjecting it to public participation. Omtatah is aggrieved by the decision of the ministry to make several changes to the regulations.They include a requirement that all existing scheme to reapply for registration using Form One, yet the Draft Regulations did not have such a provision.Omtatah also says the regulations require every umbrella scheme to have written rules providing for conditions for an employer ceasing to make contributions, which is not in the draft regulations. &ldquo;The new regulations give qualification of top directors and top management of a sponsor yet the draft had no explicit requirements.&rdquo;He says unlike before, the regulations now provide more specificity on restrictions by including grade, cadre, age, differences in salary, wages, rank, seniority at the workplace, association.The new regulations provide that a member shall not withdraw membership or benefits unless he demonstrates need related to personal aptitude for which the trustees have given approval and obtained prior written consent from the Authority.Omtatah says making such changes without involving the public is unconstitutional. The activist says the provisions introduced by the ministry have far-reaching implications on the industry and the public and cannot be sneaked into law at the last minute, hidden away as though they were miscellaneous editorial issues.His contention is that the failure to subject the provisions to public participation is contrary to the Constitution. In addition, the activist told the court in keeping with the practice of making statutory instruments, the said provisions ought to have been included in the draft regulations.&ldquo;The reason why the law requires public participation is to provide for transparency in the enactment of policy, by notifying Kenyans in advance of proposed changes in policy and affording them the opportunity to participate,&rdquo; he said. The case will come up on July 10 for further direction.
