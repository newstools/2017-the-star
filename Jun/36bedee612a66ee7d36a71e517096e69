Public servants who participate in political campaign rallies need to draw the line at actually politicking and endorsing one side against the other.After all, the work of government is paid for by the taxpayers of all political persuasions.What&rsquo;s more, the law changed and the Constitution disbars Cabinet Secretaries, Principal Secretaries and other State officers from the rough and tumble of politics.It is one thing for a Cabinet Secretary to say that he or she is demonstrating their ministry&rsquo;s work and achievements, but quite another to wear party caps and T-shirts and endorse a candidate and a party.With the exception of the President and Deputy President, CSs and PSs are not active politicians.Granted they work for the incumbent administration, but they need to pick the forums at which they offer political support carefully, in order so as not to offend those who are not likeminded.It should also be made clear that their personal political rights are not being suspended or otherwise thwarted.
