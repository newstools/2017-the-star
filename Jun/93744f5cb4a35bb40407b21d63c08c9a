He accused individuals close to Raila of initiating legal proceedings contesting his nomination to settle political scores. He named Dennis Onyango, Raila&rsquo;s aide, and lawyer Kennedy Okong&rsquo;o, of launching a malicious campaign aimed at discrediting his nomination &ldquo;with instructions from a senior woman member of the Jaramogi family&rdquo;. Onyango and Okong&rsquo;o have denied being behind the plot. &ldquo;Okong&rsquo;o is a guy I have known to be my political enemy for many years. Today he is the ODM lawyer filing a case against me,&rdquo; Anyanga said.
