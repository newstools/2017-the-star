Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital nurses have asked President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto to suspend their reelection campaigns and intervene in the ongoing strike. The hospital&rsquo;s union chairman, Kennedy Orangi, said the buck stops with the two because only they can end the boycott like they did with the doctors&rsquo; strike in March.&ldquo;Patients are suffering over the CBA dispute that can be sorted out in a few hours,&rdquo; Orangi said. He said the hospital has no choice but to use medical students to handle patients, which is not allowed. &ldquo;The strike has affected services at the hospital terribly,&rdquo; Orangi said. He said they have advised patients not to seek treatment at the facility because the services being offered are below the required standards.More than 1,000 nurses from the hospital have joined their colleagues in a countrywide strike. They are demanding that their delayed CBA be implemented for them to go back to work.Orangi says the Salaries and Remuneration Commission is to blame for the stalemate that has led to the three-week strike. &ldquo;We are asking Sarah Serem to please do her work as required, instead of frustrating workers in the country,&rdquo; he said.The hospital management has suspended negotiations with the nurses&rsquo; union. &ldquo;We have nothing going on, and we cannot go on with talks because the SRC is not responding to our demands. The SRC has to write a letter that allows implementation of what we agreed on in the CBA,&rdquo; Orangi said. The hospital&rsquo;s CEO, Dr Wilson Aruasa, says they are waiting for the SRC&rsquo;s input. Orangi says they do not recognise a faction of the union led by embattled Kenya National Union of Nurses national chairman John Bii, and they will only take orders from secretary general Seth Panyako. The new CBA the striking nurses are fighting for will cost the county governments and the National Treasury more than Sh40 billion to implement.
