Funyula MP Paul Otuoma's uncle will not back him in the race to succeed Governor Sospeter Ojaamong.Mzee Ofafa Ojasi has said he will campaign for Ojaamong to get more than 20,000 votes in the constituency.He spoke on Wednesday during a thanksgiving ceremony by Busia Speaker Bernard Wamalwa at his Bukiri home.Ojasi and Wamalwa, who is also Otuoma's close relative, said they will not support him as he did not consult the family."I am Otuoma's father...Wamalwa and I led him into politics. I am not afraid to say he will fall like Sigiri bridge," the uncle said."I asked my son which formula he will use to win the elections but he did not have an answer. Butula, which was his stronghold, has also fallen."The Sh1.2 billion, 25m bridge on River Nzioa, that links Bunyala North and South, collapsed on Monday morning, leaving more than 28 workers injured.President Uhuru Kenyatta inspected work on the bridge when he and Deputy President William Ruto visited Budalang'i on June 14.Read: Come carry your collapsed Sigiri bridge, Ababu tells RailaOjasi further said the MP disobeyed him when he asked that he wait until 2022 to vie for governor.Wamwalwa added: "This time he took a unilateral decision without consulting family members and constituents."The two praised Ojaamong, who attended the function with his wife Judy, saying he has done a lot for the Samia community. Eleven of the county's 53 MCAs are from the sub-county.Wamwalwa said propaganda by 'Team Otuoma' that NASA flag bearer Raila Odinga did not endorse Ojaamong during his recent tour to the county was a figment of their imagination."When Raila said Ojaamong will make the killer pass for him to score, what did he mean? he asked.The Governor thanked the people of Funyula for delivering him 7,000 votes during the nominations and hoped they will triple the number on August 8."He pledged to work with Wamalwa."I am determined to revive Mulwanda ginnery despite too much politics," he said, adding his government has started distributing bursary cheques.Nangina MCA John Obwogo said Otuoma is his mentor in politics but will not get his support. He added he will not bow to threats while seeking votes for Raila and Ojaamong.More on this: "No Otuoma!
