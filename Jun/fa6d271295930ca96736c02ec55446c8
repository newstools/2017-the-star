Former Rangwe MP Shem Ochuodho wants the IEBC to allow him to present his papers for clearance to run for Homa Bay senator. He was barred from presenting his papers to the commission because he was behind schedule. Ochuodho wants the decision reversed. In an affidavit filed before the High Court in Nairobi, he argued that barring him from the contest would undermine residents’ ability to elect a senator of their choice. “The people of Homa Bay county would be denied the opportunity to elect the senator of their choice,” the affidavit reads. Ochuodho (pictured) also wants the court to compel county IEBC returning officer Michael Kosgei to allow him to make cash payment when submitting his nomination papers due to the short notice he received.
