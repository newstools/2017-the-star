Murang&rsquo;a MCAs want the county government to organise annual investors&rsquo; conferences to showcase investment opportunities available in the region.In a motion tabled by nominated MCA Rebbecca Mwichigi, and which was unanimously passed, the MCAs said the county is full of investment opportunities that remain unexploited.She said the government should allocate money to organise the investment forums every year from this year moving forward.In her motion, Mwichigi also wants the county government to establish an investment desk that will be charged with the responsibility of disseminating information on the investment opportunities available to potential investors.The MCA said the desk will be fully facilitated by the county government to market the county.&ldquo;This office will also be properly equipped with personnel and machinery to map out the available resources and do everything possible to attract investors,&rdquo; Mwichigi said.She said in the last four years, the county government has not done much to attract investors to enable the county's economy to grow.Mwichigi asked the county government to come up with an investment incentive policy that will lure traders to set up industries in the county.&ldquo;Our county is endowed with the Aberdare Range, winding rivers with waterfalls, rich agricultural soils and beautiful hills yet to be exploited,&rdquo; she said.The MCA said these resources have the capacity to provide many job opportunities and create wealth, if the county is able to attract investors.&ldquo;The quality and quantity of our coffee and tea remains undocumented even though they are famed to be the best worldwide. Farmers would make more money if we were able to convince investors to buy directly from them through cooperatives,&rdquo; she said.Nominated MCA Jimmy Kagoni, who supported the motion, said most countries attract investors through incentives.&ldquo;The county government should consider offering investors free water and power connection to their industries,&rdquo; he said.Kagoni said the government should also consider organizing pilgrimage for members of the Kikuyu community to the Mukurwe wa Nyagathanga shrine, believed to be its origin.The MCA said foreigners get shocked at the many unexploited employment opportunities that can help the government rake in a lot of revenue.Muthithi MCA Samuel Dishon asked the county government to show goodwill in organising the investors&rsquo; conference.He accused the county government of failing to implement motions passed by the county assembly.
