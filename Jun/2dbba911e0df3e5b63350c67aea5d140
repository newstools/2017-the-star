Rich kid of Instagram Robert Omwenga Momanyi, commonly referred to as Makadara 001, was cleared by the IEBC on Friday.The young lad is vying for the Makadara parliamentary seat on a Jubilee ticket after thrashing his opponents in the recent party nominations. He got a direct nomination under the Jubilee coalition.Momanyi, who is known for his flashy lifestyle and has been branded &lsquo;Sonko&rsquo; by his supporters, is the only rich kid who made it to this stage after his counterparts, the likes of Fred Gumo&rsquo;s son and Ben Gatu, were beaten in party nominations, and Rosemary Odinga pulled out of the race after she became sick.The aspirant, who is hopeful that come August 8 he will beat former mayor George Aladwa (Cord), has promised to bring change to Makadara constituency.Momanyi believes it&rsquo;s time for the youth to rule, and he says this is just the beginning and he will continue vying for higher positions during the coming elections.&ldquo;Running as a candidate of the youth and for change in Makadara. Poor roads, rise In insecurity, unemployment, no funds for women groups, poor management by CDF, nepotism, old guards who did nothing in the past have nothing to offer. I support Jubilee for they have empowered the youths and have delivered a lot of development projects as a government. Furthermore, Jubilee has youthful leaders like Sonko who will be the next governor of Nairobi,&rdquo; Momanyi said.Makadara residents are happy with Momanyi, and we hope they will translate the love into votes come August.Reactions include:Masha: Let&rsquo;s give this young brother of mine a chance to steer us forward. Makadara let&rsquo;s vote Robert Birdman OmwengaKen: It&rsquo;s time for the old politicians to go back to the village and continue from where they left off. It&rsquo;s time for the youth to prove that indeed we can do it. Congratulations.
