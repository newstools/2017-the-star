Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula has praised the NASA brigade for a successful tour of Western as thousands of people turned up for the rallies.The coalition leaders led by presidential candidate Raila Odinga held campaign rallies in Trans Nzoia, Bungoma, Vihiga and Busia counties last week.Speaking to the press in Kaburengu on Monday, Wetang'ula said all Kenyans have seen how thousands turned out in large numbers to support NASA and urging the team to redeem Kenya from miseries that the Jubilee regime has plunged them into."It was also a true testimony to the Jubilee team that no matter how many trips Uhuru and Ruto have made and will make in Western, they will not get any votes as our people are fully in NASA; and [they] can't wait to send Jubilee home for having shown Kenyans how not to rule a country," he said."Our focus now as NASA is on Wednesday evening as we will congregate in Nairobi to unveil our manifestos and dreams that is going to make Kenya great again; the dream that is going to eradicate poverty, bring money back to the pockets of Kenyans; and a dream that is going to eliminate corruption, nepotism and tribalism, which have highly affected the living standards of wananchi."The senator said Jubilee has wronged taxpayers by reversing the gains Kenya achieved since Independence.He said Jubilee has not honoured its manifesto and there is no need for them coming up with another one.Jubilee launched its manifesto in Nairobi on Monday evening."I saw Prof Munene Muchemi the other night on national television trying to justify the unjustifiable Jubilee manifesto. In fact, he looked like a poor actor in a poor play because he was unable to explain at all what Jubilee has done, what it can promise and what it promised in its manifesto of 2013," Wetang'ula said."They promised this country many things and hoodwinked Kenyans to think that they were a youthful leadership that would bring change to Kenyan, but little did Kenyans know they were up to tricks. But they now know that it was a hoax that was meant to galvanise people to vote for them and now Kenyans know they are a monumental fraud visited on them."The Ford Kenya party boss said that Jubilee promised to build five brand new modern stadiums and give laptops to every standard one pupil, but has not done so."You promised 500,000 jobs, where are they? You said placards of 'hakuna kazi' (there's no work) will be replaced with 'kuna kazi' (there's work), but there is nothing," Wetang'ula said."The youths of this country are suffering and are yearning for real change that will better their lives and we in NASA promise that we are going to demonstrate to Kenyans how to make our diversity honoured."Every dream they gave to Mulembe has become a nightmare with no hope."Wetang'ula said Jubilee promised to revive teh Webuye Pan Paper Mills, but they robbed it and bought it at a price not acceptable to Western residents."Jubilee promised to revive Mumias that is virtually dead. They send money to it and go back and claim it. Nzoia is now on its deathbed. Last week, they sent Sh300 million of the Sugar Development Levy and we have information that Jubilee players in Bungoma, led by [Bungoma Governor Kenneth] Lusaka, are salivating for that money to put in Jubilee campaigns. We are cautioning them not to dare go that way at all."Kenyans are now wise and I besiege you to believe in NASA because we have servant leadership, colossal leadership and consultative and patriotism that will carry the young the old, middle aged disabled and we wont be a government of two people and two communities but a face of Kenya," he added.Wetang'ula was with Bungoma women rep aspirant Catherine Wambilianga (Ford Kenya) and Webuye West Ford Kenya party members.
