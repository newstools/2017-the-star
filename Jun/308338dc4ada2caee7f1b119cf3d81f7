The Citizen&rsquo;s Convention Party leader, Grace Akumu (pictured), has opposed the six-piece vote campaign by NASA presidential flagbearer Raila Odinga.She asked Raila to embrace small parties and independent candidates as they are crucial for his presidency. Akumu said the six-piece pattern campaign denies the electorate the opportunity to elect right leaders who are development-oriented. On Tuesday, after being cleared by the IEBC to contest for the Kisumu woman rep seat, Akumu urged the opposition chiefs not to marginalise smaller political parties and independent candidates. Akumu said her party did not field a presidential candidate as she fully supports Raila&rsquo;s bid.
