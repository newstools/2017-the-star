The Jubilee national office is yet to provide campaign materials to aspirants in Kisumu. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s 51 days to the general election and we have fielded over 200 candidates in Kisumu, Homa Bay, Siaya and Migori, but we still lack campaign materials,&rdquo; county secretary Steve Biko said.He asked for posters, banners, flyers, and Jubilee-branded T-shirts and lesos to publicise President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s campaign.Biko spoke in Kisumu town on Saturday. &ldquo;The response from the national office officials has not been positive [otherwise] we would have not been here appealing to the President to intervene,&rdquo; he said.Biko said they are ready to go out and get the votes. He said for some time now the aspirants have been doing it alone but they now need the support of the national office.&ldquo;We have had a great reception on the ground and this momentum must continue, hence we want the head office, through national secretary general Raphael Tuju, to work on this as soon as possible,&rdquo; he said. Biko praised JP for waiving fees, enabling them to field more candidates.
