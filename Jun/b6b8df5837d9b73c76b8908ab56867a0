The owner of the residential building that collapsed on Tuesday morning and killed two people in the Kware Pipeline area of Embakasi is still at large.Governor Evans Kidero said police and the county inspectorate officers are still looking for the landlord.&ldquo;We had asked him to come to City Hall with his building papers to help us in the rescue operations but he failed. Now he is a criminal and the police are after him,&rdquo; Kidero said.The governor said 126 of the 128 tenants of the six-storey building have been resettled. It was built in 2007 but the county says it did not approve the works.The building is among the houses the county administration and the National Construction Authority had earmarked for demolition.On Tuesday, Building Inspectorate secretary Moses Nyakiongora said more than 5,000 houses have been audited by a multi-sectoral team, and 640 were found to be unsafe for occupation. Only 34 of the unfit buildings have been brought down in the last one year.&ldquo;The exercise [demolition] has been slowed by court orders and we are asking the courts to stop issuing orders that jeopardise the lives of our people,&rdquo; Kidero said.He ordered the owner of the eight-storey building next to the collapsed one to bring it down in seven days.The governor addressed the media after attending interfaith peace prayers at the Visa Oshwal temple. The prayers were called by the Sikh Council of Kenya.Meanwhile, Kidero has told the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to ensure transparency in the polls, and involve all players in its activities. He called for the controversy surrounding the award of a Sh2.5 billion ballot printing tender to be cleared.
