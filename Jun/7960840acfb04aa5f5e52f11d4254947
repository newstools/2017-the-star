NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga does not deserve to lead this country as he presided over corruption when he was Prime Minister, a former Industrialisation assistant minister has said. Speaking on Wednesday, Nderitu Muriithi, Laikipia West MP,  said Raila protected ministers from ODM  in the grand coalition government. Muriithi, was addressing residents during a series of meetings in Laikipia Central. He is running for Laikipia governor as an independent but is campaigning for President Uhuru Kenyatta’s reelection.  He accused former Tinderet MP Henry Kosgey of siphoning money from public coffers when he was his boss in the ministry. “I would go to his [Raila’s] office and tell him that Henry was stealing government money but his response was: ‘yes, I will act’, but did nothing. Is that the person you want to entrust the country with?” Muriithi  said at Shallom IDP camp.
