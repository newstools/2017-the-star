President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday said constitutional amendments that NASA wants done to accommodate its co-principals in government leadership will cost Sh20 billion.Uhuru said this is quite a huge sum of money to be used to create offices for only three people to lead the country.Instead, the money should be used to initiate other projects to create more jobs for youths.Under the arrangement, ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi is proposed to take up a position that will be created after the election, and only in the event of victory, known as Premier Cabinet Secretary. The proposed position is touted to be influential, in charge of government coordination and supervision of all ministries.The Premier Cabinet Secretary, equivalent to a chief minister, according to sources, will have the added portfolio of Internal Security and Administration of National Government.The Constitution does not provide for this position.Under the Premier CS will be two powerful deputies of equal rank. One will oversee the State Department of Public Service and the other will be in charge of the State Department of Devolution and Planning.Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto&rsquo;s Chama Cha Mashinani will be allocated one of the two deputies to head the Devolution wing.The other deputy in charge of Public Service will go to Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula&rsquo;s Ford Kenya party.The State Department of Public Service will also oversee Foreign Affairs and International Relations.The Deputy Premier in charge of Devolution and Planning is also proposed to be in charge of the powerful Finance and Planning ministry.The president, who spoke at Kiritiri Town in Mbeere South during a campaign tour, asked the voters to reject the NASA leaders.He said they have no interest of Kenyans at heart but to achieve selfish interests. &ldquo;Do Kenyans have Sh20 billion to carry out another referendum? Isn&rsquo;t it better for us to use the cash in projects that can assist our youth to get employment?&rdquo; Uhuru said.He said such a huge amount of money should not be used to create employment for only four people.The money, the President added, can be used to complete crucial projects started by Jubilee.Uhuru said opposition leader Raila Odinga is playing about with the minds of Kenyans and asked citizens not to allow him to do so by reelecting him. He told Embu residents if reelected, Jubilee will improve the miraa market and open up markets.
