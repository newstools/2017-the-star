The handling of the cholera outbreak at the Weston Hotel, Nairobi, has been less than transparent. Fifty people, the majority of them delegates attending a medical/scientific conference, contracted cholera last week (see Page 2).The Nairobi county government yesterday announced that the outcome of an official probe will be made public this week.Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero has said that the medical records of the Weston&rsquo;s staffers will be checked.Initially there was equivocation as regards what the disease actually was. But culture tests from the National Public Health Laboratories showed that 18 of 25 samples returned positive results for cholera. The medics who were sickened surely know all the symptoms of cholera.Disease knows no borders, whoever the proprietor of an outbreak premises might happen to be.The source of the cholera must be traced. All staff, particularly in the kitchen, should have been speedily quarantined. Kenyans should be told by week&rsquo;s end what the source was &ndash; particularly whether unhygienic staff and supplies.Above all, there should be no politicization of this issue.
