Siaya ODM members have condemned chaos at the party’s rally in Rarieda on Monday. Supporters of Nicholas Gumbo, running for governor as an independent, clashed with those of ODM’ Governor Cornel Rasanga. This interrupted the rally of NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga. Alego Usonga ODM chairman Orwenjo Umidha wants Gumbo to apologise, saying his supporters were rude to Raila. On Tuesday, Gumbo distanced himself from the chaos, saying he had nothing to do with it. Orwenjo warned independents against using youths to cause violence. “Our youths are supposed to be empowered, not taken for granted to cause violence during campaigns,” he said. Orwenjo was accompanied by Siaya Township ODM MCA candidate Sam Hawala and ODM youth representative Alfayo Abuje. They urged peace.
