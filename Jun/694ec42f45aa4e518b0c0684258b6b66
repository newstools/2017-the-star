IS the IEBC plotting a shocker for candidates already cleared to run in the August 8 General Election? The electoral agency, which is seeking to force compliance with the Constitution's Chapter Six on Integrity and Leadership, is said to be considering recalling clearance certificates issued to culpable candidates. A little bird whispers to Corridors that it is not over for candidates who face integrity questions, with the Commission keen on blocking them from running for elective positions. The EACC, the anti-graft body, is said to have given a damning verdict on some governors and MPs – including those already cleared – that they should be locked out of the polls. === CALL it being drained financially, or running broke. A flamboyant lawmaker from Nyanza synonymous with splashing wads of cash in a flashy lifestyle, is in dire trouble. The MP got a rude shock when, upon return from an extended three-week visit to UK, he found out that his wife had walked out of their matrimonial home. It is unclear why the wife dumped the flashy MP, but word has it that the woman was tired of the lawmaker's randy lifestyle. The wife had bumped into her husband a month ago, entertaining a university bimbo at a popular joint in Nairobi. Bouncers intervened to avert a nasty faceoff before revellers as they parried heavy punches directed at the clande, whose crime was to entertain a philanderer. === AFTER months of a political lull, Senate Majority Leader Kithure Kindiki is back in his element and with a ferocious bang, for that matter. Following concerns that the law professor had been edged out of the Jubilee kitchen cabinet, the Senator from Tharaka Nithi bounced back onto the political theatre with his guns trained on Jubilee critics. He has been holding rallies in his backyard to drum up support for Jubilee. The lawmaker, a close ally of Deputy President William Ruto, has vowed to go out of his way to mount a campaign to ensure Jubilee's reelection. He has termed the onslaught from businessman Francis Kiambi "Matanka" a big joke as he seeks to retain his seat after the August 8 polls. === SOME governors from Nyanza are hilarious in their campaigns. After winning the coveted ODM ticket, they have resorted to brandishing the nomination certificates to drum up support for themselves, instead of selling their policies to the electorate. This has left voters wondering if they are voting in governors on the basis of a party or their manifesto. One of the governors has scanned and enlarged the certificate, which he now unashamedly displays at political rallies as reason why he should be reelected, despite facing a formidable challenge from an independent candidate.
