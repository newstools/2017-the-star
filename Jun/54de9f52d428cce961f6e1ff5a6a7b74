Some Laikipia leaders and residents have launched a peace programme to ensure peace and co-existence of warring communities.There has been conflict over scarcity of resources in the area, which is largely occupied by pastoralists, who, due to scarcity of pasture and water, have been found in conflicts with ranch owners.Leaders led by John Njenga, who is contesting for senator on the Kanu ticket, said peace can only be achieved if the government ensures Laikipia residents have enough water and pasture.&ldquo;Laikipia county has a lot of problems and among them is poverty which has been brought about by scarcity of water and land for pasture,&rdquo; he said.Sopian MCA aspirant Julia Lochingamoe called for a solution to the conflict in Laikipia.She said it is painful for a mother to lose her children and people to lose their animals through conflicts over resource scarcity.Residents said the area has began experiencing some peace, but the government needs to ensure the area has water to avert more deaths of animals and children.
