Desperation and pain hit patients at Thika Level 5 Hospital when the nurses strike entered its seventh day on Sunday.Wards and the outpatient section were closed and there were only a handful of doctors, nurses and student doctors.Some services have been cancelled to ease the burden on the remaining health workers.But Deputy Medical Superintendent Joseph Waiganjo said they were doing their best.&ldquo;We are trying not to turn patients away but are unable to carry out some emergency services as nurses are required," he said."We cannot admit any patients but those who were here before the strike are well cared for."The spot check also found that all beds in the casualty department had been taken outside for repairs and cleaning.Some patients said they were disappointed by slow service and appealed to the government for a quick solution to end suffering."It has been more than an hour since I was rushed here after being hit by a car near Kiganjo estate as I was going home on a boda boda," said Jennifer Muthoni, who injured her right knee."I am in pain yet no one seems bothered about my leg."Muthoni also noted many members of the public cannot the high costs of treatment at private hospitals.Nurses went on strike last Monday, in a push for the signing of their CBA with the government, counties and the Salaries and Remuneration Commission.Several people have died since then in parts including the Coast and Western.Former Council of Governors chairman Peter Munya urged the nurses to return to work saying the SRC needs more time to meet their demands.More on this: Munya pleads with nurses to end strike, says SRC needs more time
