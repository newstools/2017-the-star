NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga on Monday convened a meeting with boda boda operators from his Bondo backyard to defuse the growing tension between them and Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga. Raila is said to have invited all the boda boda operators to his Opoda rural home on Monday morning. A boda boda operator, who requested anonymity, said they were prevailed upon not to cause chaos ahead of Raila’s campaign tour of the region. “We were under instructions not to cause any form of chaos or heckle any leader,” the source said. Raila intervened after residents allowed the NASA team to address them in Bondo later in the day. This comes a few weeks after the Bondo Transport Association issued a warning to Raila that he would not be allowed to campaign in the region in the company of Rasanga.
