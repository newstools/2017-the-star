The government has allocated Sh20 billion to implement the revised basic salary structure for public service employees after job evaluation exercise is completed.The funds will also be used to increase salaries of civil servants, effective July.Their pay was raised to between 16 and 30 per cent after negotiations between the national government and the Union of Kenya Civil Servants, which culminated to the signing of a collective bargaining agreement.The lowest earning civil servant will receive a basic salary of Sh 12,192.The CBA will be in force for four years, and will benefit employees under the Public Service Commission, the Teachers Service Commission, the Parliamentary Service Commission and the Judiciary Service Commission employees between job groups A to N.Speaking during the signing of the CBA, civil servants union secretary general Tom Odege raised concern over issues outside remuneration that are yet to be ironed out.Among the issues is lack of a post retirement National Hospital Insurance Fund and disparity in remuneration between different commissions in the civil service.&ldquo;Our members need the NHIF cover after their retirement more than when they are working, and it is not available. We therefore hope the ministry will put into consideration this and help those in retirement,&rdquo; Odege said.Youth and Gender CS Sicily Kariuki, who presided over the ceremony, however said the government is willing to engage the union further to iron out pending issues.&ldquo;There has been an outcry concerning the big gap in salaries between the JSC, the PSC and the TSC despite employees being in the same job group. And we will work together with the union to ensure this is resolved,&rdquo; Kariuki said.The CBA will see an introduction of health service allowance and nursing service allowance. Housing allowance will be harmonised as per employees grade across all regions.Veterinary officers will also receive risk allowances like their counterparts in the medical field.The union leaders further called upon the government to provide protection to the striking nurses. &ldquo;Some of the nurses who are on strike are in our union, and conditions spelt out for them to continue working are too hostile. We are asking the government to step in and protect them so that they can continue working,&rdquo; Odege said.Nurses are demanding that their delayed CBA be implemented for them to go back to work.The Salaries and Remuneration Commission has been blamed for the stalemate that has led to the three-week strike.
