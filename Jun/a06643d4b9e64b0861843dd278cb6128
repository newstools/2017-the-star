Stop harassing and intimidating the Jubilee government&rsquo;s fierce critics, former Budalang&rsquo;i MP Raphael Wanjala has told UhuRuto. He said President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto erred in blocking Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho from attending the official launch of the standard gauge railway passenger services at Mariakani on Wednesday.Wanjala spoke on Friday after he was cleared to run for Budalang&rsquo;i MP.The former legislator said Uhuru, as a President, should accommodate all Kenyans, irrespective of their political affiliation.He said political leaders are elected by the people to represent them, and it is their democratic right to attend public functions.&ldquo;He should not have barred him [Joho] from attending the function because he does not know what the governor wanted to say,&rdquo; Wanjala said.&ldquo;We are afraid he might do the same to NASA leaders from Budalang&rsquo;i if he happens to visit the region.&rdquo;He said Kenyans are barely making ends meet due to the high cost of living, yet the President is busy declaring war on his critics, instead of focussing on issues that affect citizens. Wanjala said Uhuru should apologise or else he will lose the Coast vote. Meanwhile, the former lawmaker urged the electorate to vote for him on account of the development projects he initiated when he was their MP.He is running against incumbent Ababu Namwamba.
