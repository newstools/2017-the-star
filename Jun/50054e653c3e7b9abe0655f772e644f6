Despite cruising to a slow-start-win at the Golden Spike meeting in Ostrava on Wednesday, it was plain to see that all is not quite right with Usain Bolt, who rather worryingly has niggling issues with his form, fitness and perhaps even his mind just two months to the London World Championships.His time in Ostrava was 10.06sec, which is hardly grounds to search for a lost soul, but equally it was a good deal short of the standards he has set over a career of fast-twitch brilliance.The fact he only marginally beat Yunier Perez, a Cuban running a personal best of 10.09sec, is a little concerning, and more troubling was his admission of &lsquo;some health issues&rsquo;. He said afterwards that he would be visiting his doctor, Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt, in Germany for help with the &lsquo;tight back&rsquo; which appears to be slowing him down in a farewell season that is yet to hit its stride.His season-opening run of 10.03sec in Jamaica on June 10 was, in his words, &lsquo;horrifying&rsquo;, a combination of a slow start and subdued finish. In Ostrava his start was only marginally better and his customary mid-race burst was barely noticeable. His margin of victory in a mediocre field was surprisingly small margin.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not happy with the time but I&rsquo;m just getting into my running, improving the execution,&rdquo; the 30-year-old said. &ldquo;I never worry. It&rsquo;s just my back, as always. My doctor told me over the years that the older I get the worse it is going to get so I just really have to try and keep it in check. I need to go see him to make sure everything is smooth because it is a bit tight. But I didn&rsquo;t get injured and that&rsquo;s the key thing. I am happy about that - it&rsquo;s just about sorting it out and I should be fine for London.&rdquo;
