Lugari MP Ayub Savula arrived at the Lumakanda subcounty headquarters in style to present his papers to the IEBC.He is defending his seat on the ANC ticket and was cleared on Thursday.Savula&rsquo;s rivals &mdash; former Kakamega chief of staff Nabii Nabwera (ODM), Joseph Lunani (Ford Kenya), Charles Werangai (UDP) and Joab Kinzi of Jubilee &mdash; arrived with a few of their supporters and left once they were cleared.But not the flamboyant incumbent. Business at the IEBC offices came to a near-standstill when Savula arrived in a 100-vehicle convoy and a chopper branded in ANC colours.The chopper hovered in the skies as Savula went through the clearance process while the occupants of the vehicles filled up every inch of space in the IEBC station, waiting to escort him back home.The convoy started the journey at Makhukhuni market in Matete division at 9am and went through Kaburengu-Lwandeti-Mukhuyu-Chekalini road and finally to Lumakanda at 2pm.Mesmerised residents rushed from their homes and lined along the road to catch a glimpse of the procession &mdash; the longest to be witnessed in the area in recent years.The chopper flew back and forth over the road as though guiding drivers on which routes to take.Savula made stopovers to address residents &mdash; some followed the convoy on foot to the IEBC offices.He addressed a crowd outside the IEBC offices soon after he was cleared.In 2013, Savula surprised many when he arrived escorted by a number of choppers to introduce himself for the UDF nominations.Savula urged Western voters to support ANC so they can strengthen Musalia Mudavadi&rsquo;s influence in readiness for the 2022 presidential race.&ldquo;Mudavadi needs to be supported as the Luhya spokesman by getting more seats through ANC. This will give him leverage in future negotiations,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll coordinate the ANC campaigns in Kakamega county to ensure the party wins all or majority of the seats.&rdquo;Expressing confidence that he will retain his seat in August, Savula said he will seek a higher office in 2022 after serving his second term as MP.&ldquo;We want to make room for a new generation of leaders and that is why we have to push Mudavadi to become President in 2022 so that some of us are able to move up,&rdquo; he said.
