When it became apparent late into the US election last year that Donald Trump was going to lose to Hillary Clinton, the former started preparing his supporters for the impending loss, claiming the elections were rigged. Everyone knew it was not possible to rig.Despite this being the case, people were concerned that were Clinton to win and Trump refuse to concede, violence would have no doubt erupted in the US, in a manner never seen before. This was because Trump supporters were an angry mob, armed to the teeth and not shy of using their guns.Trump himself was openly encouraging violence in his rallies long before the election was held, leading many to believe there would be violence across the country were he to lose.Fortunately, this did not happen as Trump won the election.While post-election violence is alien in the US and other advanced democracies, the same can&rsquo;t be said about our beloved Kenya. To be honest, Kenyans are unease as we approach this election. A survey done late last year showed most Kenyans were afraid that violence would occur again in the August 8 General Election.According to the Star, a survey on citizens&rsquo; views on security and safety in the country found that 70 per cent were &ldquo;afraid&rdquo;, 44 per cent &ldquo;very afraid&rdquo; and three out of 10 citizens ( 28 per cent) not worried about the possibility.This concern is not unfounded or without any number of reasons, not the least of which is African leaders&rsquo; threatening the use of force or actual use of force to cling to power.This wanton disregard of election laws and use of state machine to cling to power at any cost is a recipe for violence, avoidable only if those in charge have common sense, value life and the preservation of our beloved country.In 2002, Kenyans said enough is enough and got out in large numbers to vote against President Daniel Moi and his project Uhuru Kenyatta such that even the incumbent couldn&rsquo;t use state machine and corruption to cling to power. The momentum against him and his project was so strong that he didn&rsquo;t even bother to rig. He accepted the will of the people.We know what happened in 2008 and, surely, none of us who love and care about our country ever wants us to re-live those dark days of our history.Indeed, the expectation from the opposition standpoint is NASA replicates what we experienced in 2002 with a similar outcome &mdash; a rejection of President Uhuru and saying no to further suffering and punishment due to his failed government under which Kenyans are suffering.The only difference this time round is that like-minded voters will overwhelmingly vote in August to eject the very same Uhuru they rejected in 2002. In other words, the choice Kenyans will make on August 8, as was the case in 2002, is between a proven failed President, and a man who has made the case that he has what it takes to transform this country only to be rigged out in each of the past two general elections.Meanwhile, Uhuru has his own choice: To let Kenyans choose their President in a free, fair and transparent election or attempt to thwart the will of the people at the polls by in-your-face rigging at the risk of yet again having the country plunge into chaos, or worse.That&rsquo;s a choice a rational person who cares and loves his country would make with ease and without even a moment&rsquo;s thinking and reflection. It&rsquo;s the decision we hope and pray the President makes.Legal expert and political commentator in the US
