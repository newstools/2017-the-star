Safaricom Limited have entered into a Sh100m partnership with Football Kenya Federation in a bid to develop football at the grassroots between September 2017 and March 2018.Dubbed &lsquo;Chapa dimba na Safaricom&rsquo;, the tournament follows the Sakata Ball model that halted in 2012 after a fallout between Safaricom and the then FKF management led by Sam Nyamweya.While the previous tournament targeted players aged between 17 and 23 years, the new tournament will comprise of school-going students aged between 16 and 20 years with at least 3000 players targeted in the initial first six months.Registration for the competition opens on Monday where interested teams are expected to register at chapadimba.safaricom.co.ke or pick registration forms from Safaricom shops or FKF branch offices. The verification process will take place next month and in August ahead of the September kick-off.The winning teams in both the boys&rsquo; and girls&rsquo; category will pocket Sh1m each. The winners will also secure a trip to London in April next year for a training camp where they will also be mentored by tournament ambassador, Harambee Stars captain and Tottenham midfielder Victor Wanyama.In addition, they will watch Wanyama live in action for Spurs in the English Premier League.&ldquo;I am happy that through this partnership with Safaricom, I have the opportunity to motivate young players and encourage them to participate in football and develop their skills. I hope my personal journey will inspire the next generation of Kenyan footballers just like my brother MacDonald Mariga motivated me to chase after my dreams. I look forward to meeting young footballers from all over the country,&rdquo; said Wanyama.In addition to the running costs of the tournament, Safaricom has set aside over Sh10 million shillings for other prizes as well as renovation of some of the local community pitches.&ldquo;Football is one of the most unifying tool in the world and we aim to give our youth an opportunity to grow and exhibit their talent. We are glad to be back in football as we continue strengthening our commitment to supporting sports in this country,&rdquo; said Safaricom CEO, Bob Collymore.The tournament will run on a group stage, knock-out stages, regional finals and grand finale format with FKF scouting for players for the national under 17 and under 20 teams.&ldquo;One of my visions for football in this country is to see Kenya produce the next big global football stars. We have the talent but lack the opportunities. I am glad that Safaricom has come on board to help FKF work towards fulfilling this dream,&rdquo; said FKF president Nick Mwendwa.
