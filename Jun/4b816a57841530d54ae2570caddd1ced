Homa Bay County Commissioner Kassim Farrah has directed deputy county commissioners to hold peace meetings with politicians ahead of the August 8 polls. Speaking to journalists yesterday in his office, Farrah said the forums are aimed at creating a peaceful environment for politicians to avoid violence during campaigns. “We don’t expect political violence in this county. The August election should be as peaceful as possible,” Farrah said. He said the eight deputy county commissioners in the area will hold meetings with MCA and parliamentary candidates in their respective subcounties. “Ndhiwa, Rangwe, Mbita and Suba subcounties will hold their meetings this Wednesday. Rachuonyo North, Rachuonyo South, Rachuonyo East and Homa Bay subcounties will hold theirs on Thursday,” Farrah said. “Some politicians cause violence yet they don’t know the consequences.” He asked residents to maintain peace.
