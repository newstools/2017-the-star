The National Hospital Insurance Fund has come a long way since its inception in 1966 as a department under the Ministry of Health.Although it suffered a long period of stagnation with administrative costs consuming half of the members&rsquo; contributions, things have changed.The Fund&rsquo;s membership has grown tremendously and now close to 24 million Kenyans are covered, for as little as Sh500 a month per principal contributor.We laud the NHIF for the innovative packages, especially the surgical package, where it covers members for up to Sh500,000. This has eased the burden on Kenyans undergoing specialised treatment.We also laud the Fund for the [email&#160;protected] cardiac care indicator project that will fully fund heart surgeries for 1,435 Kenyans to reduce backlog in local hospitals.But there are more challenges ahead and the Fund will still need to continue reinventing itself. First, the Sh500,000 limit for surgical procedures is barely enough. Many procedures cost more than Sh1 million and are unavailable locally.The Fund also needs to expand the criteria it uses to formulate who benefits.
