Police have arrested 92 Kenya Defence Forces recruits who had reported to the Moi Barracks Recruits Training College with fake calling letters. Eldoret West police boss Samuel Mutunga yesterday said the recruits are being held to establish how they got the letters.They had reported to start training at the military college.&ldquo;We will investigate the matter fully and charge the suspects in court,&rdquo; he said.The fake recruits were arrested during screening by military police at the barracks.Mutunga said they will be charged in batches &ldquo;because they are many&rdquo;.It is the largest number of suspects ever arrested at the barracks after a KDF recruitment.Before any recruitment, KDF always informs the public that the process is free.It warns that bribery and other acts of corruption are against the law and suspects are arrested and prosecuted, besides the forfeited money and property.Those found guilty are imprisoned.Last week, two people were arrested in Eldoret for carrying out a fake KDF recruitment drive. They were found issuing fake recruitment letters to youths countrywide.One was identified as Augustine Wambogo from Meru. He is said to have been impersonating a KDF officer.Mutunga said police recovered more than Sh750,000 from the two.The other suspect has yet to be identified.The money was part of bribes collected by the suspect from applicants.Mutunga said police also recovered three fake calling letters, which the suspects issued to three people to join the RTC.He said a woman travelled to Eldoret to pay the suspect so that her son could be recruited, but she went into hiding on learning that police were looking for her.Police also found one Anthony Gitonga from Meru who had allegedly paid Sh400,000 to the suspects so he could be recruited.Mutunga has warned the public not to be conned, adding that recruitment ended last month and no payments were required.&ldquo;Those who qualified are supposed to report for training next week. These suspects have taken advantage of the process to con the public and collect money from unsuspecting people,&rdquo; he said.He said the recruitment was transparently conducted at designated venues without any payments.The drive took place last month and was staggered across the counties.Successful applicants report to the training camp together.
