A meeting convened on Friday June 2 in Kisumu by the ODM Nyanza Presidential Campaign Team led by Homa Bay Woman rep Gladys Wanga and NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga&rsquo;s elder brother Oburu Oginga did not achieve its main purpose.In fact, it flopped after it became evident that a large section of the expected audience had given it a wide berth, putting the clarion call for reconciliation into a precarious situation. My take from what is happening on the ground is that the six-piece voting pattern being pushed by ODM will not work, and if the party cares for a higher voter turnout in the presidential race, it should drop it like a hot potato. Failure to do that, they are likely to jump from a frying pan into the fire just to get the numbers to push their agenda in Parliament.If ODM wants to get the numbers in Parliament &mdash; the National Assembly and the Senate &mdash; in the county assemblies as well as governors, it must involve the people and respect their will. It is now late, and anything being forced down the throats of the electorate is bound to backfire.The impact of the April ODM nominations spells doom for the party&rsquo;s future, and creates room for more parties to penetrate the ODM strongholds. The talk in Nyanza is that no politician will ever again waste his or her time and resources to participate in ODM primaries.The meeting, which was attended by mainly ODM aspirants from across the four Nyanza counties &mdash; which according to former Regional Development PS Carey Orege was made up of IEBC nominees, and not the party due to the bungled nominations &mdash; was turned into a six-piece voting pattern meeting by speakers led by national chairman John Mbadi, Oginga, Siaya Senator James Orengo and party boss Raila.Reconciliation talk, let alone resolution, cannot be part of any meeting once those who claim to have been robbed of their victories in broad day light either refused to attend or were not invited to the meeting. Some sycophants took to the floor to please Raila, saying how all was well and were committed to the party. They were roundly applauded by youths mobilised from Siaya, Kisumu and Homa Bay counties by governor candidates. Only a handful attended from Migori and Governor Okoth Obado did not attend.The strong independent candidates who are causing party nominees sleepless nights for the assembly wards, parliamentary and governor positions such as Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo, Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo, Kasipul MP Oyugi Magwanga, former Cabinet minister Ochillo Ayacko, and Kisumu Governor Jack Ranguma were conspicuously absent together with their foot soldiers.What shocked me most is when Mbadi stated that an apology to those who were denied party tickets could only be given in the meeting and not outside, or any public function, adding that the majority of those who defected from the party to become independent candidates lost squarely in the nominations.In my opinion, this was the highest level of arrogance from a top party leader, who for years has kept on assuring the aspirants and the public that the nominations would be free and fair as a departure from the 2013 debacle, which saw 380,000 fail to vote because of voter apathy.This was to the chagrin of a few attendees, with the feeling that all is not well on the ground, and any call for six-piece vote rubs salt on the wounds of the aggrieved and can easily drive the apathy to more than a million people.Speakers in the meeting called on the party leadership to embrace independent candidates as well as other candidates who jumped ship to join NASA-friendly parties. This call landed on deaf ears.If public outrage in Siaya, Homa Bay, Migori and Kisumu counties on governor positions is anything to go by, then ODM should prepare to lose big. The main undoing for ODM&rsquo;s leadership is to promise supporters, members and aspirants that it had learnt its lessons in 2007 and 2013.This was never to be. Homa Bay governor candidate Cyprian Awiti was declared a winner without any result from any of the eight subcounties.Some aspirants were temporarily declared winners at the tallying centres and names were changed immediately they arrived at the party headquarters. In some cases despite the ruling by dispute resolution mechanisms for the party, the office of the registrar of political parties and the High Court, things either remained the same or worse.
