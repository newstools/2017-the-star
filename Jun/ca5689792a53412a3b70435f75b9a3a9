Director of Public Prosecutions Keriako Tobiko wants to prefer more criminal charges against Embakasi East independent MP aspirant Stephen Waruinge, who is facing charges of threatening to kill Jubilee Party aspirant Francis Mureithi.When the case came up yesterday before Milimani senior principal magistrate Martha Mutuku, the prosecution applied for an adjournment. It said it needs more time to file more charges against the accused. The magistrate directed the case to be heard on July 14. Maina is out on Sh500,000 bail. Defence lawyer Kibe Mungai said Maina was arrested by officers from Parliament police station. He felt the arrest is politically motivated. The charges against Maina states that on April 19, at Lacaste Club in Embakasi East, he said, &ldquo;Hata Mugabe Were alishinda hii kiti lakini hakukalia (Even Mugabe Were won the seat but never occupied it)&rdquo;. The words were meant to threaten to kill Mureithi.
