Kenyan international marksman Guy Jack shook off tight competition from a top field of 37 firers to win the- Dhruv Auto Clinic Shotgun sporting tournament over the weekend.Many sharpshooters flocked the Ruiru Sports Club shooting range for the showpiece but competition soon narrowed to five and thereafter two for the top honours.At the end of firing at 50 flying clay objects in seven different shooting points characterized by divergent dynamics, Jack and Christopher Young were tied with each posting 44 points out of the possible 50.The two went for a tie-breaker where Jack won by one point and was crowned winner as Young settled for the second place. Dhruv Shah carded 40 points to place third whereas Joss Taylor and Denis Lucas scored 38 and 37 respectively made it to the top five.Both Ken Taylor and Andres Langhorn benched sixth with 36 points, while Alan Mckittrick and Gran Calder too shared spoils to finish in the eighth position with 35. Domi Morelli completed the top 10 with 34 points.Myra Jadeja was the only lady who contested in the Sunday competitions and she managed to take down eight birds (the overhead flying objects), but all the rabbits (objects flying less than one meter above the ground) eluded her shots. With the meagre eight out of 50 points, Jadeja finished in position 33 of 37.The weekend&rsquo;s best three&mdash;Jack, Young and Shah&mdash;placed Kenya fifth in men&rsquo;s skeet team event during the 2015 Africa shooting Championships in Cairo, Egypt. They finished behind winners Egypt, Senegal, Morocco and Tunisia.
