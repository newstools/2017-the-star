The IEBC has come under scrutiny minutes after saying Kenyans can check their voter registration status by texting ID or passport number to 70000. "Both online and SMS methods of checking your registration details are available," the electoral body said via Twitter on Thursday.

One said sending the number 0 presents the name Stanley Gitari Mucira of Kirinyaga county, Gichugu polling station and code 003. When you send number three, you get the name Caroline Anyango Odhiambo of Mombasa county, Mvita polling station and code 032.. But numbers such as 45 result in the notification that there are no such records. "...no records found. Please visit any IEBC offices near you for more information," read as text seen by The Star. Some social media users asked the commission to explain what happened to the voters register audit. "I have sent ID number 0 to that number and this is what I got. Nobody has ID number 0 so how was he registered," said Twitter user 'Coll_Odhiambo'. 'Lmutisya' demanded a credible saying this should not be the case after the "highly publicised audit of the register". "I thought you were supposed to clean the voter register...I got the same results when I sent number 0 to 70000," presenter Mwanaisha Chidzuga‏ said. Tony Watima‏ said: "Someone is registered with ID number 0 but with my ID number it tells me 'no records found'. IEBC, what games are these?" The month-long voter verification drive by the IEBC ended on June 9 with only 20-30 per cent voters turning up. Audit firm KPMG found there were at least a million dead people in the IEBC register but NASA said they did a shoddy job.

The age group accounts for 9,930,315 valid voters from the total 19,611,423 registered. More than 88,600 dead voters were later expunged.
