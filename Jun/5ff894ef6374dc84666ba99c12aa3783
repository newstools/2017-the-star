Kisumu Governor Jack Ranguma has asked his opponents to show their development record and tell residents why they deserve to be elected. Ranguma is defending his seat as independent. He will face ODM governor nominee Anyang&rsquo; Nyong&rsquo;o, JP&rsquo;s Atieno Otieno and banker David Wayiera of the Alternative Party of Kenya.Ranguma said politicians should compete on policies and achievements, not propaganda. &ldquo;Let them tell us what development they have initiated for the period they have been in power,&rdquo; he said.Ranguma, who maintained he was rigged out of the ODM nominations, on Saturday expressed confidence he will carry the day in August. &ldquo;The race is between stability and certainty in the economic agenda that I am pursuing, versus the instability and uncertainty that my opponents are offering,&rdquo; he said.
