Nairobi MCAs want seven county officers prosecuted for invading county assembly premises and injuring their colleague and staff.The officials include head of inspectorate Francis Munyambu, Lands chief officer Stephen Mwangi, chief valuer Isaac Wanyoike and workers' union official Benson Oliang&rsquo;a .In a report by the Powers and Privileges Committee tabled in the chamber on Thursday, the ward reps said the officers led a contingent of county askaris in storming the premises on April 7.&ldquo;In the company of others and led by himself [Munyambu] in his capacity, breached provisions of the Powers and Privileges statute, gained access to the assembly precincts, cordoned off the floor and constructed a concrete wall notwithstanding the fact that this was a gazetted precincts,&rdquo; reads the report.The two arms of the county government have been at loggerhead over the ownership of offices on the fourth and fifth floors of the Northern Wing of City Hall.The county inspectorate officers and the Kenya County Government Workers Union officials stormed the floor and reclaimed the offices, which had been taken over by the assembly.There was a physical altercation and police used teargas to stop the fighting. Two serjeant-at-arms and one MCA were injured in the fracas.The report stated that the inspectorate officers were armed with grinders, hydraulic cutters and heavy metal equipment.Inspectorate officers Albert Koech, Caleb Otieno and Eva Wairuko are among the seven the MCAs want prosecuted.Two weeks ago, Director of Public Prosecution Keriako Tobiko ordered DCI boss Ndegwa Muhoro to investigate following the MCAs' petition.Speaker Alex Magelo says the assembly rightfully owns the premises after it gazetted the entire wing, from the basement to fifth floor, as its precincts in September 2015. But the executive says the offices belong to the Lands department and will not surrender them to the assembly.In March, county secretary Robert Ayisi said some 47 workers from the Evaluation department were working from the corridors, while more than 200,000 property records were inaccessible.&ldquo;The chief valuer is now operating in a small corner at the City Hall Annex where the Survey department set him up, while his team is operating in the corridors,&rdquo; he said.The MCAs said in the report that the officers also defied the summons to appeal before the committee to explain the incident.
