The church should lead the way in praying for peaceful elections, NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga has said.Raila said even though politicians must observe the law during campaigns, religious organisations have a bigger role to pray for the nation.He was speaking in Bondo on Sunday during the consecration and enthronement of Canon David HellingtoneKodia as an Anglican bishop.Raila was accompanied by other NASA principals."Personally together with my NASA team, we will observe peace and order in our campaigns," he said.This afternoon, the opposition team will address a political rally in Kapsabet.On Saturday, Raila said the Jubilee government had failed in its mandate to serve Kenyans and does not deserve a second term.He spoke when he led the NASA brigade at the launch of the presidential campaigns in Bulhungu stadium, Kakamega."We already have 10 million votes safe in our baskets. We are now seeking for more votes from you and i urge each and every one of you to go and verify their voter registration details," Raila said.More on this read: Jubilee has failed, we will oust them, Raila says
