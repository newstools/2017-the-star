Politicians should desist from using the youth to foment electoral chaos and instead engage them in peaceful contributions towards the elections, a group of artistes has said. Nick Mutuma, Fena Gitu and Redfourth Chorus released a track called Jiactivate. They will be part of an ongoing nationwide campaign by the same name. “The idea is to transform Kenyan youth into active ambassadors in their communities and to encourage them to shun electoral violence. Youths have to be involved, and it goes beyond elections or forming a declaration. There must be reciprocity between the youth and the leaders we elect,” Redfourth’s ‘Filah’ Tuju said.
