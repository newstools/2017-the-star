Embu county commissioner Esther Maina has revealed some politicians known to cause violence and who have formed gangs are being monitored by police.Maina said the criminals operate like militia groups, and are used by politicians to cause chaos.She spoke at Moi Stadium on Saturday during a peace rally. Maina mentioned two groups: Chapa Ilale which operates in Runyenjes, and Mkuki in the Dallas area.The official said several members of Chapa Ilale are under investigation after they recorded statements with police. She said some politicians &ldquo;spit venom every time they open their mouth to speak&rdquo;, which results in violence. Maina said they will not be spared if they engage in acts that inflame passions during the campaign period. The administrator said they are on high alert, and politicians and goons found perpetrating violence will be arrested and prosecuted.Maina said security agents in Embu county will not relent in their effort to ensure peace is maintained in the run-up to the August 8 General Election. &ldquo;Aspirants for various political seats should know there is a code of conduct that guides election campaigns, and if they violate any of them they will be dealt with accordingly,&rdquo; she said. Maina told residents not to allow leaders to divide them along tribal or clan lines. She said some politicians use clannism to ascend to power, leaving the community divided. Maina further warned candidates against using their agents to deface their rivals&rsquo; posters. She said the action will be treated as an act of political violence, which attracts a fine of Sh2 million or a six-month jail term.She said she has received complaints and will deal with offenders.
