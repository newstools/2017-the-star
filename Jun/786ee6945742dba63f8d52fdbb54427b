The August 8 election could be thrown into disarray if lawmakers fail to approve a request by the National Treasury to okay the release of Sh2.5 billion to pay for printing of ballot papers.The IEBC is in a dilemma, because the money allocated is contained in the 2017-18 Budget.The next financial year starts on July 1, yet the IEBC is required to have the money available to pay the supplier, who will win the bid for the printing and supply of ballot papers before MPs adjourn for the polls next Thursday.The procurement process is underway and would be concluded before the beginning of the next financial year. With MPs having approved the 2017-18 Appropriations Bill and signed into law by President Uhuru Kenyatta, the IEBC cannot be allowed to spend the money before July 1.MPs reject pleas by budget team MPs yesterday rejected pleas from the Budget and Appropriations Committee chairman Mutava Musyimi, who argued there is need for the lawmakers to expedite the process so as not to throw preparations for the election into jeopardy.&ldquo;This is a weighty matter, the danger is that the House will adjourn next week, we have only four sittings left. I know no other way to do this, since the printing of ballot papers for the August 8 polls must be done,&rdquo; he pleaded.Musyimi told MPs they only needed to approve the request to credit the IEBC with Sh2.5 billion so that when the next financial year begins, the money will be debited from the electoral agency.&ldquo;The issue of breaking the law doesn&rsquo;t arise, the Treasury exists in perpetuity and getting into a debt of Sh2.5 billion is not an issue as they will tidy the financial books in the next financial year,&rdquo; he said.Speaker Justin Muturi asked the committee to summon the Treasury and the IEBC to explain the logic behind the request and table the report next Tuesday, two days to the closure of the 11th Parliament.Request turned down Also rejected was a request for an additional Sh300 million for the National Intelligence Service, until MPs get a convincing justification.MPs faulted the budget committee for bringing the request on the plenary before having the relevant committee scrutinise the budget.The spy agency has been allocated another Sh900 million in the Supplementary Budget to scale up its surveillance ahead of the August 8 polls.The Defence and Foreign Relations Committee will today meet top officers from the NIS to question them over the request.
