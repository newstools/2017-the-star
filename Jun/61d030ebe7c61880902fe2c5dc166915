Mt Kenya youths have told off Opposition leaders for disputing the ballot paper tender awarded to Dubai-based firm Al Ghurair.NASA has linked top Jubilee officials to the award and called for the sacking of IEBC CEO Ezra Chiloba and Director of Election Operations Immaculate Kasait.The company is to print about 120 million ballot papers, election results forms and poll registers for the August 8 general elections.NASA flag bearer Raila Odinga said on Tuesday that they have information indicating the firm has had contracts with Jubilee officials for at least three years.More on this: Jubilee leaders pushed for Al Ghurair printing tender, Raila claims in polls warningBut the youths said the Opposition is only making such allegations because they sense defeat in the August 8 general elections."There is nothing good in this country that the Opposition sees. They keep coming up with something to derail either government projects or the progress of something," caucus chair Linford Mutembei said on Thursday."We want to tell them it is Kenyans who will vote in the elections, not the Independent Election and Boundaries Commission."Mutembei said the Opposition has been misleading Kenyans on the issue since IEBC has already made the tendering process clear."It is unfair for NASA to keep on complaining yet they were involved by the IEBC in the procurement of ballot papers. They want to put the country in a panic mood over the issue and paint a bad picture of Jubilee."Mutembei said NASA's "reckless statements" will lead to volatility in the election period as youths will be incited to violence."Youths should be very careful with information being given by some politicians as some statements could lead to mass action...we cannot afford to plunge into violence," he said.The chair asked politicians to lead peaceful campaigns and avoid name-calling, incitement and spreading propaganda for selfish interests."You should think about people who are not eligible to vote. They are our children...we need to make a better Kenya for them."
