DPP Keriako Tobiko says there is enough evidence to hold former NHIF top managers for conspiring to defraud the insurer of Sh96 million.Tobiko, who has been prosecuting former MD Richard Kerich and others since May 2013, wants the court to find he and five other parties guilty and put them on defence.The others are Marwa Fadhili, David Kipruto and Clinix Healthcare directors Toddy Madahana and Anthony Chacko.The four and the health facility were jointly accused of conspiring to defraud the entity of millions. Kerich is also facing abuse of office charges.The money was meant for the civil service and disciplined forces' medical schemes."The republic submits that it has established a prima facie case against the accused persons through the 28 witnesses who have testified," senior prosecuting officer Daniel Karuri said."This is coupled with documentary exhibits produced to warrant this court to place each on their defence." The court will rule on July 3 on whether the accused have a case to answer.The prosecutor, who has closed the case, says enough evidence has been submitted to prove the accused conspired to defraud the scheme in January 2012.Karuri said evidence produced in court has established they knew the health facility had no capacity to provide required services."There was no competitive bidding process and the clinic was given an undue advantage over other qualified medical schemes."The prosecutor further said they have proven Kerich used his office to influence the implementation of the civil servant's medical scheme.In 2011, the Ministry of State decided to provide medical cover for all civil servants and discipline service officers.A tender was floated but upon completion of the process, none of the bidders had qualified.The ministry then opted to negotiate directly with NHIF.An agreed premium for the cover was Sh2,162,273,208.77 for the first six months, followed by Sh4,324,546,417.54 annually.The scheme, which was to be provided by NHIF recognised facilities, commenced in January 2012.Various facilities were contracted. Among them was Clinix which was allotted 56,747 members.Pamela Nyaboke, the procurement manager at NHIF, testified that the fund did not use any procurement process in the identification of providers for the scheme.Another witness, account manager Jacinta Nyakio, said she approved the payment of Sh202,161,187.50 to Clinix Health care.Read: Audit clears Clinix in NHIF investigation
