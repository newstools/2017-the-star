Tanzania President John Magufuli has said students who get pregnant will no longer benefit from government sponsored education.He said the government has set aside funds for free education for students and not parents, arguing that allowing students to continue with education after giving birth will encourage teen pregnancies. &ldquo;It will reach a point where a whole class will be full of parents. When a teacher is in class teaching, they all go out to breastfeed,&rdquo; Magufuli said.He was speaking on Thursday during a public rally in Bagamoyo in the coastal province of Pwani. Magufuli said his administration will not tolerate student pregnancies even when under pressure from non-governmental organisations. &ldquo;These NGOs can open their own schools for parents. But I will not give funds to educate parents,&rdquo; Magufuli said. The President said in the event that a pregnancy is accidental, there are other activities one can engage in after giving birth like sewing and agriculture. He said students are only allowed to get pregnant at university level.
