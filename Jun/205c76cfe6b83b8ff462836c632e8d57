Overall inflation, a measure of changes in average prices of goods and services, rose to a 58-month high of 11.70 per cent last month from from 11.48 per cent in April, state’s statistician reported yesterday. Kenya National Bureau of Statistics attributed the rise in inflation, although slower than last month, to a rise in food inflation, which went up 21.52 per cent on average year-on-year in May. “The food and non-alcoholic drinks index increased by 1.26 per cent compared to a rise of 3.55 per cent witnessed between March and April,” KNBS director-general Zachary Mwangi (pictured)said in a statement. “However the food index increased due to rise in prices of sugar, milk, maize grain and other food items which outweighed the decrease.” There was, however, a significant decline in the prices of sukuma wiki (kales), cabbages, potatoes and spinach in May compared to June, largely due to ongoing rains, he added. The price of a kilo of maize grain jumped the highest at 54.30 per cent year-on-year to Sh64.35, closely followed by the cost of sugar which rose 49.4 per cent to an average price of Sh168.18. Mwangi also attributed the high inflation to a rise in the cost of kerosene, cooking gas and charcoal which resulted in a 0.06 per cent rise in the housing, water, electricity, and other fuels’ index. A litre of kerosene went up 38.2 per cent.
