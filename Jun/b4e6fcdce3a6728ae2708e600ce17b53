Rights groups and the NCIC met more than 50 Kaya elders in Kwale for talks on countering extremism, amid fears the MRC is asking people not to vote.In December last year, MRC spokesperson Richard Lewa said they were planning to move to court to stop the IEBC's activities in the region before the next general election.Lewa said as MRC members, they still maintain Pwani si Kenya and IEBC services are not needed in the region.Read: You&rsquo;re not welcome here for now, MRC warns IEBC teamBut on Thursday, MRC secretary general Randy Nzai denied the claims of interference saying they are part of the government's plan to harass members."No leader of the group has told people not to vote. We all know participating in the election is a democratic right," Nzai told The Star by phone.He added the group is peaceful and has no intentions of causing chaos or asking people not to vote.The two-day forum at Hill park hotel brought together elders and officials from the National Cohesion and Integration Commission, Human Rights Agenda and Malaika Foundation.Its aim was to promote the elders' preparedness for the poll and strengthen the war on violent extremism.Kwale is among 19 counties which the NCIC declared hot spots due to tribal politics and the existence of the Mombasa Republican Council.More on this: [VIDEO] NCIC identifies 19 counties at risk of violence in 2017 Abdallah Mnyenze, Coast region Kaya Council of Elders chairman, said the MRC rhetoric is unfortunate and that they will do their part to prevent chaos.Chairman Kassim Mnyeto said: &ldquo;We will accept a president elected by Kenyans because we have not taken sides with anyone so far."Malaika Foundation official Darius Isaboke assured the elders will help the government achieve peace during the polls.County commissioner Kutswa Olaka noted the government will not allow MRC to stop citizens from exercising their democratic right to elect leaders.&ldquo;Elders should take charge because in 2010, political and constitutional issues raised by such groups were addressed. We will not give them a chance to do anything. We will also not allow incitement on tribal, religions and gender lines and chaos because of political differences," he said on Wednesday.Olaka urged the elders to guard forests and ensure they are not misused by gangs since they will be held responsible.NCIC commissioner Roba Sharamo said elders should be given the attention they need as they play key roles in the pursuit of peace.Sharamo noted joblessness has caused youths to cross over to countries such as Somalia to be militants' wives and cooks, and warned they end up dying.&ldquo;Eighty per cent went to look for jobs. That is why the government has undertaken amnesty programmes for those willing to come back."Sharamo urged incoming governors to set aside funds for peace initiatives, instead of letting the government work alone.He said Northern Kenya counties are setting aside between Sh50 million and Sh100 million for such initiatives.The commissioner regretted that violent extremism has affected tourism.Human Rights Agenda CEO Yusuf Lule said the dialogue with Kaya elders was timely since Kwale is among areas with a history of conflict during elections.The talks will end today with the signing of a peace accord.
