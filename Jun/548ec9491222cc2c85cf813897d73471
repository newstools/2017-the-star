President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday issued 7,137 title deeds to Tharaka Nithi residents.This brought the total number of title deeds delivered by the Jubilee government in the last four years to more than three million.Uhuru said the presentation of 7,137 title deeds, including one for Tharaka Campus, a constituent college of the Chuka University, will be followed by another 13,000 that are ready for issuance in the county.&ldquo;We said we had a solution to the land problem and promised to deliver three million title deeds,&rdquo; the President said.He spoke in Marimanti as he took the Jubilee manifesto to residents, hours after it was launched in Nairobi.Uhuru criticised the opposition for trying to malign his administration&rsquo;s development record, saying the leaders held senior positions in previous governments, but did nothing to improve the lives of Kenyans.On infrastructure, the President said Jubilee is the first government to tarmack roads in Tharaka Nithi county.The national government has invested more than Sh12 billion to improve the road network in the county.The President, who was accompanied by Deputy President William Ruto, assured residents that his administration plans to construct a dam in Tharaka Nithi to alleviate the water problem in the county.&ldquo;We have allocated Sh25 billion for the Tharaka Dam that will supply enough water for domestic consumption and irrigation in the whole county,&rdquo; Uhuru said. Ruto urged residents to reelect the Jubilee administration, saying the party has delivered on its pledges.He said unlike the opposition, Jubilee development record in the last four years is open for all to see.Ruto cited the national government's investment of Sh810 million to provide state-of-the-art medical equipment to Chuka Level 5 Hospital and Tharaka Level 4 Hospital through the Managed Equipment Services project as some of the initiatives that have transformed the lives of residents.&ldquo;This has brought specialised health care services closer to you. This and other initiatives that are improving your lives are the reason why we ask you to vote for the Jubilee team that is focused on development and prosperity for all Kenyans,&rdquo; the DP said.The two were accompanied by Senate Majority leader Kindiki Kithure, National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi and Jubilee governor aspirant Muthomi Njuki.
