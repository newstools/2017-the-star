Twenty-five election cohesion officers will be deployed to various parts of Mombasa during the campaigning period.The officers will be recording and reporting any incitement and hate speech statements made by politicians.This will enable police to initiate the prosecution process against those politicians found culpable of inciting people.Numerous hate speech and incitement cases have stalled in courts for lack of evidence.The media has been blamed for failing to produce videos and audios, which can be used as evidence against these politicians in courts, leading to dismissal of many such cases.The 25 officers have been trained by Haki Africa, the National Cohesion and Integration Commission and the IEBC.Speaking during the training of the officers, Haki Africa director Hussein Khalid said they will forward the evidence to security agencies, instead of relying on media alone.He said the action was prompted by a report listing Mombasa as a hotspot for violence.The whole project has cost the civil society group Sh1.8 million.
