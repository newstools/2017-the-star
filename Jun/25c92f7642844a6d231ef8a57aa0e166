With buttery flaky pastry, and perfectly cooked cinnamon covered apples, can anything really beat a homemade apple pie? I learnt how to make apple pie quite early on, mainly because I watched a lot of TV as a child. It was revered in old school movies and cartoons. You know the scene; a lady makes an apple pie and leaves it on the windowsill and the smell draws you in! The recipe itself is fairly simple, the tricky part can be the pastry. I&rsquo;ve included the method to making the pastry yourself, but you can also buy it ready made.IngredientsPastry255g plain flour140g butter cubedPinch of salt6tbsp cold waterFillingCooking apples (The sliced apples should fill the baking tin, but not overflow)1tbsp cinnamon Brown sugar1tbsp NutmegLemon juice MethodPreheat the oven at 200CTo make the pastry, sieve the flour and salt into the bowl then using you fingers rub the butter into the flour until you have a fine breadcrumb like mixture.Add the water into the flour, and mix until you have a smooth dough. It should be an even colour and the right consistency to rollSplit the dough in half and wrap in cling film and store in the fridge for at least half an hour. You can make the pastry the night before, but remove it from the fridge 20 minutes before you roll it outFor the filling, slice the apple into thin wedges and mix in the cinnamon, brown sugar, nutmeg and lemon juice till all the pieces are evenly covered.Grease your baking tin and now we roll out the pastry. Softly knead the dough then gently roll it out until it is big enough to cover the baking tin and overlap the edges.Arrange your apple sliced evenly over the dough then sprinkle with some brown sugar.Roll out the last half of the pastry (I like to sprinkle a little cinnamon into the top while I roll)Place the top of the pastry over the dish, and wet the edges so the top layer and bottom layer stick together.Brush the pastry with a beaten egg then put it in the oven for 20-30 minutes until the crust is golden brown.Let it rest for 15 minutes then enjoy with a side of ice cream or cream.
