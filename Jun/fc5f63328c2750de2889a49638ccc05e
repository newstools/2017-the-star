Elderly women who performed at Madaraka Celebrations in Nyeri spent Thursday night in the cold in protest against non-payment.The women from Nyeri's 25 sub counties accused Governor Samuel Wamathai of neglecting them after their performance at Kabiruini grounds."There are dancers who camped at the showground the whole night after county officials gave them Sh500 for dancing for the President," a resident told The Star.The resident said the women were promised Sh1,000 per day for six days.Another said: "They have threatened to stop dancing since their marriages and kids have been affected."Central regional coordinator Anne Ng'etich was seen addressing the women on Friday morning.Ng'etich asked them to be patient noting the government will fulfill its promise."I can give you my number in case you have any more questions but for now you need to go back home and get some rest," she said.
