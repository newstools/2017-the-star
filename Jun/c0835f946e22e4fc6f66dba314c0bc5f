Trade CS Adan Mohamed has said the &ldquo;Buy Kenyan, Build Kenya&rdquo; policy has the potential to create 100,000 new jobs in the clothing industry from the 179,000 employed. Speaking in Nyeri on Monday during a three-day exhibition, the CS said he expects exports will establish a new supply chain. &ldquo;Sustaining the initiative means that clothes dealers in the Mt Kenya region can buy clothes from EPZ firms for sale in the region, creating an alternative business avenue,&rdquo; Mohamed said.The government has allowed textile and apparel firms in Export Promotion Zones to sell up to 20 per cent of their products to Kenyan consumers tax-free.Kenyans will access quality clothes for export for as little as between Sh100 and Sh600 for items that retail at Sh 6,000 in the global markets. The next exhibition will be held in Eldoret, followed by Meru editions, before heading back to Nairobi.
