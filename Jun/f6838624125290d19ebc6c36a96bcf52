Prominent Eldoret politician-cum-farmer Jackson Kibor yesterday testified in court for the second time, insisting he wants a quick divorce from his second wife Josephine Jepkoech after 51 years. The case has been adjourned 10 times. Kibor, 86, filed for divorce a year ago, accusing his wife of desertion, cruelty, denial of conjugal rights and interfering with his ownership of 800 acres in Kipkabus, Uasin Gishu county. He denied he wants to leave Josephine because she had placed a caveat on land he wanted to sell. Kibor told principal magistate Charles Obulutsa, “I have said I don’t want her because she travelled to Canada to live with her children severally abandoning me and without my authority.” Kibor says he has not spent time with Jepkoech for more than 30 years. He wants their marriage certificate issued in 1965 cancelled. Jepkoech’s lawyer Amos Magut asked Kibor if his wife had at any time chased him away when he went to visit her, and if she denied him his conjugal rights. He said, “If you have one wife then don’t ask me about those things you are talking about. If I go to one house and I am not welcomed even though the home is mine, I will simply go to the other home.” Kibor’s first wife Mary is deceased, and Yunita is his third wife. Jepkoech was not in court, but is opposed to the divorce. She says they had lived happily and she does not understand why Kibor is frustrating her. She denied chasing him away from their Kipkabus farm. Magut produced three letters written in Kalenjin, which Kibor allegedly sent to Jepkoech instructing her on issues to do with their farm. She wants them used as evidence she was taking orders from Kibor. He denied he’s the author. Hearing continues on June 28.
