Gor Mahia have entered their name in the books of history after winning the inaugural Sportpesa Super Cup tournament by thrashing their fierce rivals AFC Leopards 3-0 in the finals staged at Uhuru Stadium, Dar es Salaam.Being their 83rd meeting, the duo descended for the tie on a mission to walk away with the Sh3m cash prize, the four kilogram trophy among other individual accolades.The win saw the 15 time Kenyan Premier League winners finish the tournament on a one hundred percent win record.The intensity of the derby was felt in the second minute of the game with Leopards goalkeeper Ian Otieno calling for medical assistance after pulling a muscle while trying to pull a save. Leopards seemed shaky allowing Gor to settle in the game early which they dominated well but could not find the back of the net.After a barren first half, Timothy Otieno ran on the left wing, evading a number of tackles, to slot in the opener in the 59th minute sparking wild celebrations from the Green Army, who had traveled to the Tanzanian capital. Desperate for an equaliser,Leopards staged a counter-offensive game through Ramadhan Yakub and Bernard Mang&rsquo;oli but their efforts did not ease past Gor&rsquo;s midfield trio of Philemon Otieno, Francis Kahata and Kenneth Muguna.A bad tackle by Yakub on Innocent Wafula in the 66th minute was cautioned slowing the Ugandan&rsquo;s aggressiveness in the midfield and giving his opponents more composure which gave them more tempo in creating chances.Moments later, Otieno was ejected paving way for impressive youngster, Oliver Maloba, in the 72nd minute. The ex-Nairobi City Stars player made instantaneous impact as he doubled Gor Mahia&rsquo;s lead in the 76th minute after tapping in George &lsquo;Blackberry&rsquo; Odhiambo&rsquo;s cross past an advancing Otieno.Leopards would have pulled one back a minute later but Vincent Oburu&rsquo;s strike went straight to the hands of stand-in goalkeeper Peter Odhiambo.A fresh from holiday Gor Mahia head coach Ze Maria introduced Anthony Mbugua for Kenneth Muguna in the 80th minute in a bid to assist in safeguarding the lead as Leopards opposite number, Dorian Marin, rested his skipper Bernard Mang&rsquo;oli for Whyvonne Isuza.A poor call by the referee in the 83rd minute was met with protest by Gor&rsquo;s deputy head coach Zedekiah Otieno, who was sent to the stands.Ex-Leopards old boy John Ndirangu replaced Innocent Wafula in the 84th minute as Amos Nondi came in for George Odhiambo. The introduction of Ndirangu bore fruits in the 90+1 minute as his long range shot sailed past the goal-line making it 3-0.The win not only guarantees K&rsquo;Ogalo the cash prize, but also a chance to play English Premier League side Everton FC in a friendly match. Meddie Kagere clinched the golden boot after topping the score charts of three goals.His stopper, Odhiambo walked away with the Golden Glove after finishing the tournament without conceding a goal in the tournament.
