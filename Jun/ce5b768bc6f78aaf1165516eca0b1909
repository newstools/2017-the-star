M-Pesa services will be disrupted for 12 hours mid next month to allow for a changeover to a new platform, Safaricom announced yesterday. This is the first major upgrade since the system was transferrred to Kenya in 2015. The company said the mobile money platform is undergoing a three-week upgrade leading to two other temporary outage of the services. The first of that outage started this morning when all services were unavailable between 1.00am and 3.00am. Another disruption will affect International Money Transfer, KCB-M-Pesa, M-Shwari and M-Kesho services at the same time on July 5. &ldquo;Ten years ago, we began the journey of M-PESA by focusing on our customers&rsquo; need to send money home. Since then, we have experienced tremendous growth as the platform has grown to provide even more value to the ecosystem,&rdquo; chief executive Bob Collymore said in a statement yesterday. &ldquo;This upgrade paves the way for the next phase of M-PESA and will enable the service deliver even more value for our customers and partners.&rdquo; The upgrade will lead to an increase in partners offering their services on the enhanced M-Pesa platform through a new set of Application Programme Interface that will simplify the process of integration into M-Pesa.
