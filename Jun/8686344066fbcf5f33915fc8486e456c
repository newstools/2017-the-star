IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati yesterday warned parties that if the top nominee on the submitted list on nominees will not be a woman, it will be rejected. Addressing women aspirants in Nairobi, he said the party lists, which are to be submitted to the commission by Saturday, must comply with all laws. “The commission is working on regulations to ensure the role of women is enforced on the party lists and we have said if a party brings a list ,the first name should be a woman before any other name,” Chebukati said . He continued, “This is in line with the directions given by the court in 2013 in a case between the Gender and Equality Commission versus the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission.”
