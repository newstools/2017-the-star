Nyeri governor candidate Thuo Mathenge has threatened to sue the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission if it stops him from running for election.The independent is among 19 candidates whom the EACC says should be barred from holding public office over integrity issues.Mathenge (pictured) said despite being cleared by the IEBC, having a degree and a certificate of good conduct, the EACC has continued to poke holes in his dream of becoming governor. He accused it of a witch-hunt.Mathenge was speaking in Chaka on Tuesday.&ldquo;I have all the necessary documents and for the EACC to say that it is investigating me, I wonder why,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;It seems it is working on behalf of another person. This is maligning my name and I will not hesitate to take them to court since this is defamation.&rdquo;
