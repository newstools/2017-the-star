Kiambu Governor William Kabogo has reignited the 2022 presidential election debate pitting him and Deputy President William Ruto.He said Mt Kenya region will not automatically vote DP Ruto in 2022 adding that the decision on who will become president after Uhuru rests with the people.The governor accused the DP of using Ferdinand Waititu to stop him from pursuing his (Kabogo) ambitions after President Uhuru Kenyatta leaves office."I had said it a while back and I will say it again. My main aim is to make the lives of Kenyans better but I am being fought by those who want to be President in 2022.""We will not elect anyone in 2022 unless we see the work done. I am not going to deputise anyone. He can actually also be my deputy," Kabogo said.The county chief told Jubilee leaders that the six-piece vote push ahead of the August 8 general election will backfire."Ruto has spoiled for President Uhuru Kenyatta by urging residents to only vote for the party's nominees."He told residents that a vote for Waititu will be a vote for the DP describing his key challenger as a "Ruto project"."It is okay if he is told this because Ruto is splitting Uhuru's votes," the governor said adding that he met 20 bloggers who said they will vote for Abduba Dida.Dida is among the eight candidates eying the presidency in August.Kabogo further said that the suffering brought about by the Kenyatta and Odinga dynasties will come to an end after the scheduled poll."Kenya will move on. I will, therefore, not keep quiet to the detriment of our people," he added.It was not the first time that Kabogo spoke of Ruto's 2022 presidential bid. In June 2016, the governor said Mt Kenya voting bloc does not guarantee support for the DP in 2022.He said this was since he (Kabogo) was also intending to be in the race of the top seat.A section of leaders from Central and Rift Valley regions accused him of pushing for his selfish interests forcing him to apologise.[VIDEO] Kabogo apologises to Ruto over 2022 presidential bid remarks
