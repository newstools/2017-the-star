New AFC Leopards coach Dorin Marin from Romania arrived in the country last week and will soon be unveiled to take over from Stewart Hall.Marin is with the club in Tanzania, where Leopards are taking part in the inaugural edition of the Sportpesa Super Cup. Marin will have an onerous task of finding out how a Leopards squad that is teeming with talent find themselves closer to the relegation zone.With the transfer window still open, the tactician has the opportunity to strengthen the team with the kind of players he believes will fit into his football philosophy although this will be subject to the availability of funds. Already, Leopards have confirmed that exciting Uganda Cranes&rsquo; midfielder Keziron Kizito will be joining them.Kizito, formerly of Ugandan club Vipers, has agreed to a two-year contract with Leopards. Club chairman Dan Mule revealed on the Kenyan Premier League official portal that they are targeting four more experienced players in the June transfer window that opens on Thursday.&ldquo;The only thing that remains for now is to register him (Kizito) with the Kenyan Premier League Limited. Otherwise, we have agreed on all terms and he has even signed a contract,&rdquo; said Mule.&ldquo;In the next three weeks, we shall be very busy because we have to revive the team and help the coaches achieve good results. We want to bring in more experienced players because this has severely been lacking in our squad this season.&rdquo;&ldquo;The areas we want to reinforce are goal keeping and midfield and maybe get one good defender. Once we have good players in the positions, then we can sit back and watch,&rdquo; Mule said.
