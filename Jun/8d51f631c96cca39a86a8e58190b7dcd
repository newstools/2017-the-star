Senators Chris Obure (Kisii) and Kennedy Okong’o (Nyamira, pictured) are campaigning door-to-door to become governors. Obure is running for Kisii governor on the JP ticket, while Okong’o wants to become Nyamira governor on the National Liberal Party ticket. While their opponents hold rallies, the two have opted for “silent campaigns” by holding impromptu rallies. Obure uses a Toyota Probox in his campaigns and has traversed all the nine constituencies. He seeks to defeat James Ongwae of ODM. South Mugirango MP Manson Nyamweya is also in the race, alongside seven others. Okong’o faces Governor John Nyagarama (ODM), West Mugirango James Gesami (Independent), former Kitutu Masaba MPs Walter Nyambati (JP) and Mwancha Okioma (PDP).
