Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago met key Kikuyu community leaders in Eldoret but no agreement was reached to end his feud with tycoon Bundotich Kiprop. Kiprop, known as Buzeki, lost to Mandago in the Jubilee primary, and is running against him as an independent. He poses a big problem for Mandago and refuses to step aside. Kiambu JP governor candidate Ferdinand Waititu, known as Baba Yao, is said to have called the meeting. It was meant to call a truce betweenthe leaders who have been arguing over the Kikuyu community&rsquo;s support for Buzeki. Mandago&rsquo;s allies &ndash; Nandi Hills MPAlfred Keter and Oscar Sudi of Kapseret - last week threatened to mobilise Kalenjins to support NASA if Kikuyus vote for Buzeki. The meeting was attended by MCAs Peter Chomba (Huruma) and Francis Muya of Langas, and several elders led by businessman Joseph Keriri. More than 10 Kikuyu leaders attended, including including Uasin Gishu Water executive Mary Njogu. &ldquo;We met but nothing was agreed,&rdquo; Chomba said. He saidPresident Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto should let residents elect a leader of their choice. Last week, Uhuru at White Castle Hotel, Eldoret, yielded to pressure, and even spoke Kikuyu to urge his community to coexist with Kalenjins to ensure peace. He urged Kikuyus to &ldquo;work with the majority&rdquo;. Buzeki has refused to back out of the race. He has launched a major campaign and held a big rally yesterday at Munyaka market outside Eldoret. This while Uhuru was meeting Jubilee candidates at State Lodge. Buzeki has called Mandago &ldquo;a Ruto project who stands for nothing&rdquo;. The DP Ruto said Mandago won the primary and deserves to be supported by all losers, including Buzeki. He urged Buzeki to back out.
