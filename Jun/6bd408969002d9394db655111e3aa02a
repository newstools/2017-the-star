An order barring the anti-graft agency from investigating Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero should be reversed so his accounts are examined, the Director of Public Prosecutions has said. In documents filed by lawyer Ashimosi Sitambasi, DPP Keriako Tobiko says Kidero has not demonstrated a good case to warrant the protection or that a probe would violate the Constitution or his rights.He was responding to a suit filed by the governor, challenging investigation of his personal accounts.The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission wanted to investigate transactions in Kidero&rsquo;s seven bank accounts that contain Sh1 billion.The accounts are held at the Standard Chartered Bank (US dollars), Commercial Bank of Africa (pounds Sterling) and his foundation&rsquo;s Family Bank account.The probe was initiated over suspicion the governor and his wife Susan, who filed a similar case, have been diverting public funds. They deny the claims.
