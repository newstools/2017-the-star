Kajiado Governor David Nkedianye has denied hiring goons to burn down an incinerator. The premises belonging to Environmental and Combustion Consultants was raided on March 16. The claim by the locals during the demo was that the smoke from the plant was a health hazard. Nkedianye appeared before Justice George Odunga on Wednesday to show cause why he should not be committed to civil jail for ignoring a court order. The Governor said he only went to the plant after being told residents had threatened to break in. Nkedianye told the court the only reason he went to the plant was to avert its destruction. The case will be mentioned on July 27.
