Lamu West MP Julius Ndegwa has condemned the shooting of two civilians by police on Friday during protests outside the Lamu law courts.Mohamed Yusuf, 40, was shot in the stomach and Abdulatif Abdalla, 16, was shot in the head. They are in hospital.The two were said to be among the youths who allegedly wanted to free a convict who had been handed a 20-year jail sentence for drug peddling.Two officers were also injured during the scuffle. The youths are said to have attacked the officers with stones, knives and rungus.Ndegwa yesterday criticised police for using excessive force to disperse the rioters. &ldquo;The security should look into the matter. There is need to ascertain if any officer misused their weapon after which the law must follow its due course. They should have used reasonable force. I don&rsquo;t see what warranted them to open fire on these people,&rdquo; he said.
