The Nyanza region Airtel Rising Stars championships start today with East Africa secondary schools boys&rsquo; soccer champions Barding High from Siaya targeting to defend their title.Yesterday, Barding coach Thaddeus Wanjir exuded confidence of retaining the title. &ldquo;We have a relatively new side because only four players played for us at the nationals,&rdquo; said Wanjir. Barding face newcomers Gesero from Kisii County in the opening pool &lsquo;A&rsquo; game at Homa Bay Boys High School. In the other match, Kanga High School take on St. Paul&rsquo;s Ligisa from Homa Bay County.Commenting on the draw, Wanjir said: &ldquo;It looks easy on paper but it&rsquo;s a tough pool. Kanga have been to the regionals but Gesero and Ligisa are debutants and not easy teams to play against. However, my boys are prepared.&rdquo;Gesero lost in the Kisii County finals on Saturday against Moremani but latter were disqualified for fielding ineligible players, according to Kisii County Secondary Schools Sports Association secretary Geoffrey Nyantika. Gesero coach Evans Akenga said his team is ready for their opening match against Barding.&ldquo;This is pool of death but we are not afraid of any team. We played against Kanga and beat them at their home and we are looking forward for a re-match,&rdquo; said Akenga.Kisumu County champions St. Ignatius Royola Magadi&rsquo;s coach Derrick Oliech sounded a warning to his pool &lsquo;B&rsquo; opponents Ringa Boys, St Kizito Nyansiongo and Got Agulu from Siaya County. &ldquo;We want to top the pool so that we play the team number two from Pool &lsquo;A&rsquo;. We want fairness this time round and my boys are aiming at the nationals,&rdquo; he said.
