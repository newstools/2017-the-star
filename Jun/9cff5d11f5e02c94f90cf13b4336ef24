Knut Secretary General Wilson Sossion has accused the Salaries and Remuneration Commission of impeding salary talks.He said the salaries team 'acts as an agent of confusion' during negotiations between unions and the state on pay issues.Sossion, in a press statement on Friday, said the Sarah Serem team has abandoned its core duty and responsibility."We shall from now henceforth contest presence of bodies that interfere with free negotiations such as SRC before the next round of negotiations".Sossion further reiterated that negotiations are a tripartite business involving employer, union and the government."There should be no other busy bodies that end up creating obstacles to the detriment of workers," he said.The teachers union wants the next CBA negotiated and signed in line with ILO conventions and standards.Read: Knut, TSC sign CBA to end perennial strikes, scrap off P1 entry gradeAlso read: TSC to spend Sh54 billion on CBA between Knut, KuppetHe announced that TSC has finally agreed to implement the Sh 54 billion teacher's CBA it signed with KNUT on October 25, 2016.Sossion said the CBA, whose Implementation Matrix has been agreed upon, will facilitate structured and constructive dialogues to avert future teachers strikes."Though we agree that the CBA deal will be implemented in phases, we call on the employer to further endeavor to shorten the period.""We are prepared to amend the CBA to accommodate such positive changes," Sossion said.He said a reasonable CBA should be implemented in two years as anything beyond 24 months contravenes International Labour Organization statutes."This is also bound to affect workers. More so, TSC should start preparing to engage KNUT for the next CBA this time round in a friendlier manner than it has been the case previously." The union also asked TSC to hire more teachers to address Curriculum Based Establishment (CEB).Sossion said this is already worrying parents as pupils/students presently in majority of schools are not getting quality education as required.He maintained that the proposed hiring of 5,000 teachers to address teacher shortfall in 21,718 Primary schools and 7,686 Secondary schools is laughable.Knut asked TSC CEO Nancy Macharia to fast track and address all pending cases of promotions with new higher qualifications before the general elections.
