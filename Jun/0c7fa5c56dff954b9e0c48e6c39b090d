Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho has accused the Inspector General of Police, the Attorney General, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the CID of crafting a scheme to forge his documents, and then blame it on him to justify forgery allegations against him.The governor said the state agencies may have forged his academic certificates to unjustly accuse him.Police had launched investigations on Joho for allegedly forging his secondary school certificates, which he used to seek admission to the University of Nairobi.Joho denied being the owner of a result slip, which indicates he attained C-plus in the 1992&rsquo;s KCSE exam results.Joho, popularly known as Sultan, stood his ground, saying he has never at anyone&rsquo;s time said he sat the exam.He maintained he is a stranger to the documents allegedly obtained from the university.Joho has in the past publicly admitted he scored D-minus, which he attributed to his poor background.The governor said the university had in 2014 conducted independent investigations and found no reasonable ground to indict him for any wrongdoing.He said the IG, CID, the DPP and the AG have been seeking to &ldquo;fraudulently create a factual foundation needed to guarantee a criminal prosecution against me&rdquo;. He told the court it is not the first time Janet Mbete, who lodged complaints against him, to do so.Joho said she first challenged his academic certificates in 2013, just after his election.Mbete filed a petition at the High Court challenging authenticity of Joho&rsquo;s degree.However, the High court dismissed her application and ordered her to first file a statement with police, who would then investigate the allegations.Joho told the court the CID investigated him and vindicated him.He said fresh complaints by Mbete have confirmed his fears that his case is driven by malice, citing abuse of the process.Joho said the CID should have revealed the identity of the complainant earlier, but did not do so because it would have exposed their ulterior motive.
