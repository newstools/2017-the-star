Two people are nursing gunshot wounds at the Lamu King Fahd Hospital after they were injured during a battle between police and youths outside the Lamu law courts on Friday evening.Mohamed Yusuf, 40, was shot in the stomach and Abdulatif Abdalla, 16, shot in the head.They are said to have been among a group of youths who engaged police as they ferried a convict from the law courts at 6pm.The incident also left two police officers nursing injuries.The youths were said to have been planning to whisk away their &ldquo;friend&rdquo;, a proven notorious drug peddler, who had just been handed a 20-year sentence in jail by resident magistrate Njeri Thuku.Lamu county commissioner Joseph Kanyiri said police had to use force to disperse the rioting youths, who were pelting the officers with stones.The youths are said to have attacked the police using knives and rungus with their sole mission being to rescue the convict. Kanyiri said, however, things got worse when the family of the convict joined hands with the youths and attempted to burn down the court.
