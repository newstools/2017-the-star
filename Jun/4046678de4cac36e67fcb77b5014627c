St Francis Cheptarit stormed to the handball semi finals of the ongoing national secondary school Term 2A games thanks to a 24-18 win against Utithi. The Rift Valley outfit extended their good run having humiliated Wajir Girls 52-0 in their opening tie on Tuesday.Against Utithi, Aureria Jebet netted 12 goals supported by Daisy Kiplagat (9), Mario Jeptoo (2) and Nancy Jepchumba (1) scored for St. Francis. Despite the impressive run, St. Francis head coach Hillary Rop remained coy of their chances, pin-pointing Moi Girls Kamusinga (whom they face today) and Sega Girls from Nyanza as their biggest challengers going forward. &ldquo;We have enough experience and that&rsquo;s why we have been able to counter tough opponents,&rdquo; said Rop, whose side has been to the national games six times.. &ldquo;Today (yesterday) we faced a team we have never played against but our mastery of the game helped us through.&rdquo; Utithi&rsquo;s coach Mark Mutuko said their attack was blunt. &ldquo;We advanced poorly leaving loopholes for our opponents to exploit,&rdquo; said Mutuko, whose side is on exit after losing two games, their first being a narrow 28-30 defeat to Moi. They will face Wajir Girls in their last preliminary match today. Meanwhile, Voi New White House beat Kahuho Central 26-16. Neema Nzai (13 ), Mercy Kariuki (5), Paul Mary (3), Mapenzi Naomi (3) and Telesia Meshak (2) emerged top scorers for the coastal outfit.
