ANC is demanding a share of the Mombasa county seats. National chairman Kelvin Lunani, who was cleared to run for Nyali MP by the IEBC on Thursday, said their inspired NASA, has at least 80,000 supporters in Mombasa but has been sidelined. NASA is made up of ANC, ODM, Wiper, Ford Kenya and Chama Cha Mashinani. ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi will be Premier Cabinet Secretary under the NASA administration, if the opposition wins. &ldquo;ANC is the party that gave birth to NASA. ANC demands respect and a share of Mombasa seats,&rdquo; Lunani said. &ldquo;We sacrificed the presidency. Here in Mombasa, ANC sacrificed the governor and senator seats. We demand our partners return a hand of good will.&rdquo; He spoke at the Mombasa Industrial Training Institute in Nyali. &ldquo;The NASA agreement requires that we negotiate seats at county level. Nairobi did it &mdash; Why not Mombasa?&rdquo; Lunani asked.
