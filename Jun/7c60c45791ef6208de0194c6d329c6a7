There is something wonderfully soothing about baking. I know that if I add butter, flour, eggs and sugar in just the right amount, I have the basis for anything from a cake to cookies. Nothing beats the smell of fresh bread just out of the oven, and I&rsquo;m not sure I completely trust anyone who can resist warm gooey chocolate brownies! Cheesecake, however holds a very special place in my heart. It was the first thing I ever attempted to make as teenager and it&rsquo;s my go to dessert that&rsquo;s guaranteed to be a hit at any dinner party. This recipe is a result of a few years of trial and error, combining recipes I&rsquo;ve found, and trying different combinations of flavours. It&rsquo;s a fairly easy recipe to follow, and all the ingredients are very easily found. So, without any further delay, here is my &ldquo;White and Dark chocolate cheesecake.&rdquo;IngredientsCrust150 g of crushed digestive biscuits50 g of Gingernut biscuits80g butter2tbsp SugarFilling4 Packs of cream cheese1tbsp of vanilla1tbsp of ground nutmeg4 eggs150 g of white granulated sugarGanache250g of good quality dark chocolate250g of white chocolate500ml of double cream1tbsp of Rum (optional)MethodGanache:Once the cheesecake is ready, remove it from the oven and let it cool.

Then ladle the white chocolate over the top of it using a knife or to mix it together to get a marbling effect. Let it set and cool completely and you can add some shaved chocolate over the top for decoration, or some crushed up gingernut cookies for a little crunch.And There you have it, a relatively easy but very delicious cheesecake that you&rsquo;re friends will love you for!
