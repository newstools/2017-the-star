The estranged wife of incoming Lesotho Prime Minister Thomas Thabane has been shot dead two days before his inauguration. Lipolelo Thabane, 58, was travelling home with a friend when both women where shot by an unknown assailant, the police say. The police add the motive is unknown and an investigation is continuing. The couple had been living separately since 2012 and filed for divorce which hasn't been granted yet. She won a court case against her husband during his first stint as
prime minister affirming her position as Lesotho's first lady instead of
his youngest wife, Liabiloe Thabane, the AFP news agency reports. Samonyane
Ntsekele, the secretary general of Mr Thabane's All Basotho Convention
party, told AFP that Mr Thabane was devastated by the shooting. "Everyone is traumatised by these developments," he said. The election took place earlier this month and was the third election in three years because of a bitter power-struggle. He is due to be sworn in on Friday.
