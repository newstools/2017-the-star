Embu Governor Martin Wambora has been criticised for allegedly not having the right priorities for the county, while Senator Lenny Kivuti has been slammed for failing to protect Embu.Governor Wambora, the front-runner and Jubilee candidate, has launched more than 500 major projects during his term. But Embu PNU governor aspirant Kithinji Kiragu and his running mate Elias Kathiga on Sunday claimed some of these projects were not a priority.They claimed that Wambora launched the Embu town beautification programme before tarmacking murram streets in the town.However, Governor Wambora has already tarmacked most major roads in Embu town.Speaking at Kithimu town on Sunday during a campaign rally, Kiragu said Wambora has not been implementing projects that can empower families and uplift the standard of living.&ldquo;A governor should teach people how to fish by empowering them through programmes that will enable every person to get comfortable earnings and this has not been happening in Embu,&rdquo; Kiragu said.He said he is the best bet for governor.Kathiga said Kivuti has also been unable to perform his oversight role.&ldquo;The county has received billions [of shillings] from the national government in the last four years, which cannot be accounted for ... Kivuti has been doing nothing to protect the county,&rdquo; he alleged.Embu was last year named the best county in Kenya in health management and the best in energy during the counties&rsquo; awards.Recent polls also show Wambora would retain his seat if polls were held today, with Kivuti coming second and Kiragu third.Kiragu and Kathiga also accused the county of discriminating against the majority Manyatta constituents in senior appointments.The PNU candidate argued that by virtue of being the largest area in population, Manyatta should have the most appointments in the county government, as the positions should be shared equitably.He alleged that the community has been forgotten and remained out in the cold throughout Wambora&rsquo;s governance.Kiragu asked residents to reject Wambora and Kivuti and elect him as the next governor.He promised to share appointments in his government equitably.
