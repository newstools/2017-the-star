Fierce rivals Gor Mahia and AFC Leopards reignite their antagonism tomorrow when they descend on the Uhuru Stadium, Dar es Salaam, for the SportPesa Super Cup final.Deemed as the most successful clubs in Kenya, with a vast fan base and a rich past,the two sailed to the finals by eliminating Nakuru All Stars and Tanzanian powerhouse Yanga.The last time the two teams met in a Kenyan Premier League match a month ago, Gor scored three unanswered goals with the man behind Leopards&rsquo; success in the semi finals Ian Otieno termed the villain for letting in &lsquo;easy goals&rsquo;. The clash draws the superiority lines in the country but the winner of the clash will reap, not only regional respect, but also a Sh3m cash prize. The winners are also lined up for a friendly match against English Premier League side Everton. Leopards who have so far scored a sole goal in open play and nine from the spot will bank their hopes in the stout Ghananian forward Gilbert Fiamenyo and his lanky twin striker Vincent Oburu for goals as skipper Bernard Mang&rsquo;oli man the midfield alongside Ramadhan Yakub. Dreaded Ugandan Allan Kateregga and Duncan Otieno will be flying high on the flanks. Abdalla Salim will command the defence with Ian Otieno or Gabriel Andika between the sticks. Romanian tactician Dorian Marin, who took over the reigns from his assistant Dennis Kitambi will be in charge, in a match that could indicate the direction that he cherishes to follow at the Den.Ugandan-born Rwandese striker Meddie Kagere will be seeking to extend his goal-scoring form in the finals and assist his team to win the cup in addition to clinching the Golden Boot. George Odhiambo &lsquo;Blackberry&rsquo; and an impressive Oliver Maloba are expected to be deployed in the flanks as Francis Kahata and Kenneth Muguna will dictate the midfield. The absence of Musa Mohammed means Joash Onyango and Harun Shakava will boss the back line with Peter Odhiambo in the goal.
