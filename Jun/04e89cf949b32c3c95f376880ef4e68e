A matatu branded 'Covfefe' sparked conversation by KOT on Monday, many saying Kenyans are very creative.The matatu was spotted on the streets of Nairobi, weeks after US President Donald Trump's tweet.&ldquo;Despite the constant negative press covfefe," the controversial leader known for outrageous tweets wrote.The word was close to breaking the internet on the morning of May 31. It was an apparent typo in a tweet by Trump, and internet users mocked him mercilessly.His 31 million followers were equally baffled and slightly concerned. The tweet had been active on Trump&rsquo;s account without comment or clarification overnight and was not deleted until shortly before 6am the following morning.A user identified as Bob&rlm; Njogu tagged Trump in his tweet saying the matatu was named after his "weird word".James Murua&rlm; said: "Kenyan matatu makers already have Covfefe."Venturesome&rlm; Munyoki said: "This ninja [Donald Trump] may faint after realising how quick Kenyans have 'covfefed' a matatu [sic]."James Karimi said a 'poor' matatu has become the victim of Trump's 'madness" while George Waithaka&rlm; said "This is Kenya. We don't disappoint with creativity."Khedira said: "The trump version of coffee #Covfefe is in Kenya thanks to the geniuses of matatu industry."Others wanted to know the route the matatu plies, perhaps an indication its owners had achieved their marketing goal.Buru Buru and Rongai were some of the possibilities. Matatus that go to these areas are known for being 'discos on wheels'.White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer was asked by journalists at that day's daily briefing what the tweet meant.Spicer provoked incredulity from the assembled media as he replied: "The president and a small group of people know exactly what he meant."Although it seems likely the word Trump was reaching for was "coverage", social media users have been trying to guess other alternatives or motivations.Others deliberated on the pronunciation and wondered why no aides had stepped in to alert him to the mistake.Google Translate recognised the word as Samoan, though could offer no English translation. A BBC reader has written in to debunk any suggestion that the president is a secret Samoan speaker. Among many other reasons for this, the language does not even have a letter C.
