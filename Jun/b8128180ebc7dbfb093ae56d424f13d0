The &ldquo;Trump Dollar&rdquo; has become a &ldquo;Chump Trade&rdquo; as the dollar gets sold off across the board.Kenya announced it has suspended its early oil export plan. It was always a bit of a PR stunt and with oil below $50.00 a barrel, it would not have received any positive PR traction and might even have created a negative feedback loop.The Nairobi All Share closed lower for the second session and closed -0.71% at 153.22.The All Share has corrected -1.504% over two sessions and since closing at a 23-month high.

Counter-intuitively, it speaks to EABL&rsquo;s muscle that they can announce a $150m investment without having to have locked up the funds.EABL edged +0.39% higher to close at 260.00 on light volume of 8,300 shares.
