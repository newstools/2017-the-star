Wajir Governor Ahmed Abdullahi yesterday denied that he was summoned by the Senate Finance committee.Through his press officer Ahmed Diriye, the governor said the allegations on social media are false and misleading. &ldquo;Abdullahi is in Nairobi to follow up on the Wajir sewage and sanitation project which is in its final stage.&ldquo;The Senate is on adjournment and has not, in any way, invited nor summoned Wajir leadership,&rdquo; reads a press statement issued in Wajir town on Friday. Mandera Senator Billow Kerrow, who is also the Senate Finance Committee chairman, spoke to the Star on the phone saying, &ldquo;I have been out of the country for a while. But I don&rsquo;t think he was summoned and if he did, I would have been notified.&rdquo;The claim was rubbished by the Senior deputy clerk of the Senate, Consolata Waithera, who said, &ldquo;We do not have the record of his summons in our files and the committee has not notified us of such.&rdquo; A post on wajironline.com claimed Abdullahi had been summoned by the Senate to respond to finance queries.&ldquo;The county leadership has not been summoned by any committee, whether parliamentary or senatorial, and our people should treat the propaganda with the contempt it deserves,&rdquo; the statement from Diriye said.Meanwhile, Wajir governor aspirants continue to seek votes ahead of the August polls. Abdullahi has been meeting local clans to woo them. However, each clan has been receptive to all contestants, further complicating political matters.
