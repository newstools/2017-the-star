The Nairobi Hospital yesterday announced plans to set up a satellite out-patient clinic in Athi River. The new satellite clinic, which will be housed at the Crystal Rivers Mall, has been opened due to increased demand for healthcare in Machakos couunty. Chief executive Gordon Odundo said in a statement that the hospital’s new facility was part of the medical service provider’s corporate strategic drive geared at expanding from Nairobi. “We also recognise that there is latent demand for a quality medical facility along Mombasa Road where we expect our clinic to annually serve at least half a million residents of the area,” Odundo said. The 24-hour satellite clinic is set to offer advanced laboratory and radiology services with CT scanning, among other services.
