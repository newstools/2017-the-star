The business community has called on the government to interrogate the cost of elections to the economy as campaigns hit the fever pitch.According to the National Chamber of Commerce and Industry, seven out of last 10 elections have led to a slowdown in economic growth by an average of 60 per cent. Addressing the press yesterday during a meeting with political parties, KNCCI national chairman Kiprono Kittony said the political class usually spend a lot of cash to bribe voters and buy campaign materials, hence forced to replenish it once they get into the office.&ldquo;The first order of business that they have when they get elected is replenishing their coffers. As a country, we need to find a way of reigning in the cost of elections if we want to do away with impunity and corruption,&rdquo; Kittony said. He noted that the counties are also releasing cash to preferred suppliers at the expense of small businesses who will have to wait until later in the year to be paid. &ldquo;Delayed payments contribute to the culture of corruption thus affecting businesses, enjoying the provision of services and delaying their payments by 200 days is uncalled for,&rdquo; he added.According to Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, 2.2 million small and medium enterprises closed in the last five years with most of them closing in 2015 due to delayed payments. Suppliers are currently seeking payment of Sh160 billion owed to suppliers by the government. To mitigate this, the KNCCI presented a business position paper to the parties which call for stronger ideologies to be underpinned in their manifestos.The paper has identified six cross-cutting issues affecting the business community. They include overlapping mandate between national and county governments that leads to double taxation,insecurity and delayed payments by county governments to businesses.
