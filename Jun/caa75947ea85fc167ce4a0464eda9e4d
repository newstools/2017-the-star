Kenya Simbas coach Jerome Paarwater believes there is room for improvement in his charges following a disappointing 33-all draw against Uganda in a Africa Gold Cup-cum Elgon Cup match at the RFUEA grounds on Saturday.And despite winning the Elgon Cup on aggregate score of 56-51, having won the first leg 23-18 in Kampala to bag their 10th victory, several fans left the RFUEA ground a dejected lot after a &lsquo;shambolic display&rsquo; by the Kenya Simbas.Paarwater, whose charges face Tunisia in a fortnight, said defensive lapses ares still evident in the side and the inability to close-out matches came to haunt Kenya in the final 20 minutes of this epic encounter.&ldquo;Our defense was not up to par in both halves as we had several missed tackles which saw the Ugandans stage a comeback. We must go back to the drawing board and try to change all that,&rdquo; said Paarwater.The South African tactician said the boys mental strength must improve against tougher opponents.&ldquo;We saw in the Germany game we had lapses in concentration in the final 10 minutes and it&rsquo;s something the technical bench and I must improve ahead of matches against Tunisia, Senegal, Zimababwe and holders Namibia&rdquo; he added.When asked if Kenya was stagnating and regressing, Paarwater said: &ldquo;Credit to Uganda. They came to play and gave us a stern examination so they are a team we will not write off and must step up and play better.&rdquo;Uganda skipper Marvin Odongo was disappointed with the result after taking the lead with less than five minutes to go. &ldquo;My boys came to play. We just could not execute our defensive tactics in the final minutes. I am disappointed. We had Kenya on the ropes in the final minutes and if we had defended well, we would have won the match.
