The National Super Alliance manifestos launched yesterday is good for Kenyans since it will transform lives and improve the economy, an ODM official in Busia county has said.Speaking to the Star in Funyula town, Busia, yesterday, Bwiri ODM coordinator Thomas Buluma said apart from empowering the people economically through more jobs, the NASA manifesto will prioritise education to ensure all children access education.The ODM official said the Jubilee administration should not underrate the opposition because it is the same that fought for pluralism that eventually saved Kenyans from &ldquo;a single-party state dictatorial regime&rdquo;.&ldquo;The Jubilee administration should stop saying the opposition has nothing to offer Kenyans. I am confident that NASA will transform the lives of Kenyans should it take over the leadership of this country.&ldquo;Jubilee has failed to address pertinent issues affecting Kenyans, despite having adequate resources at its disposal,&rdquo; the coordinator said.He, however, urged all aspirants vying for elective seats in the August 8 General Election to maintain peace during campaigns to avoid confrontations that may lead to violence.Kiambu county Youth Affairs, Sports and Communications executive Machel Waikenda has said NASA has told Kenyans it will make the Mombasa-Nairobi road a dual carriage and extend this to Nakuru, Kericho and Kisumu.&ldquo;What the opposition is not telling Kenyans is that all this is part of Vision 2030 and is already being implemented by Jubilee,&rdquo; he said. Waikenda added that, there is a lot more that one can fault the NASA manifesto for but one thing is clear, it is a false promise to Kenyans. While NASA promises pension for the elderly, Jubilee has already put in place structures to ensure all Kenyans over 70 years get a monthly stipend and NHIF cover.
