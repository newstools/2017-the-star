It didn't happen and it will not happen.""We will ensure SGR is implemented in line with Vision 2030 to connect East African region," the ODM leader said.On youth unemployment, he said his team will deal with the bureaucracies in accessing Youth Funds."We will change all these. We will ensure every Kenyan accesses government services and jobs regardless of their tribe," he said.Kalonzo, who is Raila's running mate, said the NASA government will reach out to Kenyans in the diaspora because they are important.He said the National Treasury collects billion dollars from Kenyans in diaspora hence the need to engage them in the country's progress."We will engage foreign nations to ensure no Kenyan is molested," the Wiper leader said.He also pledged that their administration will revamp tourism which he pointed out "has died under the watch of their competitors".Kalonzo said they intend to source an electric train in line with the future needs of every developing nation."This country has suffered a lot under bad governance and this is the time for a better future."
