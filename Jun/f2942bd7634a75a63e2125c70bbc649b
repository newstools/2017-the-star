More than 70 pupils did not turn up for the second term at a Bungoma school. Teachers of Tembelela Primary in Kanduyi constituency said others have been absent for two weeks. Head Teacher Martin Juma said the absenteeism prompted the school to search for the pupils.The absenteeism is attributed to poverty, lack of food and parents&rsquo; negative attitude towards education. &ldquo;This level of absenteeism has never been seen before,&rdquo; Juma said yesterday. Out of the 70, 46 are boys and 24 are girls, spread from standard one to eight.The school has reported the problem to the chief who helped in tracing the parents. Some parents were unwilling to explain their children&rsquo;s whereabouts. One standard eight girl reported back to school.Parent Teachers Association chairman Leonard Makokha said many parents do not value education.He said poverty has forced many pupils to stay at home and look for food.Makokha said there have been cases of children seeking odd jobs from cane farmers.&ldquo;Children go to farms where cane is being harvested. They take the top part that is discarded and sell it to farmers who use it as animal feed,&rdquo; he said.
