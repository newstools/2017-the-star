The nurses&rsquo; strike at the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret entered its second day on Friday.About 1,000 nurses are demanding implementation of the Collective Bargaining Agreement signed in 2015 to increase their salaries and allowances.Hospital services have been disrupted and some are not offered.Chairman of the hospital nurses Union Kennedy Orangi said they have run out of patience. &ldquo;We had negotiated on monetary and non-monetary issues in the CBA. They have to do with working hours, promotion, and pension,&rdquo; he said.Hospital CEO Dr Wilson Aruasa was to meet union officials to respond to the nurses&rsquo; demands and chart the way forward. The hospital has about 1,000 nurses who are members of the Kenya National Union of Nurses.&ldquo;The CBA dispute is a court matter, but we will iron out all issues with them because we have to wait for the decision to be made by the Labour and Industrial Relations court,&rdquo;Aruasa said. He said the CBA was not registered at the Industrial Court as required by law before it&rsquo;s implemented.Orangi, however, said they will not return to work until the CBA, which he insists was registered in court, is implemented.&ldquo;We apologise to the public for the boycott because we are supposed to serve them. But it&rsquo;s a two-way traffic and we expect our employer and us to work together and compromise where necessary,&rdquo; he said. Orangi said they have compromised for a long time and now it&rsquo;s the hospital management&rsquo;s turn and the government to play their part.He said the nurses&rsquo; basic salary and allowances should be increased. Orangi said a lot of time has already been spent negotiating with the hospital. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important that they avoid such strikes through the implementation of the CBA as had been agreed,&rdquo; he said. However, doctors and medical students have been helping to provide care to patients seeking treatment in the hospital.
