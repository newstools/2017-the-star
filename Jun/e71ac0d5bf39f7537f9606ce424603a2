Labour CS Phyllis Kandie has called a conciliatory meeting with the CoG and the nurses union in a bid to end their strike.In a notice to the stakeholders on Wednesday, Kandie said the meeting will address the stalemate that have left several dead."It is clear from the current events that the parties have not [agreed] on the Collective Bargaining Agreement. In order to avoid unbearable suffering that Kenyans will undergo as a result of the strike, I am urgently inviting you for a conciliation meeting which will be chaired by the CS." On Monday, Council of Governors chairman Josephat Nanok (Turkana), said a draft CBA that proposes Sh40.3 billion in the return-to-work formula had already been concluded.He said the national and county governments were in the process of seeking the SRC's approval to ensure the pact conforms to its guidelines before it is signed.Six people died in Mombasa's largest hospital on Tuesday as the strike entered its second day.Patients lay unattended in wards and long queues formed at the emergency section."For now, we only focus on the very critical cases," a doctor at the hospital, who asked not to be named because he was not authorised to speak, told Reuters at the casualty ward."Places like the maternity wing cannot function at all without nurses. So operations there are literally grounded," he said, adding that they had advised mothers-to-be to seek private facilities.
