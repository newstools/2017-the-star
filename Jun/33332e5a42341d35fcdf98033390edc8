We will not take the offer by IEBC to do any&nbsp;inspection&nbsp;in Dubai. If NASA wants to boycott the elections let them boycott," Tuju said after a meeting with IEBC on Thursday. "We cannot have a situation where NASA makes false claims then the IEBC catches a cold and does everything to&nbsp;appease&nbsp;them, handing them&nbsp;tickets&nbsp;like sweets." Tuju said&nbsp;the electoral agency is running around instead of preparing for the August 8 general election. "NASA will always complain [about] something. Each of them calculated to derail the elections...they talk too much," he said.&nbsp; "W e are very disappointed with IEBC...that when NASA&nbsp;says something they run around like headless chicken." He said the Jubilee Party's mandate is not to&nbsp;instill&nbsp;confidence in the IEBC but to&nbsp;concentrate&nbsp;on more&nbsp;important&nbsp;issues. Tuju further defended President Uhuru Kenyatta for meeting&nbsp;Majid Saif Al Ghurair,&nbsp;chair of Al Ghurair Printing and Publishing Company. The Star exclusively reported that the&nbsp;prominent Al Ghurair family hosted Uhuru before a Sh2.5 billion tender to print IEBC ballot papers was awarded to the eponymous firm.&nbsp;The Star even attached a picture of the meeting. But Tuju claimed on Thursday: "The person who met with the President just has a similar name as that of Azizi&nbsp;Al Ghurair. He is a different person."
