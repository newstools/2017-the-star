Changing the government will derail the realisation of Vision 2030 as it may delay the implementation of development goals the Jubilee administration has already put in place, Devolution PS Irungu Nyakera has said.Kenyans should reelect Jubilee for continuity so it can complete the projects it already started, he said.&ldquo;A new government may choose to prioritise other things and totally do away with the programmes we have already initiated,&rdquo; Nyakera said.He spoke on Friday in Murang&rsquo;a county during the County Consultative Forum for the Third Medium Term Plan.The PS noted that the government has grown the economy from Sh50 billion in 2013 to Sh70 billion.He also noted that the Jubilee administration has created more than 840,000 jobs annually since 2013. &ldquo;Even though the President had promised to provide one million jobs annually, the government is doing everything possible to provide employment and is only falling short of that promise narrowly,&rdquo; Nyakera added.The government, he said, has installed more than 3,000 CCTV in Nairobi and Mombasa, which have improved security.
