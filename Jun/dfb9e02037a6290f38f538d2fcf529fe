Nairobi governor aspirant Mike Sonko has escaped losing his 11 acres he used as surety for 38 people accused of being members of the MRC group.The land is in Kwale, The accused include group leader Omar Mwamnuadzi, alias president. Sonko was expected to forfeit the land after Mwamnuadzi went missing and absconded court.However, Mombasa chief magistrate Francis Kyambia yesterday said Sonko will pay a Sh100,000 fine. Kyambia said Sonko will have to serve a civil jail term, not exceeding six months if he fails to pay the fine.The magistrate said the court could have not forfeited the whole bond as the surety stood for not only Mwamnuadzi, but also for another 37 accused persons.He further said the senator had proven to court that he had made efforts to find Mwamnuadzi, but failed.He said Sonko had appeared before the court several times when summoned to explain the whereabouts of Mwamnuadzi. Sonko had told the court he had employed a private investigator to look for Mwamnuadzi, but their efforts were unsuccessful.He said the investigator had also gone to Tanzania after getting information that he might have fled to the country.But Sonko said the MRC leader might have been killed and his body hidden.He told the court that Mwamnuadzi&rsquo;s family believes he might have been abducted and killed.CHAMPIONED SECESSIONIn 2012, the group was championing for separation of the Coast region from the rest of the country.But their efforts were thwarted by police, leading to the arrest of some of MRC members who were later charged for being members of an out lawed group.Sonko came to their rescue after they stayed in custody for a month and bailed them out. But Mwamnuadzi has been missing court proceedings.Several warrants of arrest were is-sued by the court, but police said they were unable to trace Mwamnuadzi.Hospital documents produced in court, showing that Mwamnuadzi had been sick and admitted at the Coast General Hospital, were proven to be forged and fraudulent.This was after the hospital informed the prosecution that the alleged ad-mission number belonged to someone else. In April, Sonko sought to be dis-charged from being Mwamnuadzi&rsquo;s surety. The magistrate had earlier said it was right for the state to take Sonko&rsquo;s land, which he used as surety.He said Sonko has two options - being discharged or forfeiting the land.But Mwamnuadzi&rsquo;s lawyer Yusuf Abubakar told the court not to punish Sonko as he acted in goodwill.
