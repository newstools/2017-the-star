The NASA coalition has promised to promote a united nation and end tribalism in its manifesto set to be launched today.The opposition says it will work to build a strong nation, committed to nurturing and protecting the well-being of every citizen."We are not a nation of 41 ethnic groups or 42 when we include the Makonde. Our government will treat all citizens equally and respectfully. Ethnic profiling of citizens in the issuance of national identity cards and passports will end," the manifesto reads.It adds, "Under NASA, no Kenyan will feel discriminated on basis of ethnicity, race, religion, gender, age or socio-economic status".NASA says men and women will have a right to equal treatment, including the right to equal opportunity in political, economic and social spheres.The coalition says its administration will provide a nation where leadership is inclusive.It says the State shall take legislative and other measures including affirmative action policies to redress any disadvantage suffered by individuals or groups because of past discrimination."Nasa believes that devolution is the vehicle for the political and socio-economic transformation of our nation- the vehicle that will take us to the promise land," the manifesto says.

"We will delegate the responsibility for Primary and Secondary school infrastructure to the county governments and create a framework for security collaboration between the national and county governments," it reads.The coalition has maintained once it assumes power, it will immediately abolish secondary school tuition fees and expand secondary school places with a target of achieving 100 percent enrollment within five years.For those joining form one, more than 10 per cent are not completing due to lack of fees."The culture of terminology of failures and dropouts will be a thing of the past. No child should be condemned to this stigma by an examination whose only purpose is to eliminate those who it has failed by not having enough schools" it reads.The Raila-Kalonzo administration will also expand higher education loans presently limited to universities to cover all post-secondary education institutions including TIVET, while pursuing innovative ways of financing higher education infrastructure.Read:&nbsp;Nasa reacts to Jubilee manifesto, says Uhuruto offers nothing new
