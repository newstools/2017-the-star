National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale has defended a controver- sial bill with far-reaching proposals to establish power symmetry in the bi- cameral House. He hit out at critics of the Parlia- mentary Service Bill, 2017, terming it a &ldquo;panacea&rdquo; for the frequent turf wars between the Senate and the National Assembly. The bill by the Parliamentary Ser- vice Commission also seeks to limit the tenure of the Senate and National Assembly Clerks to a maximum of two terms. Currently clerks retire at the age of 60. &ldquo;There is no way a clerk can serve for 20 years. We want a clerk to serve one renewable term and exit after serving two terms for best practice,&rdquo; Duale said. He accused Senate Clerk Jeremi- ah Nyegenye of attempting to block the enactment of the bill aimed at aligning the administrative structure of Parlia- ment with the Constitution. &ldquo;He is the only person standing in the way of this bill,&rdquo; Duale said. He dismissed claims the bill would create power imbalance in the House, adding that with National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi, PSC chairman and Senate clerk as Secretary, there is already balance. &ldquo;Nobody should be worried. This is a fantastic bill. Nothing makes the Sen- ate clerk the accounting officer of the PSC,&rdquo; Duale said. He said no powers will be clipped from the Senate clerk as alleged as both clerks already have authority to incur expenditure. MPs in 2014 amended the Public Fi- nance Management Act to give the Na- tional Assembly clerk authority to in- cur expenditure, following supremacy tussles. The bill was first published in October 2015, but was not enacted by the House, leading to its lapsing at the end of the last session of Parliament. Parliament is currently operating on the obsolete Parliamentary Service Act, 2000.
