The European Union has dispatched 30 election observers to Kenya 40 days before the General Election on August 8 (see Page 10). Election observation is vital in democratic elections the world over. The EU says on its election observation website that it &ldquo;contributes to strengthening democratic institutions, building public confidence in electoral processes, helping to deter fraud, intimidation and violence&rdquo;. There will be other observers from elsewhere.Also important, indeed essential, will be the activities of Kenyan observers, given the new mode of announcing the presidential results.The lessons of 2013 ought to have been learnt and internalized by all players in the forthcoming 12th General Election. There were places without observers and there was intimidation and harassment of some observers in some places on a violently partisan basis.Election observation this time needs to be done in such a way that President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s observers in Bondo and Raila Odinga&rsquo;s in Gatundu South can go about their business unafraid, because unhindered and unmolested.Internal observers should be dispatched to their areas early, to acclimatise.
