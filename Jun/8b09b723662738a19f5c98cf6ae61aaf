A report released by a Mombasa-based peace and security organisation says social media is the biggest threat to peace and cohesion at the Coast ahead of the August 8 General Election (see P30).This report cites 39 serious incidents that have been reported, including postings by criminal gangs.KCCS&rsquo;s research found the most negative energy on WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter-generated social media wars, some of them resulting in actual violence.It is easy for people to have a Twitter handle that is not in their names and to post the most abusive and inflammatory material in total anonymity.Kenyans need to behave more responsibly online, self-moderating their language. Electioneering has seen social media go rogue and a lot of posting remains anonymous and beyond the reach of even the police.But Kenya should not block the Internet in the manner of Turkey and Rwanda, just because the state cannot control inflammatory posts.Post to the same high standards that you demand and expect of mainstream digital media.
