These goodies are the last kicks of either a dying donkey or a horse being employed by the Jubilee government. President Uhuru Kenyatta has to craft his survival tactics, but you know it is too late and too little to change anything.Voters at this juncture have made up their minds &ndash; either President Uhuru is going home or not. Dishing out cash at this moment definitely cannot help him. Therefore, it is unfortunate that Uhuru had all this time, to be exact four-and-a-half years, and now has resorted doing what he is he doing.I am certain that this is the perception they want to create, that the money they gave in such regions will translate into extra votes while, in the real sense, they are prepared to steal from that region.We know the game plan they want to play, claiming the last-minute money they gave to Kisii or Bungoma gave some them extra votes, whereas it is a strategy for them to steal from those regions.It is not proper to issue last-minute goodies towards elections, but he will say he is still the President in office and nothing stops him from carrying out government&rsquo;s everyday mandate and responsibility, but you know it is immoral.Being in the office is the only advantage that he could have of dishing out money, but I am certain the people have made up their minds on who to vote for at the August election.Even if you look at these goodies and promises being dished out, they are not genuine. Internally Displaced People from the Kisii community, for example, have waited for long, they should have given the Kisii the same share they have given Kikuyus or to other regions.If people would have gotten even Sh300,000 or Sh400,00 per IDP, it would have made a lot of sense, instead of the Sh50,000. But, at this juncture, I don't think there is much to be had out of that, people will take the money without necessarily voting for them.I am being told that there is not even a proper channel to give out the money. This is an exercise in futility. It will achieve nothing. It is time for President Uhuru and his Deputy William Ruto to start collecting their private items and removing them from government premises and let in the NASA government.Arati is the Dagoretti MP (ODM)
