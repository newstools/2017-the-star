Residents of Karatina and Mathira in Nyeri have rejected President Uhuru Kenyatta's voting plan to secure the most votes for Jubilee Party.Uhuru addressed a mammoth crowd in Karatina town where he urged voters to elect the party's senator, governor, women representative, MP and MCA candidates. He said this will foster unity.This was also the President's message in Mathira, which he visited earlier on Thursday, as part of his tour of the county.The people waved signs reading 'no' and also showed their position using hand signs.Jubilee's Mathira MP nominee Rigathi Gachagua, who attended the rally there, is facing stiff opposition from independent candidates Wambura Wamaranga and incumbent Peter Weru.Acknowledging the people's position, Uhuru said: "It seems there is a something else here but we shall work with whoever you give the vote."Nyeri, which is Uhuru's home turf, is known for electing individuals instead of parties and it seems this year's poll will be no different.Residents interviewed before Uhuru arrived said they did not want him to campaign for their leaders."President amekaribishwa but tunaomba aongee tu juu ya campaign yake, si grassroots campaigns (He is welcome but let him focus on his campaigns, not grassroots affairs)," one said."Asiongee juu ya ma MPs, senators... hao ni sisi tutawachagua (Let him not talk about MPs, senators and the others. We will make our own decisions)."Another raised the issue of IDPs, saying the President should not forget them."Kindly address their plight," he said.Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto also camped in Mt Kenya. The message by the two was welcomed in Chaka and Mweiga in Kieni constituency. They urged the people to turn up in large numbers and vote for Jubilee's re-election.Uhuru said NASA flag bearer Raila Odinga is aiming for a coalition government, but noted this can be prevented with a voter turnout of 100 per cent.He further accused Raila of preaching politics of hatred instead of uniting Kenyans.More on this: Raila creating IEBC tender row to push for 'nusu mkate' government - UhuruThe President outlined his administration's achievements including the SGR, free maternity services and the supply of electricity and water.He also took note of the government's promise for free secondary education from January 2018.On all his tours so far, he has highlighted development projects by his administration and criticised NASA leaders for not accomplishing much while in government.Read: Uhuru takes Jubilee vote hunting to Nyeri home turf
