Jubilee Nairobi aspirants have given independent candidates up to Monday to step down or face a political war ahead of August 8 polls. In a strategy meeting held at Stedmak restaurant on Thursday, the politicians said independents are "spoilers and enemies out to deny the party a convincing victory". Governor hopeful Mike Sonko (Nairobi Senator) said they will engage all independents in the coming week to convince them to withdraw from the race. Sonko said the move will ensure JP wins most seats. "We will compensate those who will agree to step down. We will even accommodate them in our government because we are sure we are going to win," he said. "Those who will not toe the line will be our enemies. We will declare total war against them. We shall camp in their areas and tell the people why they should not be elected." Sonko further said incumbent Governor Evans Kidero has failed Nairobians and there is no way he will win. "Jubilee Party is headed for a clean sweep in the city and will not allow spoilers to stand on its way." The legislator further asked Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua to restrict his Maendeleo Chap Chap party activities to the county. "We don't want him to interfere with us in Nairobi," he said, adding that a survey by the Interior ministry showed JP will win 44 MCA seats against ODM's 35. Wiper, Sonko said, would grab two seats with independents also likely to win the same number. The Senator appealed to former Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth, an independent, to drop his bid saying they were willing to accommodate him in government. "I want to say sorry to PK because he may be bitter with me because of the comments I made on Citizen TV," he said. "But he also got it wrong by saying I am a hooligan. I want to tell him to calm down. We will even plead with the president to give him an executive job." Woman representative Rachel Shebesh said all independents and those running for various seats under other parties are enemies of Jubilee. "If you are an independent, then you are an enemy. There are no two ways about it...we will fight you," she said. Shebesh, who is seeking to retain her seat, exuded confidence that JP will scoop all the seats in the general elections. Sonko's running mate Polycarp Igathe highlighted the duo's agenda for city residents. He accused the incumbent of failing Nairobians, saying their administration will address the traffic menace, create jobs for the youth and improve water, sanitation and health services.
