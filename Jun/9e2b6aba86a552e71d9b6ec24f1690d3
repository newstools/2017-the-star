Pierra Makena has criticised body shaming of mothers, especially after giving birth. She had earlier on been trashed for her her body and hair, with some calling her weave/wig a "burning bush". She clearly did not take that lightly, as she took to social media to say: "The last thing a person should tell a Mother is how bad she looks. Putting her down is unfair and uncouth. This should stop.. I speak as a mom! And kudos to all women and mothers looking gorgeous and bringing up beautiful children!"She received a lot of praise for her bravery to talk about the matter. Here are some of the reactions from her post:jey_jesh: Respect to all mothers.
