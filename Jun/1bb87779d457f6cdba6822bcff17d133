Meru Governor Peter Munya skipped President Uhuru Kenyatta’s tour of the county on Friday and Saturday. It is not clear why he did not attend the functions. Uhuru was accompanied by Deputy President William Ruto. Others who attended the events are Senator Kiraitu Murungi, MPs Mithika Linturi (Igembe South), Mpuru Aburi (Tigania East) and Florence Kajuju (woman representative). Linturi, who is seeking the Senate seat, on Thursday told Munya to keep off the event because “he has been supporting the opposition”. “We know Munya has been hiring goons... he should not bring his chaotic politics to the presidential function,” he said. Kiraitu also accused Munya of giving hired goons Jubilee T-shirts to disrupt Uhuru’s campaigns. But Munya denied the allegations and welcomed Uhuru to the region. “Maybe it is Kiraitu doing that. Two weeks ago, he hired youths to cut down trees and block me from accessing Nkubu town,” he said. Kiraitu will battle for the governor seat against Munya of PNU. On Friday, the Jubilee convoy pitched camp in Igoji shopping centre at 11am then carried out roadside rallies in Kanyakine, Ntharene and Kariene in South Imenti. The group later proceeded to Buuri and North Imenti constituencies. On Saturday, Uhuru addressed rallies in Igembe and Tigania constituencies. In his address, he asked residents to reelect him and vote for Jubilee candidates. In South and North Imenti constituencies, Uhuru’s endorsement of Kiraitu was well-received. There was hostility as Uhuru tried to endorse Kiraitu in Igembe and Tigania. “I know some of you will vote for other candidates here. I will not impose candidates on people as this might spoil my votes. I still need the votes of those who will not vote for Jubilee candidates,” he said. Early this month, Kiraitu accused Munya of hiring goons to destroy his campaign posters. He reported the matter at Meru police station. “It is an election offence for any candidate or agents of that candidates to deface or remove the election materials of their opponents or other candidates or political party,” Kiraitu said.
