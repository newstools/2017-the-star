Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has said he left Wiper as there was no development agenda and members were keener on fights than the people's needs.The Maendeleo Chap Chap leader further said he was attacked and ridiculed by Wiper politicians for his move to "change how politics is done by putting mwananchi first"."It's no surprise that Wiper is fighting me...the leaders there are scared of me for changing the lives of the people of Ukambani," he said on the JKL show on Wednesday."I left Wiper party because we would attend meetings and the people would discuss how to make leaders fall, who is the best...to the detriment of Kenyans."The party's leader is Kalonzo Musyoka who is National Super Alliance Deputy President candidate.Read: Wiper results fake, Mutua tells KalonzoThe county boss dismissed leaders for derailing his 2013 pledge to turn Machakos into a Dubai."Investors were ready to help me realise my dream but Wiper leaders moved to court and four years later, the investors pulled out and started investing in other countries. The good thing is that the case was thrown out of court," he said.The Governor said he will seek re-election based on his key projects and the desire to help Machakos residents change their lives."On August 8, I will beat my opponents [by a big margin] because I am up to the task. For instance, I built a 33km road in three months, and for the first time since independence, Machakos was not in the list of areas to receive relief food."Mutua, a former government spokesperson, asked his opponents to campaign peacefully and sell their agenda without tarnishing the reputation of other leaders."My opponents have said that they will stop all my projects if they come into power because they see their value, but that cannot stop me," he said.Mutua will face Wiper candidate Wavinya Ndeti who is considered his biggest rival, and whom Kalonzo said has the potential to become the county's first female governor.More on this: Governor Mutua launches Maendeleo Chap Chap party ahead of 2017 bidAlso read: Kalonzo is the known Ukambani kingpin, not Mutua, leaders say
