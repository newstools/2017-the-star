Tongaren MP Eseli Simiyu will defend his seat against five others onAugust 8. All six have received approval to run for election. The others include Amos Ongaro and Bernard Simiyu, both independents, John Chikati of Jubilee, Lawrence Bifwoli of ODM and ANC's Nickson Sifuna.Eseli was cleared by the IEBC on Thursday morning.He urged residents to relect him to continue with his development agenda.The Ford Kenya secretary general said he will prioritise education once reelected.Eseli promised to ensure a medical training college, a teachers' training college and a university campus are set up in Tongaren constituency.He urged Kenyans to join hands and send the Jubilee regime home, saying it has made life unbearable for Kenyans."Jubilee were celebrating thinking that NASA will not be united and will separate with the headache of naming its flagbearer, but they are now in panic mode after realising that we are united with one cause of sending them home for failing Kenyans," Eseli said.Eseli criticised the government for inflating the cost of building the standard gauge railway, which was officially launched in Mombasa on Wednesday by President Uhuru Kenyatta. "Ethiopia built an electric railway line at an affordable price, but here it is using locomotive and is still very expensive, yet they call themselves digital," he said.
