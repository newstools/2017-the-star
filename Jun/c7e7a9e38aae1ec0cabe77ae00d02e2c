Working night shifts thwarts the body's self-repair system - raising the risk of life-threatening diseases, according to new research.A study found staff doing unsociable hours get rid of five times less disease-causing chemicals in their urine.This means damage to DNA accumulates because of the natural mending process - fuelled by the 'sleep hormone' melatonin - malfunctions.Melatonin is produced by the brain when we are asleep but amounts drop in the presence of light compared to the dark.More than three million Britons work nights and scientists say they could need to take supplements of the vital hormone to protect their health.Previous studies have shown working nights increases the risk of heart disease, cancer, diabetes and neurological disorders.Shift work has been classified as a probable carcinogen by the World Health Organisation for a decade.Epidemiologist Dr Parveen Bhatti said melatonin regulates the internal body clock or circadian rhythm.Levels of 8-OH-dG in participants' urine the day preceding a night shift were only 20 percent of those observed during a normal night's sleep of 7.5 hours.This is the most common and mutagenic DNA lesion induced by disease-causing chemicals called reactive oxygen species.
