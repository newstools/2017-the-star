Tongaren MP Eseli Simiyu will defend his seat against five others onAugust 8. All six have received approval to run for election. The others include Amos Ongaro and Bernard
Simiyu, both independents, John Chikati of Jubilee, Lawrence Bifwoli of ODM and ANC's Nickson Sifuna. Eseli was cleared by the IEBC on Thursday morning. He urged residents to relect him to continue with his development agenda. The Ford
Kenya secretary general said he will prioritise education once reelected. Eseli promised
to ensure a medical training college, a teachers' training college and a university
campus are set up in Tongaren constituency. He urged
Kenyans to join hands and send the Jubilee regime home, saying it has
made life unbearable for Kenyans. "Jubilee
were celebrating thinking that NASA will not be united and will separate with
the headache of naming its flagbearer, but they are now in panic mode after
realising that we are united with one cause of sending them home for failing Kenyans," Eseli said.  Eseli criticised the government for inflating the cost of building
the standard gauge railway, which was
officially launched in Mombasa on Wednesday by President Uhuru Kenyatta.
"Ethiopia built an electric railway line at an affordable
price, but here it is using locomotive
and is still very expensive, yet they call themselves digital," he said.
