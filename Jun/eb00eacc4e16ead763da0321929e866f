Two Laikipia governor hopefuls and an MP on Friday were cleared by the electoral commission. Governor Joshua Irungu (Jubilee) and Nderitu Muriithi (independent) were cleared by county returning officer Agnes Mutisya. Nominated MP Sarah Lekorere was cleared by Moses Njeru at Naibor Secondary School to run for Laikipia North MP on the JP ticket. She is seeking to unseat Mathew Lempurkel of ODM in a race that has attracted three other contenders &mdash; James Lowasa (PNU), Maina Munene and Richard Leiyagu (independent). Mutisya confirmed that Thuita Mwangi, who had withdrawn from the governor race to back Muriithi, presented his papers on Thursday. &ldquo;He did not return the documents in person but were they presented by a lady identified as Sylvia Museiya,&rdquo; she said. Muriithi said the journey to deliver the county has started and justice will prevail.
