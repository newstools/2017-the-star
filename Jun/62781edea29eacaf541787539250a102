This is the 21st century, you can't hide."The photographer cum model went on to explain that he did not con her by taking her money."She broke things in my house [during the confrontation and] the money she sent was for paying for them. She was paying for my stuff that she broke in my house, did she explain that? She broke my laptop, flash drive, iphone, expensive glass table and many other things. She has her own M-Pesa pin, she should show you messages of me borrowing the money. I cannot be as stupid as using my number to con someone. Since I was traveling, I allowed her to send the money to my number."
