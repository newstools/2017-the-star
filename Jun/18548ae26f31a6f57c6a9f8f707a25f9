Early one morning as we approached the quarry dam between No7 and No8, two black-backed jackals were seen lying down in the road. They quickly stood up and trotted away, then looked back on us and relaxed when they thought we were not a threat. After watching them for a few minutes, we left them lying under some shrubs.We continued to enjoy other sightings as we drove on past No10 and headed towards the Athi basin. Then suddenly, there was a rapid movement in the long grass near the road&hellip; Wow! it was two black-backed jackals fighting over a freshly killed yellow-necked spurfowl. They pulled and manoeuvered for a few minutes before one of them wrested the bird carcass free and ran away to devour it.Then we proceeded down to the Athi basin. We were pleasantly surprised to find a pack of no less than seven black-backed jackals enjoying the warmth of the morning sun. We watched them for a while, until they got up and walked off into some shade as it was getting a bit hotter.Black-backed jackals are rarely seen in the park, so having three different sightings of 11 of them in total proves that they are in fact recovering as a species in the park. They are opportunistic in nature and will eat carrion or even hunt small insects, birds and mammals. I once witnessed a jackal try to catch a wildebeest calf that had been separated from its mother, but thankfully the calf escaped.There is always something interesting or fascinating to see when looking at the wonderful creations of God, so why not spend some restful time in the Nairobi Park?
