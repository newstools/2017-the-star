Health services in all public health hospitals in the Kilifi county have been disrupted after nurses downed their tools on Monday. The nurses are pushing for the implementation of a collective bargaining agreement they signed with the government in January. Kenya National Union of Nurses Kilifi county secretary general Evans Ogato vowed no nurse will resume work until their demands are met. Speaking to the Star yesterday, Ogato blamed the Public Service Board for dragging its feet in effecting the CBA.&ldquo;We have been forced to take this industrial action because the government is not keen on addressing our plight. In January, we held a meeting with the governor and were promised our issues would be ironed out in three weeks. But to date no action has been taken. Kilifi county chief officer for health Timothy Malingi said he will meet union officials today to unlock the stalemate.
