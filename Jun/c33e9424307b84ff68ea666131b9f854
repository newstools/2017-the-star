Kwale woman representative Zainab Chidzuga has hit the ground running, drumming up support for her reelection. She was cleared by the IEBC to defend her seat on the Jubilee ticket. She was elected on the ODM ticket in 2013, but ditched the party in 2014. Speaking at Mialalani in Msambweni constituency last Saturday, Chidzuga asked residents to give her a second term to complete projects and start others. She said NASA has nothing to offer the people of Kwale. Chidzuga made the remarks when launching seven silage chopping machines funded by the Kwale National Government Affirmative Action Fund that will be distributed to all subcounties. She was accompanied by Msambweni MP Jubilee candidate Bashir Kilalo. The distributed machines, each worth Sh3 million, will be used by self-help groups to produce meals for local chickens and dairy cows, as well as doormats. Chidzuga also drummed up support for Jubilee presidential candidate President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto.
