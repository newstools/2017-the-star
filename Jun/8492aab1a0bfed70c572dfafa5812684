Cases of fathers turning against their own daughters have been on the rise in the recent past in Taita Taveta county.Human rights groups, police, educational departments, the judiciary and the government have been trying to get to the bottom line of these cases, but they have hit a wall.Meanwhile, victims of these heinous crime live with trauma and pains of the actions of people who were supposed to protect them.ROBBED OF INNOCENCEClemence, a 16-year-old girl from Kishushe area, Wundanyi subcounty, is incensed with her father for defiling her.&ldquo;If I had the slightest opportunity, I would slash my father into pieces without blinking. He destroyed my life plus that of my siblings,&rdquo; she said amid tears.Clemence lost her mother in 2007 after a short illness and her tender age, she had to become a mother to her younger siblings.She said life was tough on her and most of the time she would miss school as she had to go out to look for food.Her drunkard father never cared about their welfare and she automatically became the family&rsquo;s bread winner.&ldquo;My father would go out, do some manual work but instead of buying food, he would drink alcohol to a point of becoming a nuisance and creating disturbance in the neighbourhood,&rdquo; she said.Her life took a U-turn when her father started viewing her as a &ldquo;grown-up woman&rdquo; instead of his daughter.In 2013, while sleeping in her room, her father came to her and defiled her, stealing her innocence.He warned her against reporting the matter to anyone or risk being chased away from their home.She suffered in silence but never dared talk to anyone about the suffering she went through at home.Life continued until a year later, when her father struck again.In 2014, he defiled her again and again threatened to kill her if she ever informed anyone of what goes on at home.However, it was too much for her and she decided to talk to her school headmistress, whose reaction made her regret opening up.Clemence said the headmistress told her that there is nothing she could do because they feared her father.&ldquo;It broke my heart that the person whom I thought was going to protect and assist me turned me down. I felt like dying but I remembered I had siblings to take care of,&rdquo; she said.POLICE &lsquo;BRIBED&rsquo;In a further bid to unshackle herself from being a sex slave to her own father, she went to the police station andfiled a complaint.Instead of arresting her father, the officer in charge called him and informed him of the charges her daughter had lodged against him.&ldquo;I think they later met and my father bribed him against investigating the matter because he was never arrested,&rdquo; she said.However, the father pounced on her that evening, beating her up to a point of temporarily losing her mind for three days.Clemence said that with rumours going round the village of her ordeals, she had to stay away from school for some time.&ldquo;My schoolmates used to laugh at me, joking that I was no longer a virgin and that I should be ashamed of myself, having slept with my father. I wish they knew what I was going through,&rdquo; she said.She tolerated all her father&rsquo;s torture as long as her siblings had a place to call home and sleep soundly at night.However, on January 2015, Clemence said she could no longer stand the humiliation by her father.She says the father had arrived home with plans to defile her once again but says she was a grown-up and knew that it was time she bring an end her suffering.After declining her fathers advances, he wanted to slash her with a panga but she was able to escape unhurt, although she had to spend the night at a dried river.The father this time accused her of having sex with her cousin.A police officer finally intervened and arrested her father. He is currently serving life imprisonment after successful prosecution.MOTHER&rsquo;S PAINIn Voi, Jackline Machocho is yet to come to terms with how her husband of nine years could turn against a girl who has grown up calling him father.Machocho said her 14-year-old daughter was sleeping in her bedroom with her siblings when her father sneaked into their room.He warned her against screaming for help and blocked her mouth using his hands. However, the mother heard some commotion from the girl&rsquo;s bedroom.Upon checking in her daughter&rsquo;s room, she caught her husband in the act.&ldquo;How could a man sleep with a mother and then later his daughter?&rdquo; she asks.Her screams attracted neighbours, who came and arrested her husband, before taking him to the chief&rsquo;s camp police station.However, Machocho blames herself for her daughter&rsquo;s misery, as she had been warned of her husband&rsquo;s previous records but ignored them.The husband is said to have previously defiled his blood sister and nephew, and Machocho&rsquo;s daughter was his third victim.Machocho say she was banished from her husband&rsquo;s family after declining to accept money they offered to drop the case.&ldquo;His family offered to do anything for me as long as I dropped the allegations against their son. But I could not sleep knowing I sold justice for my daughter for some few coins,&rdquo; Machocho said.She said her husband&rsquo;s family distanced itself and she has been forced to endure insults as long as her three daughters are safe.&ldquo;I am okay with doing manual work to put food on the table. But I cannot endure when someone harms my children,&rdquo; she said.The daughter, a class eight student and student leader at her school, said even though her father was sentenced to life imprisonment, she will never forgive him.&ldquo;When I stood at the witness dock testifying against him, I wished I had a panga. I would just walked up to him and show him my anger. I hate him,&rdquo; she said.FLEEING FOR SAFETYAt the Moi District Hospital in Voi, a 13-year-old girl is having difficulties in delivering her child.The newly born baby will be the only evidence the police have against her perpetrator, her biological father.The father is said to have continuously defiled her daughter and later impregnated her.A post-defilement evaluation test could not prove that the father had been defiling her, although her hymen was broken.Upon interrogation, she revealed that her father was responsible for her pregnancy, and therefore they will have to conduct a DNA test on the baby.The girl revealed that her father is already sexually assaulting her younger sister but she cannot report it to the officer.In Bughuta area, four girls have not seen their mother for two years now after they were chased away from their home.This is after declining sexual advances from their father, who has vowed to &ldquo;eat the fruit before any man does&rdquo;.The eldest sister, Martha, said she and her mother have been forced to sneak the other sisters out of the home so they can escape their father&rsquo;s wrath.Martha revealed that she was defiled at the age of 13. When her mother tried to intervene, she was beaten nearly to death.Her mother now only assists in making sure all the remaining girls run away from their home before the father pounces on them.Political leaders, including Governor John Mruttu and women&rsquo;s groups, have denounced the crime, which seems to be spreading at an alarming rate.REPEAT PERPETRATORSMaendeleo ya Wanawake Taita Taveta chapter has been at the forefront in fighting for the victims, while some of them turn their homes into rescue centres.Macrina Mwamburi, chairwoman of Maendeleo ya Wanawake, Mwangea branch, blamed drug addiction, culture and ignorance for the high rate of incest.She said illicit brews, bhang and other drugs have blinded men, making them forget their fatherly values.Voi subcounty leads with at least seven cases reported this year, while Taveta and Mwatate follow closely with four cases each.Wundanyi has fewer cases, but they might be higher, as most of them are solved by family members.Mwamburi said most culprits are repeated perpetrators, having committed similar offences more than twice, but no action was taken against them.&ldquo;The cases are mostly resolved by the elders to prevent the neighbours from knowing. The mothers are offered some money to silence them,&rdquo; she said.She said in some cases, mothers protect their husbands and fail to report defilement cases, resorting to solve them with clan elders.Lack of a gender-based violence department at the Moi Hospital, the biggest county hospital, has also contributed to the delay of running post-rape evaluation tests, hence delaying delivery of justice to the victims.
