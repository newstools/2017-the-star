Hawkers could soon stop selling their wares in the Nairobi city centre if a plan by the county government to relocate them is successful. The administration says it is renovating, expanding and building new markets outside the CBD to accommodate the traders.County secretary Robert Ayisi yesterday said the proposed market sites have been identified and construction works has started in some areas. Dandora, Ruai, Kasarani, Lucky Summer, Riruta, Makadara, Jogoo Road and Dagoretti estates are some of the areas where markets are being built. &ldquo;We are still looking for more open spaces in the estates. We are advising hawkers that business can be done anywhere in Nairobi,&rdquo; Ayisi said during a press briefing at City Hall. The county has been blamed for allowing hawkers into the CBD.
