The late veteran politician John Keen&lsquo;s daughter is locked in a dispute with a trader seeking Sh10 million from her for malicious damage to property.Pamela Soila and her workers allegedly took equipment from Christopher Mbindyo's office which deals with secretarial services.They are said to have taken aluminum display units, computers, printers, reception desk, a 14 inch TV set,and other communication gadgets.Mbindyo says he has CCTV recordings which show Soila and her workers carting the equipment away from the premises.The dispute arose from an agreement entered in 2007 in which the defendant was to hand over a shop - Studio Plaza at city center - to the businessman.Under the contract, the trader was to pay Sh 80,000 per month.The contract was to run for five years but Mbidyo claims Soila evicted him from the business premises in 2009 without reasonable cause.Through lawyer William Kipkorir, the complainant claims Keen's daughter was aware that his lease had not expired.He accused her of kicking him out without prior notice."Without regard to the written agreement, the defendants threw me out and as a result disrupted my business which was up and running."The lawyer wants the court to disregard Soila&rsquo;s defence claiming it consists of mere denials and is only aimed at prejudicing, embarrassing or delaying his case.But Soila wants the suit dismissed as it is time barred.She says it was filed six years after the alleged incident and that she is a transfer to the claims made against her.Mbindyo dismissed her saying: "Her defence is neither valid nor arguable. She was aware of the confiscation of the property as captured in the CCTV footage." "At the time my business was disrupted, it was up and running and I had accumulated sufficient goodwill and a customer base I had built over 10 years," he adds.Parties appeared before Justice Beatrice Thuranira on Tuesday and agreed to argue the matter on July 26.
