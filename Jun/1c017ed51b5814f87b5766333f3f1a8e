Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya has accused police of undermining devolution.He said they are illegally closing down busaa businesses without consulting his government, on the pretext of insecurity. &ldquo; It is us as the county government who issue licences to the clubs to operate,&rdquo; the governor said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know when they [police] realised that there was insecurity in Busaa clubs.&rdquo; Oparanya directed a women&rsquo;s group, whose business was closed in Khayega market, to reopen it. Speaking while commissioning the Khayega modern market on Tuesday, he said he will move to court to challenge police. Oparanya said if NASA forms the next government, it will increase allocation to counties to 45 per cent.
