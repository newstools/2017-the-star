Jack Ma, the founder and chief executive of the world’s largest retailer Alibaba Group, will make a stop-over in Nairobi on July 19 to meet young entrepreneurs, according to a dispatch from United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. The multi-billionaire techpreneur of the internet-driven group, who is also UNCTAD special adviser on youth entrepreneurship and small business, will be on his way to a two-day YouthConnekt Africa Summit in Kigali, Rwanda – his first visit to Africa. Ma (pictured) will meet young entrepreneurs, share ideas, experiences and explore opportunities to participate in global trade, the UNCTAD statement said. The meeting will also help raise awareness about sustainable development agenda of the Vision 2030, Kenya’s long-term development blueprint. UNCTAD secretary-general Mukhisa Kituyi described Ma – the richest man in Asia and 14th worldwide – as an influential and respected pioneer of the Internet era, innovator, entrepreneur and philanthropist. “He brings to the continent a visionary approach to entrepreneurship, a thirst for learning, and a belief in a better world for young people,” Kituyi said in the statement. “Together we will reach out to communities that feel left behind in today’s global landscape with a message of hope and self-empowerment.” Ma said in the statement he is passionate about creating a “generation of empowered youth and support long-term sustainable development”. “I have spent my career working with entrepreneurs and know the positive social and economic impact when people are given the opportunity to participate in the global economy,” he said. “It is an honour for me to be in Africa, finally.”
