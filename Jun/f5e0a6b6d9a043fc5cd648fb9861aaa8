Mombasa and the Coast should get the bigger Cabinet positions due to their support for NASA, Wiper secretary general Hassan Omar (pictured) has said. He said the region has traditionally been an opposition stronghold and it is time give it the big reward it deserves. Omar said on Wednesday Mombasa and the Coast deserve powerful dockets like Defence, Foreign Affairs, Finance and Interior, should NASA win in August. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think in Mombasa we only like partying and dancing. That era is long gone. In Mombasa, we only get Culture, Heritage, National Guidance and Tourism dockets. If you give us these dockets, we will ask our brothers to reject them,&rdquo; Omar said on Wednesday. The Coast region has 1.8 million votes. Wiper has been assured the Roads and Transport and the Foreign Affairs dockets in a power-sharing deal should NASA defeat Jubilee. He said with the policies the Wiper team has, Mombasa will be transformed into a blue economy, taking advantage of the Indian Ocean to create wealth.
