Supporters of President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s former personal assistant Njuguna Burugu have asked the IEBC to punish politicians spreading propaganda and insulting rivals.Burugu is running for Lari MP as an independent after losing the JP primaries in April to businessman Jonah Mburu.Burugu&rsquo;s supporters allege that some politicians are spreading false information against him as they are jealous of his support base.Supporter James Mwaura said it was wrong for a politician to spread propaganda.&ldquo;We saw a politician picking up a microphone and speaking ill of Burugu on Tuesday. We were shocked. We know Burugu better as a smart individual who is approachable and a good listener,&rdquo; he said.Mwaura, who declined to reveal the politician&rsquo;s name, urged the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to punish politicians who insult rivals.Speaking in Kimende town on Wednesday, Burugu urged politicians to conduct peaceful campaigns and avoid insults as that would incite rival supporters to cause chaos.&ldquo;We want our politicians to mature. We must conduct responsible campaigns that will not incite our supporters. They will fight, injure each other or even cause death and leave property destroyed,&rdquo; he said.
