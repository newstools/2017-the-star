As time draws nearer towards the ban on plastic bags, manufacturers who have one month to go are yet to start declaring their stock as directed by the government.Yesterday, Nema communications director Evans Nyabuto warned that the gazette notice issued by the Environment ministry will take effect once the deadline expires. Environment CS Judi Wakhungu notified the public that six months from February 27 [in September], the use, manufacture and importation of all plastic bags used for commercial and household packaging will be banned.Manufacturers who have until August 28 to declare their stock are also required to stop providing plastic, single-use carrier bags to customers on the same date.However most are reported to have ganged up and are now hitting at the government, saying they have made huge investments.Some manufacturers also allege there was no public participation.Nyabuto told the Star on the phone manufacturers had been &ldquo;given six months to see what to do with their huge investments&rdquo;.&ldquo;It is true they have made huge investments and that is why they were given time,&rdquo; he said. Nyabuto said the quantity of the stock set to be declared by manufacturers depends on the number of clients they have and the need for plastics.Nema complaints committee secretary John Chumo said plastics declared after August 28 will be deemed waste.Chumo said the ban on plastics has been discussed for more than 10 years and as such &ldquo;the writing is now on the wall.&rdquo;&ldquo;The interest of the nation is more important than those of an investor. We continue to receive a lot of complaints from the public on plastic and that is why we fully support the ban,&rdquo; he said.He dismissed KAM&rsquo;s assertions that the ban had not been subjected to public participation.
