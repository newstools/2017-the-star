The Agricultural Development Corporation has spelt out strategies to combat climate change, which has made it hard to manage farms under seed maize.Managing director Richard Aiyabei said the corporation is considering putting more than 5,000 acres in Trans Nzoia under irrigation to avert the effects of climate change. He was addressing workers from Namandala Farm om Monday.&ldquo;We are also looking at different agro-ecological zones to relocate crops that require a lot of water to places that have enough rainfall, and those that require little rainfall are planted in areas that are becoming marginal,&rdquo; he said.Other measures the corporation will take include diversifying into a variety of crops other than maize and investing in machinery to encourage planting without much cultivation to preserve enough moisture for the growth of crops. Aiyabei said climate change is being felt and has plunged the corporation into debt, finding it hard to even pay its workers. He gave an example of how windstorms and hailstorms in 2014 destroyed maize crops worth Sh381 million.The corporation owns eight farms in Trans Nzoia &mdash; Olngatongo, Katuke, Fidly, Namandala, Naipharm, Swam Orchard and Japata.The MD, however, said the government has released over Sh500 million for the corporation to pay its 25, 000 workers dues that had accumulated since 2000 when the company faced financial challenges.
