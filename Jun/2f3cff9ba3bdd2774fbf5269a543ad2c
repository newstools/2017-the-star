Dubai-based printing firm Al Ghurair has denied links with President Uhuru Kenyatta.The firm, which has been contracted to print ballot papers for the August 8 General Election, says it has done 50 per cent of the work, and it is a different entity from the one whose officials met the Head of State in Nairobi.The firm, in papers filed in court yesterday, says the meeting between Majid Saif Al Ghurair and Uhuru was in his capacity as the head of Dubai Chamber of Commerce.The firm was responding to a suit filed by NASA challenging the contract. The company further says the Al Ghurair Group, whose CEO is Majid Saif, deals in iron, steel and real estate, and its website has not included printing or publishing among its portfolio.&ldquo;None of its staff and directors of shareholders have ever been to State House or have ever met the President,&rdquo; reads part of the affidavit filed in court.While discrediting the contract to the Dubai printing firm, NASA had said the company directors met Uhuru and IEBC officials at State House, Nairobi, before it was awarded the Sh2.5 billion tender. &ldquo;It is however well clarified in this affidavit from the above explanations that there is no relationship whatsoever between the said Majid Saif Al Ghurair and the Al Ghurair Printing and Publishing, save for the name &lsquo;Al Ghurair&rsquo; ,&rdquo; said the firm&rsquo;s general manager Ganapathy Lakshmanan. The firm says the name Al Ghurair is fairly common in Dubai and allegations by NASA are not sufficient to sustain the claim.
