A Ugandan citizen is seeking court orders to exhume the body of businessman Ivan Ssemwanga so he can retrieve money his gang members buried alongside his body. Magugu Abey has named A Plus Funeral Management and the Bank of Uganda as respondents in suit papers filed at the country's High Court. He says the bank acted in negligence by failing “to ensure the respect of monetary currency of Uganda and other countries”. “All the currencies of Uganda shillings, South African Rand and United States Dollars and/or other currencies put in the grave and buried along with Ivan Ssemwanga’s body be removed by ordering the respondents to exhume the said late for purposes of respecting the Uganda currency and other currencies,” reads part of the application. During Ssemwanga’s funeral last Tuesday, members of his Rich Gang crew poured expensive champagne and splashed money in his grave as the casket was lowered for burial. The floor of the tiled grave was filled with denominations of Ugandan shillings, South African Rands and US dollars. The flamboyant billionaire businessman was well known for throwing wads of cash at revelers in parties he attended in Uganda and South Africa. The amazing bit about Abey’s application, however, is that he wants the court to allow him custody of the cash so he can put it back into circulation. “The applicant be allowed to recover all the said monies on behalf of the Republic of Uganda and other respective countries,” reads the suit. Ssemwanga wa married to Zari Hassan before she divorced him and married Bongo Flava heartrob Diamond Platnumz (Naseeb Abdul Juma) with whom she has a daughter, Latifah Dangote. Zari, a Ugandan socialite, had three children with Ssemwanga. Read: Zari pays tribute to Ivan amid conflict over his wealth
