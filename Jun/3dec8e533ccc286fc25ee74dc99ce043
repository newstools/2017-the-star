Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago says he’s no tribalist. He warned residents against being divided along ethnic lines by “self-centred candidates”. Last week, Nakuru independent candidates called for the arrest of Mandago and his allies for allegedly making inciteful remarks. The two allegedly said that should one tribe from the region vote for Mandago’s rival Zedekiah Bundotich, known as Buzeki, they will advise their supporters to choose NASA. Mandago on Thursday teamed up with former Chief Registrar of the Judiciary Gladys Shollei to campaign in Kesses. They urged residents to adopt the six-piece voting pattern — one party only and no independents. “We assure President Kenyatta and DP William Ruto we will vote for Jubilee candidates right from the top to the bottom. We are fully in Jubilee and those other people are not part of us,” Mandago said. Shollei said all Jubilee candidates are in agreement that they will campaign together to deliver the region to the party. “Our main focus is unity of our people and we know Jubilee means well for our region. It’s the party with the agenda to transform our region and the country for better lives,” she said.
