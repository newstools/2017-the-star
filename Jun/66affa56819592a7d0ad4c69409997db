Kenya should create more awareness on investment opportunities for environmentally-friendly projects to green financing from global investors, a forum heard yesterday in Nairobi. Participants at the Green Finance Conference said few investors understand green economy and that authorities need to create a more conducive environment for the growth of green finance and green energy in the country. &ldquo;We need a supportive ecosystem in terms of regulatory framework and capacity building on green finance within the capital markets,&rdquo; Kenya Agribusiness and Agroindustry Alliance chief executive Lucy Muchoki said yesterday. &ldquo;Most people do not know what a green economy is.&rdquo;The Kenya Bankers Association and the Nairobi Securities Exchange are planning to issue the country&rsquo;s first green bond in the third quarter of this year. Proceeds from this will finance projects in the renewable energy, energy-efficiency, green transport and wastewater treatment sectors. &ldquo;Kenya is already well ahead of other countries,&rdquo; International Trade Centre chief executive Felix Bikpo said. &ldquo;The Kenyan Green Bond by KBA and NSE will be a reliable source of finance from both domestic and external sources.&rdquo; The value of green bonds issued globally last year rose 120 per cent to $93.4 billion (aboutSh9.68 trillion).
