Agriculture CS Willy Bett on Friday officially gazetted names of a task force to coordinate the ongoing government food subsidy programme.The team, led by Agriculture PS Richard Lesiyampe, will offer guidance to the state by providing up-to-date status of maize grain, sugar, powdered milk and other essential commodities to help determine demand and supply.Members of the taskforce include former director of agriculture and crop management Johnson Irungu, former National Cereals Produce Board acting managing director Cornel Ngelechey, Heifer International country manager Augustine Cheruiyot and the director of public health Kepha Ombacho.Others are Wanyambura Mwambia of the Treasury, Arthur Osiya, Ruth Wachira, William Karari, Jasper Mbiuki, Joseph Ngetich and the Attorney General.The gazette notice dated May 2 says the taskforce has the mandate to identify possible areas in which duty can be exempted on essential commodities and their competitive imports and prepare progress reports on implementation of the product.&ldquo;The task force shall remain in office for a period of four months from May 2, 2017 or for such a longer period as the Cabinet Secretary may by notice in the Gazette prescribe,&rdquo; the gazette notice reported.The government last month offered millers a Sh6 billion subsidy aimed at reducing the retail price of maize flour to Sh90 per kilogramme from an average market cost of Sh140.Treasury CS Henry Rotich in April allowed the importation of duty free maize and sugar.On May 4, the Kenya Revenue Authority implemented the directive for duty-free importation of yellow and white maize in a window set to expire on August 31 and July 31 respectively.The Authority stated that the import duty free white maize was available for any willing candidate while duty free yellow maize was restricted to importers listed by the National Treasury in the quantity specified against each importer in the list.He also removed duty on powdered milk allowing importation of 9,000 tonnes of the product.In November 2009, the government rolled out a Sh600 million meal voucher project that sought to feed 100,000 poor people in Nairobi, Kisumu and Mombasa. Through the subsidy programme 200,000 vulnerable families were to get Sh1,500 monthly cash handouts in Kenya&rsquo;s first ever cash-based social safety net programme.
