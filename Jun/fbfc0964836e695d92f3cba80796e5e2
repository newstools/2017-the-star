The water hyacinth that has choked Lake Naivasha has been termed the biggest challenge facing the water body.Stakeholders have urged the government to engage the youth to manually remove the weed from the lake before it spreads further.Nearly a third of the lake is covered by the hyacinth. Peter Muthui from the Friends of Lake Naivasha group said the much-touted beetle that was supposed to eliminate the weed has failed. &ldquo;The scientific method involved introducing the beetle into the lake, but this did not work, leading to the current crisis,&rdquo; Muthui said. He said the weed has hurt fishing and tourism, since boat operators are unable to navigate their vessels. Lake Naivasha Boat Owners&rsquo; Association chairman David Kilo said fishermen lose nets worth thousands of shillings every week as they are damaged by the weed. He accused the government of concentrating on Lake Victoria and forgetting Lake Naivasha.Centre for Environmental Action executive director Karanja Njoroge said the weed could be used to make baskets and other household items.
