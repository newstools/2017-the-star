The Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa is seeking harmonisation of seed policies and regulations in the bloc to attract more private sector investments. Participants at the launch of Comesa-aligned national seed laws held in Nairobi yesterday said the varied regulatory regimes on seed production and certification have made it costly for investors. &ldquo;By working to ensure that national level seed laws are aligned with regional policies, private sector firms will be willing to increase investments in commercial seeds for export, making better seeds and inputs readily available to farmers across Africa,&rdquo; Food Trade East and Southern Africa team leader Steve Orr said. Orr said that the programme is also focused on improving the quality and quantity of staple foods produced in the region ensuring that farmers benefit from trading surpluses across the region. The synchronisation of seed laws and regulations is aimed at establishing consistent domestication, application, monitoring and improvement in seed certification, quarantine and agricultural crop disease measures. John Mukuka, Comesa seed expert, said that the prevalence to fake seeds in the 19-member bloc averages about 10 to 25 per cent depending on the country.&ldquo;But by building the capacity of the countries and gazetting the harmonised regulations, it now gives the countries the mandate to be able to produce quality seeds and also combat fake seeds in the process,&rdquo;Mukuka said.He added that the implementation of the regulations will help boost the seed trade in Comesa to Sh500 billion ($5 billion) in the next five years.Under the Comesa Seed Harmonisation Implementation Programme, the laws will enhance evaluation and release of seed varieties among Comesa countries giving small-scale farmers better access to quality inputs and related technology. &ldquo;I am happy to note that all the country processes have been home-grown and sensitive to country situations while keeping the broader objective of attaining the harmonized regulations in focus,&rdquo; Agriculture PS Richard Lesiyampe said at the forum. &ldquo;This deliberate inclusivity in the process has led to harmonised regulations that are widely acceptable to seed industry stakeholders.&rdquo; The Alliance for Commodity Trade in Eastern and Southern Africa has facilitated the completion and gazettement of synchronised seed trade policies and regulations in Kenya, Zimbabe, Uganda, Burundi and Rwanda.
