Presidential flag bearer Raila Odinga has said NASA will field one candidate for the Bungoma governor race in the August 8 polls. The coalition will decide who between ODM's Alfred Khangati, ANC's Stephen Muturo and Ford Kenya's Wycliffe Wangamati will unseat incumbent Governor Kenneth Lusaka. Lusaka is the region's point man for Jubilee party and has been making inroads in Western for the ruling coalition. But NASA wants to ensure they retain votes in the populous Western region. It is keen on presenting a united front to secure majority representation. "We have very strong candidates in Bungoma and we do not want to make a mistake that will make Lusaka capitalise and sail through," Raila said during a rally in Posta Grounds on Friday.

Nyongesa was told he would be considered for another position in the government after NASA sweeps the August 8 polls. Raila also asked ANC's David Makali to reconsider his bid, assuring that he will occupy Wetang'ula's seat once NASA forms the government. But Kakamega Senator Bonny Khalwale asked residents to vote for Ford Kenya candidates so that Western can establish a strong economic block. He said seats in Western should be left to Ford Kenya and ANC, while presidential votes go to Raila. These sentiments did not go down well with supporters of Khangati and Raila was forced to intervene. Analysts say if NASA does not come up with one candidate for the region then Lusaka will win in the general elections. "We're having dangerous remarks from ODM's Khangati, who says if residents don't vote for him then let them vote for someone else as Wangamati is still a toddler in politics," Isaac Wanjekeche said. Wanjekeche told the Star that Khangati has been on record telling Wangamati to first vie for MCA or MP before going for governor as it is a big post that needs someone with leadership and political experience. He said NASA is facing problems of candidature because it failed to have a consolidated nomination process like Jubilee. He also noted that Khangati enjoys popularity from southern Bungoma, specifically Kanduyi and Bumula, while Lusaka is favoured in Mr Elgon where his running mate Hillary Chongwony is from.
