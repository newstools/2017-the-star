Some teen mothers are returning to class, as low enrollment of girls raises concerns. Some are beating the odds and juggling motherhood and schoolwork. A check of schools in Eldama Ravine, Baringo county, revealed an increased number of girls have gone back to class a few months after delivering. Mary Changole, a form two student at Simotwet Secondary School and a mother of a seven-month-old baby, said when she got pregnant at the age of 14, she had no idea what motherhood was about. &ldquo;The father of my child disappeared immediately I conceived. I was broken hearted. I&rsquo;m now determined to excel,&rdquo; she said.Rose Rotich, 15, said, &ldquo; After school, I help my mother with house chores. I sleep at midnight as I try to complete my homework.&rdquo; She is in form one and has a 10-month-old baby. Teen mothers cope with the help of the National Government Constituency Development Fund bursaries. Area subcounty Director of Education Richard Obonyo said NGCDF allocation should be increased to ensure every child gets an education.
