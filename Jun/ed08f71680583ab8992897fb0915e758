An athlete, David Kiprotich collapsed and died on Thursday morning while training at Kaptagat, Eldoret. Kiprotich was pronounced dead on arrival at the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital. “He resides at Chirchir shopping centre. We usually converge for training in the morning. The day’s program was to cover 30km but after the seventh kilometre, I just saw him fall down,” athlete Laban Mutai said. Mutai said Kiprotich did not have any health issues and was very disciplined to his training programme. “We did first aid before I went back to the camp to get my car to take him to the hospital. However when I arrived he had been rushed by another person,” Mutai added. In 2013, Geoffrey Tarno who had led the Kimbilio Marathon up to 41 km in Uasin Gishu County collapsed and died mysteriously. The following year, Edwin Kipkosgei Kipchumba collapsed and died in while training with his colleagues along Eldoret-Kimumu road. Kipchumba was the first Kenyan athlete to win Deaflympic marathon gold medal in Melbourne, Australia in 2005.
