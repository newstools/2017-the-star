At least 200 integrated IDPs in Nyandarua have protested the exclusion of their names from a list of beneficiaries of Sh382 million presented by Deputy President William Ruto on Sunday. They found their names missing from the list when they went to inquire at the assistant county commissioner&rsquo;s office in Ol Kalou.They said most of the names on the list are fake. They urged the government to suspend the compensation process to establish the genuine IDPs.&ldquo;We wonder where our names are. We registered at the chief&rsquo;s office,&rdquo; Beth Wairimu said.Simon Kariuki said he voted at Langas Primary School, Eldoret, in December 2007. &ldquo;But now I cannot get even Sh50,000, while there are people who got Sh400,000. Why does the government fail to ensure justice?&rdquo; he asked.
