ANC wants ODM to compel its candidates in Western to step down.ANC secretary general Godfrey Osotsi said his party has sacrificed a lot for ODM and it&rsquo;s about time its leaders reciprocate.He said parties should be governed by good faith and ODM should know that. Osostsi spoke on Saturday at Ivona Primary School, Vihiga county, during the launch of Sabatia MP Alfred Agoi&rsquo;s manifesto.&ldquo;Our ODM counterparts should not have fielded candidates in ANC strongholds of Western, especially in Vihiga. Why should ODM compete with ANC in this region,&rdquo; he said.Osotsi said voters know that ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi formed NASA, registered it and shelved his presidential ambitions for ODM&rsquo;s Raila Odinga. The secretary general said, &ldquo;We are campaigning and we will vote for Raila as our president, but the rest should be ANC.&rdquo;Osotsi also said it is wrong for ANC officials to campaign for independent candidates, yet they have their own.His sentiments will be a blow to Emuhaya MP Wilbur Otichilo, who is vying for Vihiga governor on the ODM ticket.Vihiga MP Yusuf Chanzu is contesting for the same seat on the ANC ticket.Last month, Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula&rsquo;s Ford Kenya insisted the county is purely its zone and the Orange party candidates should be locked out. But ODM does not seem to want to cede ground.Sources say the Senator has been asking Raila, to prevail upon ODM candidates in Bungoma to step down for those under his party, but that he has been unsuccessful.Wafula Wamunyinyi, who is Kanduyi MP and Ford Kenya&rsquo;s Bungoma chairman, said they will not allow ODM candidates to campaign there.&ldquo;We made sacrifices as a party and our leader stepped down for Raila. What is so difficult in them sacrificing Bungoma seats for us?&rdquo; he asked.
