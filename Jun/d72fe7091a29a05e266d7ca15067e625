Viagra is among the most common counterfeit drugs coming into Kenya, the Pharmacy and Poisons Board has said. Dennis Otieno, head of crime investigation and enforcement in the board, said viagra is among the lifestyle medicines sneaked into the country regularly. Lifestyle medicines are those that treat non-life threatening conditions such as baldness, wrinkles, erectile dysfunction or skin conditions. "What we have mostly been seizing at the ports of entry to Kenya is different kinds of falsified viagra," Otieno said on Wednesday. He spoke on Wednesday on the sidelines of a two-day conference on Combating Counterfeit and Piracy in Mombasa. Otieno e said in February, two people were charged with illegal possession of viagra worth Sh44 million. The consignment was seized at the Jomo Kenyatta International Hospital as the two waited to pick it up for distribution. A United Nations study released last month noted that the Mombasa port experiences high levels of trafficking of fake pharmaceuticals, including antimalarials, antibiotics, analgesics, anti-inflammatory and gastro-intestinal drugs. Peter Kiptoo, head of the port of entry unit of the Pharmacy boar, said Kenya is combating counterfeit products through inter-agency cooperation. The board has been working with the Anti-Counterfeit Agency and the Kenyan Revenue Authority to curb the menace, he said. Wilfrid Roge, of the Institute of Research Against Counterfeit Medicines, said an estimated $75 billion in revenue is lost due to counterfeit drugs. He said about 100,000 people die every year globally as a result of the same. "We need to work to combat this issue," he said, adding that 10 per cent of global drugs are fake, illicit or counterfeit. Sandra Wens, of the World Customs Organisation, said countries need to cooperate to combat counterfeit drugs, noting a majority come from India and China. Participants from 27 countries of the world are attending the conference organised by
the KRA, WCO and IRACM.
