The Anti-Corruption Court has set the hearing of an appeal seeking to quash the acquittal of former Foreign Affairs PS Thuita Mwangi and two others in the Tokyo embassy case for July 24.Mwangi and three others were accused of graft in authorising payment in the Sh1.3 billion scandal and it emerged the building was bought at an inflated cost.Kenya lost Sh185.5 million in the purchase.DPP Keriako Tobiko, through senior state counsel Daniel Karuri appealed against the lower court's decision of acquitting the suspects.In his renewed bid to have Mwangi and his co-accused held liable over the illegal purchase of the Kenyan Embassy in Tokyo, Tobiko says the decision to clear them was wrong and should be reversed.When the matter came up for mention, judge Hedwig Ong'udi said the appeal should be heard without further delay.The DPP said chief magistrate Kennedy Bidali failed to analyse the evidence presented against the former PS, former charg&eacute;s d'affaires at the embassy, Allan Mburu, and former deputy director of administration in the ministry Anthony Muchiri.Bidali was wrong to clear the three on counts of conspiracy to commit an offence of corruption and failure to comply with the procurement law, despite making a finding that there were many violations of procurement procedures, he says.Earlier, the judge had directed the DPP to respond to a letter dated March 18, 2016, written to him by Muchiri. He had asked him to investigate the circumstances that made magistrate Doreen Mulekyo withdraw from the case.The magistrate disqualified herself in January 2016, citing &ldquo;unfortunate remarks&rdquo; allegedly made by a prosecutor.Mulekyo said although the prosecutor apologised to the court and the defence team &ldquo;it is my considered view that the matter be put to rest&rdquo;.She concluded, &ldquo;It would, however, appear the comment has since taken a life of its own and it is no longer tenable for me to continue to hear this matter.&rdquo;Mwangi, Muchiri and Mburu want the DPP to notify them of the results of the investigations. And in the event anyone from the DPP&rsquo;s office is implicated, the three want action taken against the person.
