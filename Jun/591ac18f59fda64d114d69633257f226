A Democratic congressman wants to ensure all of Donald Trump&rsquo;s tweets are preserved for posterity.The Independent reported on Monday that this will be for records of misspellings, typos and all.The news outlet said representative Mike Quigley has introduced the Communications Over Various Feeds Electronically for Engagement Act, also known as the COVFEFE Act, for the cause.The proposed will require the preservation of Trump&rsquo;s tweets by the National Archive and Records Administration (NARA).This followed one of Trump&rsquo;s notorious tweets in which he condemned 'negative press covfefe' and did not acknowledge the error for more than six hours."The act is more than just a dig at the President," the Independent quotes the congressman, adding that in order to maintain public trust in government, elected officials must answer for what they do and say."This includes 140-character tweets," Quigley said in a statement attributed by the media outlet.He said if the President is going to take to social media to make sudden public policy proclamations, they will ensure that the same is documented and preserved for future reference. Trump&rsquo;s tweets have become an increasing source of concern for Republican and Democrats alike.The US head of state, via Twitter, recently attacked the mayor of London and also threatened former FBI Director James Comey with 'tapes' of their conversations.
