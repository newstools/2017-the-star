The private universities face hard times after the vast
majority of those who qualified for intake were absorbed by the public
universities (see P14). One result of falling undergraduate numbers in private universities
is the closure announced yesterday of four campuses of the University of
Eastern Africa, Baraton, and the laying off of close to 1,000 staff. Baraton follows in the footsteps of Kemu, which also closed
a number of campuses earlier this year. It is a good thing the public universities are absorbing so
many students. And it is high time the private campuses developed alternative
plans to become more creative and innovative with their programmes. The example
of Strathmore University, which is fully functional, is instructive. They could borrow a leaf from the former polytechnics, which
are making a comeback as technical and vocational training institutions under
the TVET Board, which regulates, registers and accredits institutions,
programmes and trainers. After all, Education CS Fred Matiangâ€™i has said more than
once the state has plans to include private universities in admitting
state-funded students.
