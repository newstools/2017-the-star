Homa Bay ODM officials who support the party's opponents for the August 8 polls will be sacked, the county's leaders warned on Monday.Chairperson Gladys Wanga (woman MP), Governor Cyprian Awiti, and Senator Moses Kajwang accused the officials of negating the party's ideology.They said the officials have violated rules requiring them to embrace the six-piece voting pattern by openly campaigning for other candidates.In a meeting held at Awiti&rsquo;s home in Mawego village, Karachuonyo, Wanga declared that the lot will no longer hold office."It is mandatory that we speak with one voice. The party has decided to go six-piece hence all ODM officials should rally voters to this cause," she said."Anybody who goes against the party principles ceases to be our member hence they must quit their positions."The Homa Bay woman representative said they will conduct a meeting to replace the officials."We have many people who want to serve the party so that our leader Raila Odinga wins the presidential election. We will give them that chance," she added.Raila has been rallying the voters to embrace a six-piece voting pattern to give the party numerical strength in parliament.Read: Rebellion, worry in Nyanza over Raila's six-piece voting planAlso read: Don't vote for independent candidates, Raila tells NASA supportersThe leaders claimed the officials are the main obstacles in ODM's bid to win governor, senator, MP, woman representative, and MCA seats."In the 2013 elections, ODM won all the eight MP, the governor and senator seats in the county. We need a repeat of the same."The officials on the spot for backing independents hail from each of the eight constituencies and are in office.Kajwang&rsquo; said the decision will save the party adding that it will be costly for ODM to have people who sing different tunes during campaigns.""They should pave way for others since we can&rsquo;t afford to have a lacuna in the party," he said.Awiti urged aspirants to forget their political differences and spread the gospel of the six-piece pattern."We have buried the hatchet over the differences that occurred during the ODM nominations," he said. "We are now focused and committed to delivering many seats for ODM and making Raila's presidency strong."The Governor said their campaigns in the county will be led by ODM nominees.The same warning was issued by Bondo ODM secretary Gideon Ochanda, who noted there is no way those vying as independent candidates or under other political parties can remain in ODM.Read: Support ODM candidates or get replaced, Bondo officials warned
