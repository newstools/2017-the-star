A Congolese woman has sued the Nairobi Women&rsquo;s Hospital, Adams branch, for detaining her for nine months for nonpayment of a Sh2.3 million bill. In an affidavit filed under a certificate of urgency, Nkosi Mangaribe said she is a single mother whose children are fully dependent on her and her continued detention threatens their only source of livelihood.She said the hospital has refused to execute an agreement to allow her to pay the bill in installments as she fends for her children, who have been since kicked out of the house. The applicant asked for the urgent intervention of the court as &ldquo;my rights and those of my children are being violated&rdquo;. Mangaribe also wants the court to give orders that pending the hearing and determination of the case, the hospital be ordered to immediately release her.
