United Democratic Party presidential candidate Cyrus Jirongo yesterday said he will hit the campaign trail next week.Jirongo will meet all aspirants running for seats on his party ticket before launching his campaigns officially.&ldquo;We will start with Western before moving to Kisii, Rift Valley, Coast, Nairobi and Eastern to explain to Kenyans why it&rsquo;s important to vote out Jubilee,&rdquo; he said on the phone.Jirongo added that he is in the race because Luhyas arer tired of voting for other candidates every election year.The former Lugari MP said Luhyas will determine the next President because they have the numerical strength.Jirongo earlier said he would not run for President if NASA picked ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi as its flagbearer.The entry of Jirongo into the race will most likely split the vote in Western region, where NASA enjoys massive support.Jirongo was instrumental in the YK92&rsquo;, an outfit that helped retired President Daniel Moi retain power at the advent of multiparty politics in Kenya in 1992.
