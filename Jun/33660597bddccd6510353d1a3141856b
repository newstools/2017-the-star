The government seems to be handling its subsidised maize intervention in self-defeating ways. The arrest of traders in Eastern for allegedly selling the foodstuff at above the price cap of Sh90 is not the way to go.What Jubilee government needs to do is a major rethink of its distribution system and to introduce incentives for retailers and wholesalers to sell unga at Sh90 per 2kg pack.The focus on unga is not well-thought-out. There are other cost-of-living issues that need to be addressed like yesterday.Recommended retail prices in a free market are observed more in the breach than the observance, as any beer or soda drinker in Nairobi (and elsewhere) can tell you.Sellers of unga have their costs too, including transportation, and it will oppress them mightily to have to sell at a loss.Continuing to arrest and otherwise harass traders is definitely not right. What&rsquo;s more, it plays right into Opposition NASA&rsquo;s hands as regards their &ldquo;unga revolution&rdquo; campaign narrative.It&rsquo;s back to the drawing board for the JP administration.
