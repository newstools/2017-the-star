Vicious turf wars have rocked Parliament over a far-reaching bill seeking to establish a power symmetry in the bicameral House.Senate and National Assembly leaders are locking horns over the Parliamentary Service Bill, 2017, a key piece of legislation tailored to remedy power imbalances and supremacy battles.The law&rsquo;s enactment is long overdue. Its absence has fanned frequent squabbles between leaders of the two Houses over the control of billions of shillings allocated to Parliament annually.Parliament, through its administrative organ &mdash; the Parliamentary Service Commission &mdash; has been allocated a staggering Sh36.6 billion in the 2017-18 budget.The PSC Bill, one of the constitutional bills yet to be enacted by the August House seven years later, seeks to align the administrative structure of Parliament with the 2010 Constitution.The bill was first published in October 2015 but was not enacted by the House, leading to its lapsing at the end of the last session of Parliament.Parliament is currently operating on the obsolete Parliamentary Service Act 2000, which the proposed law seeks to repeal and reenact.The redundant act contains a lot of administrative inconsistencies and does not provide for clear-cut roles for the separate and distinct clerks of the two chambers.The PSC Act 2000, on which Parliament currently operates, did not envisage the bicameral House and is therefore blamed for existing administrative gaps undermining harmony in parliamentary operations.&lsquo;STUMBLING BLOCK&rsquo;Requirements of the Fifth Schedule of the constitution provide that Parliament must review statutes of all constitutional commissions that existed before the enactment of the 2010 Constitution.The House already reviewed the Statutes of the Public Service Commission and the Judicial Service Commission &mdash; the other two constitutional commissions that existed together with the PSC prior to the 2010 Constitution.This means the PSC is the only constitutional body whose operation and existence is not in compliance with strict provisions of the 2010 Constitution.National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale lifted the lid on behind-the-scenes manoeuvres surrounding the key proposed law, accusing Senate clerk Jeremiah Nyegenye of blocking the enactment of the key law.&ldquo;He is the only person standing in the way of this bill,&rdquo; Duale said.The Garissa Township MP defended the controversial Bill, saying it will establish power symmetry in the bicameral House.The bill also seeks to limit the tenure of the Senate and National Assembly clerks to a maximum of two terms. Currently, clerks retire at the age of 60.&ldquo;There is no way a clerk can serve for 20 years. We want a clerk to serve one renewable term and exit after serving two terms for best practice,&rdquo; Duale said.He dismissed claims the bill would create power imbalance in the House, adding that with National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi, PSC chairman and Senate clerk as Secretary, there is already balance.&ldquo;Nobody should be worried. This is a fantastic bill. Nothing makes the Senate clerk the accounting officer of the PSC,&rdquo; Duale said.He said no powers will be clipped from the Senate clerk as alleged, as both clerks already have authority to incur expenditure.MPs in 2014 amended the Public Finance Management Act to give the National Assembly clerk authority to incur expenditure, following supremacy tussles. However, the amendment was not simultaneously effected in the constitution, as the initial PSC Bill had been rejected.ACCOUNTING ROLE QUESTIONEDIn a sign of the simmering turf wars, the Senate has written to the National Assembly seeking to have input on the bill, arguing it touches on the commission.However, Duale and Muturi fired back, saying only bills concerning counties are referred to the Senate.Senate Speaker Ekwe Ethuro wrote to the National Assembly cautioning against the enactment of the bill, which touches on the commission without involving the Senate.Ethuro warned that should the bill sail through without the participation of the Senate, it will deal a blow to the country&rsquo;s legislative process and weaken the Senate.&ldquo;An administratively weak and dysfunctional Senate leaves counties and their governments without the robust constitutional custodians at the national level ordained under the constitution and undermines their negotiating power,&rdquo; Ethuro wrote.The Senate is rattled by the bill, which they say seeks to clip Nyegenye&rsquo;s powers as the &ldquo;accounting officer&rdquo; of Parliament. Currently, Nyegenye as PSC secretary controls the billions allocated to Parliament.There are also concerns that the Senate clerk could have usurped powers to be the accounting officer, yet the constitution only mentions him as the Secretary to the PSC.&ldquo;There is no provision in the constitution designating the clerk of the Senate, or any other officer for that matter, as an accounting officer. Article 127( 3 ) of the constitution only designates the clerk of the Senate as the secretary to the commission and curiously stops at that designation. Matters of who is to hold accounting powers are left to the wisdom of the legislature,&rdquo; Duale said.Ethuro argues that clipping the Senate clerk&rsquo;s accounting mandate will see the House get lesser attention at the commission level, including underfunding.&ldquo;The secretary to the commission... is not a member of the commission but an officer of the commission required ... to provide secretariat services to the commission. He has no vote or decision making powers,&rdquo; Duale said in the letter.Nyegenye&rsquo;s &lsquo;accounting&rsquo; responsibilities are said to be the cause of supremacy wars pitting the Senate against the National Assembly, with the proposed law aimed at resolving the anomaly.CONFLICTING MANDATESThe Senate budget is less than a third the billions allocated to the PSC, yet its clerk wields sweeping powers in the management of funds as the accounting officer of Parliament.The National Assembly controls over 60 per cent of the total budget, while the Directorate of Joint Services controls about 30 per cent.The proposed bill, signed by Duale on behalf of the government, provides for distinct roles of the two clerks and their mandate, with focus on the administration of their Houses, as opposed to the current situation, where some of their mandates conflict with those of other departments.Under the Bill, clerks will have powers to be the accounting officers of their own Houses, controlling both money and human capital.In enhancing efficiency and effectiveness in service delivery, the bill seeks to entrench into the law the office of joint services, to be headed by a director general appointed by the PSC.The office holder shall be responsible for such services jointly shared by the two Houses of Parliament. The office is not provided for under the Parliamentary Service Act 2000, now outdated.The proposed law makes the two clerks of the bicameral House equal with similar roles to be in charge of their respective Houses as accounting officers.This is meant to bring about power balance in the administration of the two Houses and limit the resource tussles that have rocked the two clerks.The clerks will be responsible for day-to-day functioning of the two houses.&ldquo;....in carrying out and exercising the power conferred by the standing orders and practices of the respective House of Parliament, be under the direction of the Speaker of the relevant House,&rdquo; reads the bill.The proposed law strips the secretary to the PSC of the accounting roles and shares the functions between the two clerks of Parliament.As secretary to the PSC, the clerk of the Senate will handle minuting and a lot of paperwork. The published bill seeks to cure this legal anomaly by providing for functions of the two clerks.&ldquo;In light of this and other changes in the constitutional regime, it has become necessary to review the Parliamentary Service Act in order to ensure that it complies with the provisions of the Constitution of Kenya 2010,&rdquo; reads the bill.
