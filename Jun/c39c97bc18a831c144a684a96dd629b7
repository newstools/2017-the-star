For the first time, new diagnoses of HIV have fallen among men who have sex with men in England, according to data from Public Health England.They have decreased from 2,060 in 2014-15 to 1,700 in 2015-16, while in London there was an even steeper drop.PHE said increased testing, fast treatment with HIV therapy and the use of preventative drug Prep have all contributed to the trend.New HIV diagnoses among heterosexuals have remained stable.While huge advances have been made in treating HIV/Aids, there has been frustration at a lack of progress in reducing the number of men being diagnosed each year.New infections in the UK had been stuck at about 3,000 every year in the five years up to 2015.Valerie Delpech, head of HIV surveillance for Public Health England, said: "What we are seeing is the first downturn of the HIV epidemic in gay men."She added: "There is absolutely no reason why we cannot scale that up to further reduce new infections in gay men - and also in all people who may be at risk of HIV in the UK, regardless of gender, ethnicity or sexuality."Published in the journal Eurosurveillance, the PHE study looked at data from 200 sexual health clinics in England.
