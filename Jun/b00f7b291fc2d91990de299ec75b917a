Amani National Congress secretary general Godfrey Osotsi has cautioned ODM against turning NASA into a tool for seeking the presidency in total disregard of parties affiliated to the alliance.Speaking in Matete on Tuesday, Osotsi said the simmering rivalry in the NASA tent should be addressed by the alliance co-principals urgently, and if not, each party should operate independently. He had gone to condole with the family of Chevaywa ward ANC youth leader Gerishom Kwoba, who was allegedly killed by an ODM supporter on Monday night.Analysts say stiff internal competition among candidates from NASA affiliate parties could affect the presidential vote for flagbearer Raila Odinga if mishandled. Osotsi said the greed by ODM to grab all elective posts even after being handed the presidential ticket will cause serious problems across the country and derail the opposition&rsquo;s agenda. &ldquo;I wish to urge our principals to address this matter because it can create more harm than good to NASA. We want urgent dialogue between organs of all the five parties. NASA must operate through mutual consultation among partners and inclusivity so that we can overcome the problem of sibling rivalry within NASA,&rdquo; he said.Osotsi said ANC created NASA and invited other opposition parties to join hands with an aim of removing Jubilee from power. He said they might lose focus because of ODM&rsquo;s disrespect for other affiliates.&ldquo;NASA is not an ODM affair but five equal partners, and that must be respected to win the presidency in August. If we are not ready to respect this, let&rsquo;s not cheat ourselves that we can win the presidency,&rdquo; Osotsi said.NASA parties have been asking Raila to withdraw ODM candidates in Western in favour of either ANC or Ford Kenya.
