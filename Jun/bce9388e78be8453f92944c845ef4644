Coach Francis Kimanzi has been handed a one year contract extension that will see him remain at the helm of struggling former champions Mathare United until December 2018.Kimanzi, whose future was the subject of speculation in local football circles, was set to enter the final six months of his initial two year deal when the second leg begins on June 17. With only two wins from 13 matches and a bottom place ranking to show, the stage was set for his dismissal.However, club Chairman Bob Munro as quoted on the club&rsquo;s official portal insists that Kimanzi is still the right man for the job.&ldquo;In most clubs, if the team is last in the league near the mid-season, the club usually fires the coach but Mathare United isn&rsquo;t like most teams. Instead we have extended the coach&rsquo;s contract and even increased his salary because he had the courage to recruit many talented young players whose quality will become increasingly evident in the second leg this season and in the years ahead,&rdquo; said Munro.Kimanzi, whose assistant Salim Ali has been retained on similar terms, likened the current situation to his formative years in coaching adding that better days lie ahead.&ldquo;I faced a similar situation in 2005 when I had very little experience in coaching. Many players left the club and we were forced to rebuild. That team that we built later won the league in 2008. So I am confident in this project and very soon we will have a very good team,&rdquo; remarked Kimanzi.With his future at the club now secured, Kimanzi can now rest easy and step up preparations for their Kenyan Premier League match against AFC Leopards on Saturday.
