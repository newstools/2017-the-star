Fifteen more were killed in Basin Hargeisa the following day and manayatta were torched.Bura MP Ali Wario, who toured Kalabha, blamed security officers patrolling the disputed border between the Tana River and Kitui counties.Wario said Inspector General of police Joseph Boinnet assured him senior officers will investigate and take appropriate action.&ldquo;The only crime the herders committed was to find pasture and water for their animals due to the biting drought. There is no justification whatsoever for this,&rdquo; the legislator said.
