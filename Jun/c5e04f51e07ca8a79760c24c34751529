NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga suffered humiliation on Sunday after he was jeered when he tried to campaign for Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga.Irate youths heckled at Raila in front of the other NASA principals at his Bondo backyard.Raila had asked his supporters to use the six-piece voting pattern during the elections, but they all raised their voice and waved their hands in disapproval."Six-piece" voting system is where voters vote for President, Governor, Senator, Women Rep, Member of National Assembly and Member of County Assembly from one party.&ldquo;Do not embarrass me, ensure that our team comprising of Governor, Senator, Women representative, MP and MCA are one team,&rdquo; Raila told the crowd.Governor Rasanga clinched the ODM primaries ticket for re-election but his rival Nicholas Gumbo rejected the results, saying they were not transparent.Rasanga garnered 143,446 votes while Gumbo got 87,467.Raila was accompanied by NASA's top brass Kalonzo Musyoka, Musalia Mudavadi and Moses Wetangula.Mombasa governor Hassan Joho and Siaya Senator James Orengo were also present. This is the second time Odinga has suffered a blow in his home turf when trying to advocate for Rasanga&rsquo;s re-election bid under the guise of the six-piece voting pattern.Read; Joho, Orengo and Oduol endorse Rasanga, promote ODM's six-piece votingLast month in Bondo town accompanied by politicians from Rift Valley, the governor was jeered and booed by a charged crowd forcing him to cut short his speech.The crowd seemed to have a soft spot for Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo who is seeking to oust Rasanga.&ldquo;If we have an ODM governor here in Siaya, it will be easy for me to source for resources and channel it down to our counties unlike where there is an independent governor,&rdquo; Raila said.&ldquo;We do not want Madoadoa (mixed parties) in Siaya County,&rdquo; he added.Musalia Mudavadi pleaded with the Bondo electorates not to disappoint Raila Odinga by voting independent candidates at the expense of NASA candidates.Mudavadi added that together with Wetangula and Musyoka they had expressed interest for vying for the presidency only to shelve their ambitions and rally their support behind Odinga for the sake of the country as a whole.&ldquo;You need to show a good example to "Baba too" by voting his preferred way, who are you not to shelve your ambitions if we did the same?&rdquo; posed Mudavadi.Kalonzo who was invited to address the public steered clear off the six-piece advocacy and instead assured Siaya people that the fifth president of the Republic of Kenya would originate from Siaya County.Rasanga who braved the hostile reception was invited after Mombasa governor Hasan Joho, he agitated for a six-piece voting pattern to the dismissal of the irate public.Read: Rasanga clinches ODM seat, defeats Gumbo in Siaya nominations
