The OCPD said the three were killed with a car's steering rod and that investigators also found blood stains in the living room. “The injuries on their heads and chests may have been inflicted using a blunt object. We collected a bloody steering rod from the scene." Njeri’s friend Jane Wanja said the couple used to quarrel a lot and at times she would be beaten badly by her husband. “They would quarrel during the day and at night. At times we would hear her crying after she is beaten. I would feel bad but there is nothing I would have done” she added. Kabage who is a matatu driver in the area,  on the material day, parked a second hand Nissan matatu he had bought at a car wash in the area before proceeding to commit the brutal murder. A car wash attendant who didn’t want to be named said Kabage asked them to wash saying he would pick it the following day but they never saw him again. “We have been calling his mobile phone but it has been switched off. We wanted him to come and collect this van from our place of work” he said. The bodies of the mothers and her two children were taken to PCEA Kikuyu Hospital mortuary.
