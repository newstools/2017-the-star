World 1500m silver medallist Elijah Manangoi and Olympic 800m bronze medallist Margaret Nyairera and world junior steeplechase champion Norah Jeruto warmed up for the national trials with impressive performances at the Oslo Bislett Games on Thursday.The trio are among athletes invited for the trials where Kenya will be selecting its squad for the Augusts IAAF World Championships in London.Manangoi placed second after losing to the Briton Jake Wightman, who took more than a second off his personal best to win in 3:34.17.In his wake, the 22-year-old left some of the world&rsquo;s most accomplished metric milers, with Kenya&rsquo;s Manangoi - who has a personal best of 3:29.67 - clocking 3:34.30 and the hugely experienced Polish athlete Marcin Lewandowski third in a personal best of 3:34.60.On Friday, Manangoi will be up against the likes of three-time world 1500m champion Asbel Kiprop and Ronald Kwemoi, who has impressed this season in the diamond league circuit.South Africa&rsquo;s Caster semenya re-affirmed her supremacy in the race women&rsquo;s 800m as alongside Francine Niyonsaba ensured that Nyairera finished third in a repeat of the Rio Olympics final positioning.As the field entered the final straight it looked, for a moment, as if Niyonsaba was going to achieve a rare victory over Semenya.The Burundi athlete, her white singlet blustering, showed the strain on her face as she pushed for home. Behind her, and then alongside her, and then in front of her, the face of the Olympic and world champion was impassive as she maintained her now customary dominance of the two-lap event, winning in 1:57.79.Niyonsaba was second in a season&rsquo;s best of 1:58.18, with early leader Nyairera third in 1:59.17.World champion Eunice Sum faded to tenth clocking 2:03.04.Jeruto clocked 9:17.27 to beat Ethiopia&rsquo;s Sofia Assefa (9:17.34) to second as Kenya&rsquo;s Purity Cherotich finished fourth in 9.25.82.
