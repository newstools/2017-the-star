Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga has expressed fears that his chances of retaining the seat are slim, following infiltration by his arch-rival and Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo in his Alego/Usonga backyard.Gumbo will run for governor as an independent.Rasanga pleaded with ODM to send a strong team to the ground to help him campaign and win back supporters, who he said have been lured by strong pro-independent candidates led by Gumbo and Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo.The governor claimed Gumbo has been traversing his backyard, despite the area being an ODM stronghold.Rasanga said due to Gumbo&rsquo;s notable presence in his backyard, he has been unable to venture outside Alego/Usonga to seek votes from other regions. &ldquo;The situation in Alego/Usonga is bad. This guy still penetrates up to the inner parts, dishing out lesos and money to our people,&rdquo; the governor said.He spoke on Friday in Pap Boro, when the Nyanza NASA presidential campaign team led by nominated MP Oburu Oginga met the region&rsquo;s ODM brigade.Rasanga criticised area ODM chairman Orwenjo Umidha for &ldquo;abdicating his responsibilities&rdquo; of ensuring that non-ODM candidates are locked out from campaigning in the region.He told Umidha to rein in wayward ODM officials, who have divided loyalty between ODM and independent candidates. &ldquo;Some ODM officials pretend to work with us during the day and later pay allegiance to independent candidates at night. This includes leaking information to them,&rdquo; Rasanga said.The governor asked the ODM team to put the region &ldquo;under lock and key&rdquo; to bar independents, as he struggles to stamp his authority on other regions as the election date draws near.Rasanga was accompanied by Oburu, former MPs Joe Donde (Gem) and Paddy Ahenda (Kabondo Kasipul) and Alego/Usonga ODM parliamentary nominee Sam Atandi.Early this month, Rasanga told Gumbo to stop causing confusion by using the ODM colours. He said the law is clear on symbols and colours of political parties and the independents.But Gumbo accused Rasanga of using relief food to lure voters, saying it is against the law to campaign using the state machine.
